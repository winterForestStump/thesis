Products
Semiconductor components are the building blocks used in electronic systems and equipment. These components are classified as either discrete devices, such as individual transistors, or as ICs, in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated electronic circuit.
Our ICs are designed to address a wide range of real-world signal processing applications. We sell our ICs to customers worldwide, many of whom use products spanning our core technologies in a wide range of applications. Our IC product portfolio includes both general-purpose products used by a broad range of customers and applications, as well as application-specific products designed for specific target markets. By using readily available, high-performance, general-purpose products in their systems, our customers can reduce the time they need to bring new products to market. Given the high cost of developing more customized ICs, our standard products often provide a cost-effective solution for many low to medium volume applications. Our analog ICs monitor, condition, amplify or transform continuous analog signals associated with physical properties, such as temperature, pressure, weight, light, sound or motion, and play an important role in bridging real world phenomena to a variety of electronic systems. Our analog ICs also provide voltage regulation and power control to electronic systems.
We also work with customers to design application-specific solutions. We begin with our existing core technologies, which leverage our analog and mixed signal, power management, RF and microwave, edge processors and other sensors, and devise solutions that more closely meet the needs of a specific customer or group of customers. In certain cases, because we have already developed the core technology platform for our general-purpose products, we can create application-specific solutions quickly and efficiently.
Our analog and mixed-signal IC technology have been the foundation of our business for over five decades, and we are one of the worlds largest suppliers of high-performance analog ICs. Our analog signal processing ICs are primarily high-performance devices, offering higher dynamic range, greater bandwidth and other enhanced features. We believe that the principal advantages these products have as compared to competitors products include higher accuracy, higher speed, lower cost per function, smaller size, lower power consumption and fewer components, resulting in improved performance and reliability. Our product portfolio includes several thousand analog ICs, many of which can have several hundred end customers. Our analog ICs typically have long product life cycles. Our customers include original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and customers who build electronic subsystems for integration into larger systems.
Our product offerings include more than 75,000 stock keeping units (SKUs) that can be aggregated into the following general categories:
Analog and Mixed Signal-We are a leading supplier of data converter products. Data converters translate real-world analog signals into digital data and also translate digital data into analog signals. Data converters remain our largest and most diverse product family and an area where we are continuously innovating to enable our customers to redefine and differentiate their products. Our converter products combine sampling rates and accuracy with the low noise, power, price and small package size required by industrial, automotive, consumer, and communications electronics.
Power Management & Reference-Power management and reference products, which include functions such as power conversion, driver monitoring, sequencing and energy management, provide efficient solutions for power management and conversion applications in the automotive, communications, industrial and high-end consumer markets. Our high-performance power ICs include powerful performance, integration and software design simulation tools to provide fast and accurate power supply designs.
Amplifiers/RF and Microwave-We are also a leading supplier of high-performance amplifiers which are used to condition analog signals. High performance amplifiers emphasize the performance dimensions of speed and precision. Within this product portfolio we provide precision, instrumentation, high speed, intermediate frequency/RF/microwave, broadband, and other amplifiers. Our analog product line also includes a broad portfolio of high-performance RF and microwave ICs covering the entire RF signal chain. Our high-performance RF and microwave ICs support the high-performance requirements of cellular infrastructure and a broad range of applications in our target markets, including instrumentation, aerospace and automotive.
Sensors & Actuators-Our analog technology portfolio is comprised of sensor and actuator products, including products based on micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) technology. MEMS technology enables us to build extremely small sensors that incorporate an electromechanical structure and the supporting analog circuitry for conditioning signals obtained from the sensing element. Our MEMS product portfolio includes accelerometers used to sense acceleration, gyroscopes used to sense rotation, inertial measurement units used to sense multiple degrees of freedom combining multiple sensing types along multiple axes, and broadband switches suitable for radio and instrument systems. We offer other high-performance sensors, from temperature to magnetic fields, that are deployed in a variety of systems. In addition to sensor products, our other analog product category includes isolators that enable designers to implement isolation in designs without the cost, size, power, performance, and reliability constraints found with optocouplers.
Digital Signal Processing and System Products (DSPs)-DSPs are optimized for high-speed numeric calculations, which are essential for instantaneous, or real-time, processing of digital data generated, in most cases, from analog to digital signal conversion. Our DSPs are designed to be fully programmable and to efficiently execute specialized software programs, or algorithms, associated with processing digitized real-time, real-world data. Programmable DSPs are designed to provide the flexibility to modify the devices function quickly and inexpensively using software. Our general-purpose DSP IC customers typically write their own algorithms using software development tools provided by us and third-party suppliers. Our DSPs are designed in families of products that share common architectures and therefore can execute the same software across a range of products.
Sales Channel
We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. We have direct sales offices, sales representatives and/or distributors in over 50 countries. We support our worldwide sales efforts through our website and with extensive promotional programs that include editorial coverage and paid advertising in online and printed trade publications, webinars, social media and communities, promotional and training videos, direct mail programs, technical seminars and participation in trade shows. We publish, share and distribute technical content such as data sheets, application guides and catalogs. We maintain a staff of field application engineers who aid customers in incorporating our products into their products. In addition, we offer a variety of web-based tools that ease product selection and aid in the design process for our customers.
We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition.
These distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. Some of them also sell products that compete with our products, including those for which we are an alternate source. We make sales to distributors under agreements that allow certain distributors to receive price adjustment credits and to return qualifying products for credit, as determined by us, in order
to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. These agreements limit such returns to a certain percentage of our shipments to that distributor during the prior quarter. In addition, certain distributors are allowed to return unsold products if we terminate the relationship with the distributor. Additional information relating to our revenue and customer concentration is set forth in Note 2l, Concentrations of Risk; Note 2n, Revenue Recognition; and Note 4, Industry, Segment and Geographic Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In some of our markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demand. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, those orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customers unique requirements such that those canceled orders would result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs.

Competition
We believe that competitive performance in the marketplace for signal processing products depends upon multiple factors, including technological innovation, strength of brand, diversity of product portfolio, product performance, technical support, delivery capabilities, customer service quality, reliability and price, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets, and customers. We compete with a number of semiconductor companies in markets that are highly competitive. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.

Seasonality
Our sales are subject to a varying degree of seasonality. Historically, sales to customers during our first fiscal quarter may be lower than other quarters due to plant shutdowns at some of our customers. In general, the seasonality for any specific period of time has not had a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, as explained in our risk factors contained in
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business. For more information, see the section titled Note About Forward-Looking Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks Related to our Business, Operations, Industry and Partners
Global political and economic uncertainty and adverse conditions related to our international operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. As a result of our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by, among others, the following factors:
political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest that may impact markets in which we do business, such as macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China, tensions across the Taiwan Strait that may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan, our customers and the technology industry supply chain, and the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas and between Russia and Ukraine;
compliance requirements of customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;
currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of elevated interest rates;
instability of global credit and financial markets due to adverse macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and slower economic growth or recession that could, among other impacts, affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms or lead to financial difficulties or uncertainty of our customers, suppliers and distributors exposing us to late payments, cancelled orders and inventory challenges;
trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly with respect to China;
sanctions imposed by governments in countries in which we do business, including those imposed on Russia by, among others, the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom in response to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which sanctions restrict a wide range of trade and financial dealings with Russian and Russian persons, as well as with certain regions in Ukraine;
complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax, price protection, competition practices, export control, customs, immigration, anti-boycott, data privacy, cyber and product security, sustainability, climate and other ESG matters, intellectual property, anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and environmental compliance;
economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the United States and its allies;
increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;
changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;
greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;
natural disasters, public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic events;
transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;
fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs due to general market factors and conditions such as inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints;
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and
increased costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.
Many of these factors and risks are present and may be exacerbated within our business operations in China. For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In addition, expanded export restrictions limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions have created and these and similar restrictions may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by Chinas continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity, data protection and data privacy, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights.
The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.
The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, or we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of underutilization of capacity, charges related to obsolete inventory, asset impairment or inventory write-downs, increased operating expenses or reduced margins. For example, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, periods of customer inventory adjustments that may adversely affect our operating results. Further, any capacity expansions by us or other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that could adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.
We rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services.
We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors and freight carriers (collectively, vendors), in manufacturing and shipping our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, costs and supply chain allocations. We currently source more than half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others. These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. With respect to TSMC in particular, tensions across the Taiwan Strait or other geopolitical events could disrupt TSMCs operations, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and as a result, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies. Limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations. In certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in reputational harm or the temporary or permanent loss of customers, and as a result could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our industry faces challenges associated with products diverted from authorized distribution channels, which could result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors. There is a risk that our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the gray market in ways that are not in accordance with our established agreements, controls, policies and procedures. Purchasers that acquire our products via the gray market or through other unauthorized channels may resell or otherwise use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or that may be contrary to our ethical, legal and regulatory obligations. Organizations may also purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or purchase used products presented as new, each of which could result in damage to property or persons. These situations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and operating results.
A prolonged disruption of our or our third parties manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for certain manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our or our third parties manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our or our third parties manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.
Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions, including those that may incorporate, or are based upon, software or artificial intelligence technology. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations.
Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that the markets we serve and target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.
Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.
Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:
the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products, including inflationary pressures, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased interest rates, fuel prices, wages and other costs;
changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products or for end products that incorporate our products;
the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;
our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;
future distributor pricing credits or stock rotation rights;
our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;
changes in geographic, product or customer mix;
changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide;
the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, including with respect to China;
the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;
pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;
fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;
the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and components;
a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;
a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;
a decline in our backlog;
our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;
our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;
the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement and pension plan contributions and other retirement benefits;
our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;
litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;
the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;
the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide complex government regulations and legal standards and requirements, including those related to ESG matters;
new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and
the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters or other severe weather events, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.
In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. There can be no assurance that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand.
As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis. Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.
We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.
We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may
have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the United States, including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries. From time to time, governments around the world may provide incentives or make other investments that could benefit and give competitive advantages to our competitors. For example, in August 2022, the United States government enacted the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the U.S. semiconductor industry. Government incentives, including any that may be offered in connection with the CHIPS Act, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our competitors can benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our competitors' relative position and have a material adverse effect on our business. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current and new competitors. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years. Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.
If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.
Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense and the labor market is tight. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, timely hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could cause business disruptions, increased expenses to address any disruptions and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.
We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.
We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customers unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. The foregoing risks may be exacerbated in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, including as a result of rising inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and slower economic growth or recession. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products, could adversely affect our operating results.
Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.
A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our
distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.
We are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.
Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.
Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services, including those that may incorporate, or are based upon, software or artificial intelligence technology, could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs or errors, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our reputation and operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant.
Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results.
The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Risk Related to Acquisitions and Strategic Transactions
Our acquisition of Maxim involves a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate.
In August 2021, we completed our acquisition of Maxim, which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger. The ultimate success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability to continue to combine the two businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities. Further, there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must continue to be integrated in connection with the ongoing integration of Maxims business. The combined company has and may continue to incur ongoing restructuring, integration and other costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies in connection with the merger. It is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated and actual growth, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. There can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully in a way
that maximizes the combined business to the fullest extent. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives, the benefits of the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to achieve than expected.
To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.
An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. Both in the United States and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.
Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:
diversion of managements attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;
difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems, infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses;
strain on managerial and operational resources as management oversees larger or more complex operations;
future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;
servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions;
potential loss of key employees;
exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies;
higher than expected or unexpected acquisition or integration costs;
difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and
increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.
If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.
Risks Related to Cyber, Intellectual Property, Legal and Regulatory
Our computer systems and networks may be subject to attempted security breaches and other cyber incidents and a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.
We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases, who may maintain such information on their information technology systems. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or strategic partners may not detect or prevent security breaches, cyberattacks, defects, bugs or errors. Further, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may escalate the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks, thereby making it more difficult to detect, mitigate and defend against them. We and our third-party service providers or strategic partners may be subject to security breaches of information technology systems or certain products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, other cyberattacks or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. In the event of a breach, our operations may be disrupted, our proprietary information or that of our employees, contractors, partners, customers, suppliers or other third parties may be misappropriated, and we could be exposed to potential liability,
litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.
Our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers and strategic partners may also be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.
We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.
Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, make unlicensed copies or engage in unapproved distributions of our technology for unauthorized uses, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.
There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.
We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and may improperly use our proprietary information at their employer.
If we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.
We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations such as the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Chinas Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), or Californias Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws.
In particular, there are numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal data. Such laws and regulations often vary in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR and PIPL include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union or China, as applicable, that are broader and more stringent than those in many other jurisdictions around the world. The GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and Chinas PIPL imposes additional operational requirements relating to processing personal information and provides comprehensive penalty and enforcement mechanisms. In the United States, California enacted the CCPA that requires covered companies to provide additional disclosures and data rights to data subjects, including employees. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will become enforceable in March 2024, expands the CCPA and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce Californians privacy rights under the CCPA. Since the CCPA was enacted, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, have enacted or are in the process of enacting comprehensive privacy schemes.
The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CCPA and similar laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and require us to incur substantial compliance costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, our product offerings in the digital healthcare solutions space, which include the collection and
processing of sensitive personal information, subject us to heightened requirements under data privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Given that the scope, interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be in conflict across jurisdictions, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or third-party service providers to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
We are occasionally involved in litigation, administrative proceedings, and regulatory proceedings, which could be costly to resolve and could require us to redesign products, pay significant royalties or fines or refrain from engaging in specific conduct.
From time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, including inquiries from and discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations, which may result in claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims, or other matters that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. For example, in March 2022, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against us and the former directors of Maxim as described in Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.
Further, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement.
These matters can be time-consuming, divert managements attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows.
Environmental, social and governance matters may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and damage our brand and reputation.
There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers, employees and potential talent, as well as other stakeholders, concerning ESG matters, including climate change and sustainability, human rights, support for local communities, Board of Directors and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, worker rights, supply chain management and corporate governance and transparency. If our ESG practices fail to meet the expectations of investors, customers, employees or other stakeholders evolving standards, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us. Current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing ESG data to inform their decisions, including investment and voting decisions, using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks. Further, customers utilize ESG data to inform their purchasing decisions. Additionally, public interest and legislative and regulatory pressure related to companies ESG practices, including those related to sourcing practices, carbon emissions and human rights protections, continue to grow. This will require us to align our programs to such expectations and disclose an increasing amount of information and data to illustrate our position and progress and to support our customers to comply with regulations and other requirements. If we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet evolving regulatory requirements or the expectations of our investors, customers, employees, regulators or other stakeholders, or if our ESG disclosures, including data input, processing and reporting, are incomplete or inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation could be adversely affected.
We are subject to environment, health and safety standards and hazards which have the potential to adversely affect our business, increase our expenses and adversely affect our reputation.
Our industry is subject to EHS requirements and laws, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances and materials and those that help promote the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. For certain facilities, we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for our operations, which may limit or restrict our operations. In addition, our operations may be interrupted or restricted by the phase-out or ban of certain substances, materials or processes, which may impact the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in manufacturing our products. Further, public attention to environmental and social responsibility remains high, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws, regulations or customer requirements may require us to invest in equipment or make manufacturing process or material changes, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:
liability for damages and remediation;
the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines;
the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products;
changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;
damage to our reputation; or
increased expenses associated with compliance.
If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.
Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract. Further, United States government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that may give the United States government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including certain intellectual property rights and restrictions on future business.
In connection with our United States government business, we are subject to evolving procurement rules and regulations, as well as government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.
Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, which can be time consuming and costly. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts are unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we may be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.
Damage to our reputation can damage our business.
Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described in this Risk Factors section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. We may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and
services. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees and repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate and brand crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands, which could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. If we fail to maintain, enhance and protect our brands, if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused by others trademarks, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.
Increases in our effective tax rate, exposure to additional tax liabilities, or substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance may adversely impact our results of operations.
Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.
A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.
Compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. We do not believe that the IRA will materially impact our effective tax rate. Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high legislative or regulatory priorities in many jurisdictions. Changes in laws and regulations regarding these matters, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations.
Risks Related to Financial Markets, Indebtedness and Capital Return
We have substantial existing indebtedness and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings.
As of October 28, 2023, we had approximately $6.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness, including $0.5 billion of short-term commercial paper. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility that were not being used to backstop our outstanding commercial paper balance. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Further, on October 5, 2021, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes (Floating Rate Notes). Our Floating Rate Notes and our net interest expense is exposed to changes in market interest rates and will increase as market interest rates rise. We may also incur additional debt, including debt with variable interest rates, in the future, which would exacerbate these risks.
Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future operating performance, which may be impacted by general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service or refinance our debt, we may be required to divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations or returned to shareholders, repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential negative tax consequences, or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or
complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on conditions in the debt capital markets. In addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, the applicable interest rate on borrowings under our current revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuances may rise and our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt may be negatively affected.
Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.
Our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.
We may not meet expectations or targets in connection with our green financing arrangements, which could harm our reputation and business.
From time to time, we may enter into green financing arrangements that require us to use proceeds for environmental sustainability purposes or have targets related to environmental sustainability. For example, we entered into a revolving credit agreement on June 23, 2021, which, as amended, contains a sustainability-linked pricing component, which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage. For calendar year 2022, we were within the threshold range for greenhouse gas emissions and exceeded the target threshold for renewable energy usage related to this sustainability-linked pricing component. On October 5, 2021, we issued $750 million sustainability-linked senior notes (Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes). Our Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes initially bear interest at a rate of 1.7% per annum and are subject to an increase of an additional 30 basis points per annum from April 1, 2026 to their maturity on October 1, 2028 unless the Sustainability Performance Target (as defined in the Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes) has been satisfied. Failing to use the net proceeds under green financing arrangements that satisfies investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact or achieve targets related to environmental sustainability under such financing arrangements could result in reputational harm and our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.
If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, issuances under our commercial paper program, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
General Risk Factors
Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events in the locations in which we operate.
We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, flooding, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, global
climate change may result in certain natural disasters or other severe weather events occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe.
The extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.
The COVID-19 pandemic created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption and impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, those of our respective vendors and suppliers and the global capital markets. During the course of the pandemic, many of the countries in which we operate took and may continue to take measures to address the pandemic, which at times has resulted and may continue to result in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities, including restrictions on our access to facilities. We may also be required to take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers, which may cause disruption to our business. The COVID-19 pandemic could also cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section.
Our stock price may be volatile.
The market price of our common stock may be volatile, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:
global economic conditions generally;
crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;
actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;
changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;
financial results and prospects of our customers;
U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;
changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;
rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;
announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;
departures of key personnel;
alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and
negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.
The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies, such as the response to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.
Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.

Revenue Trends by End Market
The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and our methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.

_______________________________________
(1)The sum of the individual percentages may not equal the total due to rounding.
Revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of broad-based demand for our products sold into the Industrial end market, namely aerospace and defense and instrumentation, as well as the Automotive end market, namely cabin electronics and battery management systems. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the Consumer end market primarily due to weakening market trends and a decrease in revenue in the Communications end market due to the timing of infrastructure deployment cycles.
Revenue by Sales Channel
The following table summarizes revenue by sales channel. We sell our products globally through a direct sales force, third party distributors, independent sales representatives and via our website. Distributors are customers that buy products with the intention of reselling them. Direct customers are non-distributor customers and consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Other customers include the U.S. government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers for which revenue is recorded over time.

As indicated in the table above, the percentage of total revenue sold via each channel has remained relatively consistent in the periods presented, but can fluctuate from time to time based on end customer demand.
Revenue Trends by Geographic Region
Revenue by geographic region, based upon the geographic location of the distributors or OEMs who purchased the Company's products, for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was as follows:
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change (1)
United States $ 4,165,296 $ 4,025,398 $ 139,898 3 %

In all periods presented, the predominant regions comprising Rest of North and South America are Canada and Mexico; the predominant regions comprising Europe are Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands; and the predominant regions comprising Rest of Asia are Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea and Singapore.
Total revenue increased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 due to the revenue trends discussed above, partially offset by weaker customer demand in China and Rest of Asia primarily due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in those regions.
Gross Margin
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Gross margin $ 7,877,218 $ 7,532,474 $ 344,744 5 %
Gross margin % 64.0 % 62.7 %
Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2023 increased by 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2022 included $271.4 million of additional cost of goods sold that did not repeat in fiscal 2023 related to a nonrecurring fair value adjustment recorded to inventory. This increase in gross margin percentage was partially offset by lower utilization of our factories due to decreasing customer demand during fiscal 2023.
Research and Development (R&D)
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
R&D expenses $ 1,660,194 $ 1,700,518 $ (40,324) (2) %
R&D expenses as a % of revenue 13 % 14 %
R&D expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 primarily as a result of lower employee related variable compensation expenses, partially offset by higher salary and benefit expenses.
R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year-to-year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts, which we view as critical to our future growth. We expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products. We believe that a continued commitment to R&D is essential to maintain product leadership with our existing products as well as to provide innovative new product offerings.
Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A)
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
SMG&A expenses $ 1,273,584 $ 1,266,175 $ 7,409 1 %
SMG&A expenses as a % of revenue 10 % 11 %
SMG&A expenses increased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of higher employee related salary and benefit expenses and discretionary spending, partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses and acquisition-related transaction costs.
Amortization of Intangibles
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Amortization expenses $ 959,618 $ 1,012,572 $ (52,954) (5) %
Amortization expenses as a % of revenue 8 % 8 %
Amortization expenses decreased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of a portion of our acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2023.
Special Charges, Net
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Special charges, net $ 160,710 $ 274,509 $ (113,799) (41) %
Special charges, net as a % of revenue 1 % 2 %
Special charges, net decreased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to increased charges recorded in fiscal 2022 related to our Global Repositioning Actions offset by $160.7 million of charges recorded in fiscal 2023 primarily related to $114.0 million recorded for our plan committed to during the three months ended October 28, 2023, to reorganize our business (the Q4 2023 Plan). The Q4 2023 Plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force, and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust our cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in our end markets, as well as make certain strategic shifts in our workforce necessary to achieve our long-term vision. See Note 5, Special Charges, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Operating Income
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Operating income $ 3,823,112 $ 3,278,700 $ 544,412 17 %
Operating income as a % of revenue 31.1 % 27.3 %
The increase in operating income in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of a $344.7 million increase in gross margin, a $113.8 million decrease in special charges, net, a $53.0 million decrease in amortization expenses and a $40.3 million decrease in R&D expenses, partially offset by a $7.4 million increase in SMG&A expenses, as more fully described above under the headings Gross Margin, Special Charges, Net, Amortization of Intangibles, Research and Development (R&D) and Selling, Marketing, General and Administrative (SMG&A).
Nonoperating Expense (Income)
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Nonoperating expense (income)
$ 215,109 $ 179,951 $ 35,158 20 %
The year-over-year increase in nonoperating expense in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of
higher interest expense related to our debt obligations and lower net gains from other investments, partially offset by higher interest income.
Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 293,424 $ 350,188 $ (56,764) (16) %
Effective income tax rate 8.1 % 11.3 %
Our effective tax rates for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were below the U.S. statutory rate of 21% due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 our pretax income was primarily generated in Ireland at a tax rate of 12.5%. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 also included the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses which began in fiscal 2023 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The mandatory capitalization requirement decreased our effective tax rate primarily by increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was also impacted by a discrete income tax benefit recorded of $81.7 million resulting from the approval granted by the Joint Committee on Taxation of our federal corporate income tax relief claim which reduced the amount of transition tax owed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Net Income
Fiscal Year 2023 over 2022
2023 2022 $ Change % Change
Net income $ 3,314,579 $ 2,748,561 $ 566,018 21 %
Net income, as a % of revenue 26.9 % 22.9 %
Diluted EPS $ 6.55 $ 5.25 $ 1.30 25 %
The increase in net income in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was a result of a $544.4 million increase in operating income and a $56.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes, partially offset by a $35.2 million increase in nonoperating expense, as more fully described above under the headings Operating Income, Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes and Nonoperating (Income) Expense.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At October 28, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was $958.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $201.1 million was held in the United States and the balance of our cash and cash equivalents was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. We do not expect current regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material adverse effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, including money market funds. We maintain these balances with counterparties with high credit ratings, and continually monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversify our investments in order to minimize our credit risk.
We believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing, will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and dividend payments (if any) in the immediate future and for at least the next twelve months.

The following changes contributed to the net change in cash and cash equivalents from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023.
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily a result of higher net income adjusted for noncash items offset by changes in working capital.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows generally consist of capital expenditures and cash used for acquisitions. The increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of an increase in cash used for capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows generally consist of payments of dividends to shareholders, repurchases of common stock, issuance and repayment of debt and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock pursuant to employee equity incentive plans. The decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes during fiscal 2023 and lower debt repayments, partially offset by higher common stock repurchases.

_______________________________________
(1)We use the average of the current year and prior year ending net accounts receivable and ending inventory balance in our calculation of days sales outstanding and days cost of sales in inventory, respectively. Cost of sales amounts used in the calculation of days cost of sales in inventory include accounting adjustments related to amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired and depreciation related to the write-up of fixed assets to fair value as a result of the acquisition of Maxim.
The decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily the result of variations in the timing of collections and billings and decreased revenue levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.
Inventory increased in fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, primarily as a result of our efforts to balance manufacturing production, demand and inventory levels. Our inventory levels are impacted by our need to support forecasted sales demand and variations between those forecasts and actual demand.
Current liabilities increased to $3.2 billion at October 28, 2023 from $2.4 billion recorded at the end of fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in commercial paper notes and current debt, partially offset by lower accrued liabilities.
Revolving Credit Facility
Our Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2021, with Bank of America N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders, which was subsequently amended on December 20, 2022 and July 24, 2023 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement) provides for a five year unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions).
We may borrow under this revolving credit facility in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes. The terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on our ability to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement contains a consolidated leverage ratio covenant of total consolidated funded debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. As of October 28, 2023, we were in compliance with these covenants. See Note 13, Revolving Credit Facility, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revolving credit facility.
Debt
As of October 28, 2023, we had approximately $6.4 billion of carrying value outstanding on our senior notes. The difference in the carrying value of the debt and the principal is due to the unamortized discount and issuance fees and other adjustments on these instruments. The indentures governing certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that may limit our ability to: incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt or borrowed money secured by a lien upon a principal property; enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to a principal property; and consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all of our assets to, any other party. As of October 28, 2023, we were compliant with these covenants. See Note 14, Debt of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our outstanding debt.
Commercial Paper Program
During fiscal 2023, we established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes in amounts up to a maximum aggregate face amount of $2.5 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issuance. As of October 28, 2023, we had $547.2 million of outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We intend to use the net proceeds of the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including without limitation, repayment of indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital.
Stock Repurchase Program
Our common stock repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. Since inception, our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase $16.7 billion of our common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. Under the program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program.
As of October 28, 2023, $2.1 billion remained available for repurchase under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We also repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon our financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity and other factors we deem relevant.
Capital Expenditures
Net additions to property, plant and equipment were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2023 as we invested to enhance our global resiliency. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be between approximately $600.0 million and $800.0 million. These capital expenditures will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations, together with existing and anticipated available short- and long-term financing.
Dividends
On November 20, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.86 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on December 14, 2023 to all shareholders of record at the close of business on December 4, 2023 and is expected to total approximately $426.8 million. We currently expect quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by our Board of Directors. The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including our financial performance, outlook and liquidity.

(1)Debt obligations are assumed to be held to maturity.
(2)Tax obligation relates to the one-time tax on deemed repatriated earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and includes a reduction resulting from the approval granted by the Joint Committee on Taxation of our federal corporate income tax relief claim which reduced the amount of transition tax owed.
(3)Certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses. These escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table.
(4)We have supplier commitments for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities.
As of October 28, 2023, our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions was $186.2 million, which are included in non-current income taxes payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non-current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions. Therefore, we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table.
New Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, management believes that the impact of recently issued standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2s, New Accounting Pronouncements, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and impact on our historical financial condition and results of operations.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information. We consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment. If actual results differ significantly from managements estimates and projections, there could be a material effect on our financial statements. We also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies; however, the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective.
Revenue Recognition
Recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) we have entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of our shipping terms permit us to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, we defer the revenue recognized until title and control of the promised goods have passed to the customer. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
Performance Obligations: Substantially all of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues.
Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that we will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. The vast majority of such consideration are credits issued to the distributor due to price protection, but also include sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on management's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates.
Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents our unconditional right to receive consideration from our customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.
Inventory Valuation
We value inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, changes in inventory levels, obsolescence of technology, and product life cycles, we write down inventories to net realizable value. We employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory. While a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value calculations, an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory. If actual demand for our products is less than our estimates, additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods. To date, our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates.
Long-Lived Assets
We review property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. Material impairment adjustments related to our property, plant, and equipment are reflected in our financial statements for the periods presented. Any deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods.
Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows. Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets. These differences could
result in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in certain instances, assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased. In these situations, we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which we determined is consistent with our identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about July 30) or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist or we reorganize our operating segments or reporting units.
We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, we consider several factors, including the following:
-the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to their previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-the current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in our competitors' businesses;
-changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of our reporting units;
-changes in our market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of our reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower our prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
If we elect not to use this option, or we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, we consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. We determine the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow methodology which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates, and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, we use the guideline public company method. Under this method we utilize information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain their respective fair values. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values, we reconcile the aggregate fair values of our reporting units determined, as described above, to our total company market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
In fiscal 2023, we used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for our reporting units. In fiscal 2022, we used a combination of the qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing goodwill for all reporting units. In all periods presented, we concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.
Business Combinations
Under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We record the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the value of the net assets acquired as goodwill. The accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations. Critical estimates in valuing purchased technology, customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could experience impairment charges which could be material. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired
assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.
We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. We generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the income approach methodology of valuation. Each reporting period thereafter, we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates, and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined milestones. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and record a corresponding valuation allowance as necessary if we determine those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching our conclusion, we evaluate certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to our income tax provision in future periods.
We account for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the financial statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to our income tax provision, which could materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event our assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, our current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes during the year in enacted tax law could affect these estimates.
See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense associated with stock related awards is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Determining the amount of stock-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units and market-based and performance-based awards. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions is calculated using the value of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting. For restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability
of achievement of that performance condition. If we determine that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.
The use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of key assumptions which are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends. We recognize the expense related to equity awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. See Note 2r, Stock-Based Compensation, and Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to stock-based compensation.
Contingencies
From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against us arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. We periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, we may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. Based on the information we obtain, combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter, we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, we record a contingent loss. In determining the amount of a contingent loss, we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter, current status of legal proceedings, settlement negotiations that may be ongoing, prior case history and other factors. If the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect, we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Exposure
Our interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. In this regard, changes in interest rates affect the interest earned or paid on our marketable securities and debt, as well as the fair value of our investments and debt.
Based on our floating rate debt outstanding as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, inclusive of our commercial paper notes and interest rate swap outstanding, as applicable, our annual interest expense would change by approximately $20.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
Based on our cash and marketable securities outstanding as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, our annual interest income would change by approximately $9.6 million and $14.7 million, respectively, for each 100 basis point increase in interest rates.
To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period. If significant, such losses would only be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity.
As of October 28, 2023 we had $1.0 billion notional of fixed for floating interest rate swaps outstanding, with the swap payable having a fair value of $81.6 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase the swap payable by approximately $57.0 million with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt.
As of October 28, 2023, we had $6.5 billion in principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding, with a fair value of $5.3 billion. We also had $547.2 million of commercial paper notes outstanding. As commercial paper notes issuances are at then-current rates and with very short maturities, the carrying value will approximate the fair value. The fair value of our notes is subject to interest rate risk, market risk and other factors. Generally, the fair value of our notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. The fair values of our notes as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, assuming a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates, are as follows:
October 28, 2023 October 29, 2022
(thousands) Principal Amount Outstanding Fair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points Principal Amount Outstanding Fair Value Fair Value given an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points

Years ended October 28, 2023, October 29, 2022 and October 30, 2021
(all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts)
1.Description of Business
Analog Devices, Inc. (Analog Devices or the Company) is a global semiconductor leader dedicated to solving its customers' most complex engineering challenges. Since its inception in 1965, the Company has played a critical role at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds by providing the building blocks to sense, measure, interpret, connect and power. The Company designs, manufactures, tests and markets a broad portfolio of solutions, including integrated circuits (ICs), software and subsystems that leverage high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing technologies. The Company's comprehensive product portfolio, deep domain expertise and advanced manufacturing capabilities extend across high-performance precision and high-speed mixed-signal, power management and processing technologies - including data converters, amplifiers, power management, radio frequency ICs, edge processors and other sensors. The Company's focus is largely on the business-to-business end markets of Industrial, Automotive and Communications and related applications, as well as Consumer applications, with the goal of driving sustainable and profitable growth over the long term.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a.Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023 (fiscal 2023). Such reclassified amounts are immaterial.
The Companys fiscal year is the 52-week or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day in October. Fiscal 2023, the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022 (fiscal 2022) and the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021 (fiscal 2021) were 52-week fiscal periods.
On August 26, 2021 (Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 12, 2020 (the Merger Agreement), Maxim stockholders received, for each outstanding share of Maxim common stock, 0.6300 of a share of the Companys common stock as of the Acquisition Date for total consideration of approximately $28.0 billion of the Company's common stock. The acquisition of Maxim is referred to as the Acquisition. The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include the financial results of Maxim prospectively from the Acquisition Date. See Note 6, Acquisitions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
b.Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of ninety days or less at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of government and institutional money market funds, corporate obligations such as commercial paper and floating rate notes, bonds, demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, and bank time deposits.
The Company classifies its investments in readily marketable debt and equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading at the time of purchase. There were no transfers between investment classifications in any of the fiscal years presented. Held-to-maturity securities, which are carried at amortized cost, include only those securities the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Securities such as bank time deposits, which by their nature are typically held to maturity, are classified as such. The Companys other readily marketable cash equivalents are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with any material unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (AOCI). Adjustments to the fair value of investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an increase or decrease in AOCI, unless the adjustment is considered an other-than-temporary impairment, in which case the adjustment is recorded as a charge in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company reviews available-for-sale securities for impairment whenever the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost. There were no impairments of investments in any of the fiscal years presented.
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
Realized gains or losses on investments are determined based on the specific identification basis and are recognized in nonoperating (income) expense. There were no material net realized gains or losses from the sales of available-for-sale investments during any of the fiscal periods presented.
The components of the Companys cash and cash equivalents as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were as follows:
2023 2022
Cash $ 642,081 $ 1,016,027
Available-for-sale securities 315,980 454,545
Total cash and cash equivalents $ 958,061 $ 1,470,572
See Note 2j, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Companys cash equivalents.
c.Supplemental Cash Flow Statement Information
2023 2022 2021
Cash paid during the fiscal year for:
Income taxes $ 987,225 $ 821,683 $ 388,115
Interest $ 206,415 $ 172,957 $ 197,841
Noncash issuance of common stock for the Acquisition $ - $ - $ 27,754,161
Fair value of partially vested equity replacement awards issued for the Acquisition
$ - $ - $ 194,890
d.Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The valuation of inventory requires the Company to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. The Company employs a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of its inventory. While a portion of the calculation to record inventory at its net realizable value is based on the age of the inventory and lower of cost or net realizable value calculations, a key factor in estimating obsolete or excess inventory requires the Company to estimate the future demand for its products. If actual demand is less than the Companys estimates, impairment charges, which are recorded to cost of sales, may need to be recorded in future periods. Inventory in excess of saleable amounts is not valued, and the remaining inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
Inventories at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were as follows:
2023 2022
Raw materials $ 128,142 $ 110,908
Work in process 1,125,819 904,648
Finished goods 388,253 384,358
Total inventories $ 1,642,214 $ 1,399,914
e.Property, Plant and Equipment
The following table presents details of the Company's property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net of accumulated depreciation:
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
2023 2022 (1)
Land and buildings $ 1,715,572 $ 1,459,981
Machinery and equipment 4,377,921 3,648,256
Office equipment 373,126 322,414
Leasehold improvements 177,313 118,856
6,643,932 5,549,507
Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 3,424,775 3,148,203
Net property, plant and equipment $ 3,219,157 $ 2,401,304
_________________________________
(1) Certain amounts previously reported between machinery and equipment and office equipment have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for fiscal 2023.
PP&E is recorded at cost, less allowances for depreciation and amortization. The straight-line method of depreciation is used for all classes of assets for financial statement purposes while both straight-line and accelerated methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance charges are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is based on the following ranges of estimated useful lives:
Buildings Up to 30 years
Machinery & equipment 4-10 years
Office equipment 2-10 years
Leasehold improvements 5-20 years
The Company reviews PP&E for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique. If such assets are not impaired, but their useful lives have decreased, the remaining net book value is depreciated over the revised useful life.
PP&E is identified as held for sale when it meets the held for sale criteria of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). Depreciation is not recorded for assets that are classified as held for sale. When an asset meets the held for sale criteria, the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell is reclassified from the relevant PP&E line items and into current assets on the balance sheet, where it remains until it is either sold or it no longer meets the held for sale criteria. If the assets held for sale were carried at fair value, it would be considered a Level 3 fair value measurement, and determined based on the use of appraisals and input from market participants.
During fiscal 2023, the Company ceased usage of its campus facility located in Milpitas, California and determined that the facility met the held for sale criteria specified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360. No write-downs to fair value were required upon this determination as the fair value of the asset group, less costs to sell, was greater than the carrying value. As of October 28, 2023, prepaid expenses and other current assets includes the following assets held for sale:
Land and buildings $ 61,724
Less accumulated depreciation and amortization (20,604)
Net property, plant and equipment reclassified to Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 41,120
f.Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable, utilizing either the qualitative or quantitative method. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which the Company has determined is consistent with its identified operating segments, on an annual basis on the first day of the fourth quarter (on or about July 30) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or the Company reorganizes its operating segments or reporting units.
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value. When using the qualitative method, the Company considers several factors, including the following:
-the amount by which the fair values of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis, which indicated there would need to be substantial negative developments in the markets in which these reporting units operate in order for there to be potential impairment;
-the carrying values of these reporting units as of the assessment date compared to the previously calculated fair values as of the date of the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-the Company's current forecasts as compared to the forecasts included in the most recent quantitative impairment analysis;
-public information from competitors and other industry information to determine if there were any significant adverse trends in the Company's competitors' businesses;
-changes in the value of major U.S. stock indices that could suggest declines in overall market stability that could impact the valuation of the Company's reporting units;
-changes in the Company's market capitalization and overall enterprise valuation to determine if there were any significant decreases that could be an indication that the valuation of its reporting units had significantly decreased; and
-whether there had been any significant increases to the weighted-average cost of capital rates for each reporting unit, which could materially lower the Company's prior valuation conclusions under a discounted cash flow approach.
If the Company elects not to use this option, or it determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its net book value, then the Company performs the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the amount of the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Additionally, the Company considers income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. Management determines the fair values of the reporting units using a weighting of the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, it uses a discounted cash flow methodology, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenues, gross profit margins, operating income margins, working capital cash flow, perpetual growth rates and long-term discount rates, among others. For the market approach, it uses the guideline public company method. Under this method management utilizes information from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting units, to create valuation multiples that are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested, in order to obtain its respective fair value. In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated values, the aggregate fair values of the reporting units are reconciled to the Company's total market capitalization, allowing for a reasonable control premium.
In fiscal 2023, the Company used the qualitative method of assessing goodwill for the Company's reporting units. In fiscal 2022, the Company used a combination of the qualitative and quantitative methods of assessing goodwill for the Company's reporting units. In all periods presented, management concluded the reporting units' fair values exceeded their carrying amounts as of the assessment dates and no risk of impairment existed.
The Companys next annual impairment assessment will be performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ending November 2, 2024 (fiscal 2024) unless indicators arise that would require the Company to reevaluate at an earlier date.
The following table presents the changes in goodwill during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022:
2023 2022
Balance at beginning of year $ 26,913,134 $ 26,918,470

Intangible Assets
The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. If required, recoverability of these assets is determined by comparison of their carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.
In-process research and development (IPR&D) assets are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development (R&D) efforts. Upon completion of the projects, the IPR&D assets are reclassified to technology-based intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.
As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the Companys intangible assets consisted of the following:
October 28, 2023 October 29, 2022

(1) In fiscal 2022 foreign intangible asset carrying amounts were affected by foreign currency translation.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $2.0 billion, $2.0 billion and $843.4 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in cost of sales and amortization of intangibles on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining amortization expense will be recognized over the remaining weighted average life of approximately 4.2 years.
The Company expects annual amortization expense for intangible assets as follows:
Fiscal Year Amortization Expense
2024 $ 1,739,964
2025 $ 1,579,260
2026 $ 1,529,468
2027 $ 1,526,093
2028 $ 1,462,929
g.Grant Accounting
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have received grants from governmental agencies. These grants include capital, employment and research and development grants. Capital grants for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment are netted against the related capital expenditures and amortized as a credit to depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Employment grants, which relate to employee hiring and training, and research and development grants are recognized in earnings in the period in which the related expenditures are incurred by the Company.
In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 (CHIPS Act), which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments and establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the Company recognized $174.3 million and $16.6 million, respectively, in other assets with a corresponding reduction to the carrying amounts of the qualifying manufacturing assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

h.Translation of Foreign Currencies
Generally, the functional currency of the Companys foreign operations is the U.S. dollar. In certain entities where that is not the case, gains and losses resulting from translation of the foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are recorded in AOCI. Transaction gains and losses and re-measurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are included in income currently, including those at the Companys principal foreign manufacturing operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
i.Derivative Instruments and Hedging Agreements
Foreign Exchange Exposure Management - The Company enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to offset certain operational and balance sheet exposures from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from the portion of the Companys operations, assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro; other significant exposures include the British Pound, Philippine Peso, Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit and the Japanese Yen. Derivative instruments are employed to eliminate or minimize certain foreign currency exposures that can be confidently identified and quantified. These foreign currency exchange contracts are entered into to support transactions made in the normal course of business, and accordingly, are not speculative in nature. The contracts are for periods consistent with the terms of the underlying transactions, generally one year or less. Hedges related to anticipated transactions are matched with the underlying exposures at inception and designated and documented as cash flow hedges. They are qualitatively evaluated for effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The gain or loss on the derivatives are reported as a component of AOCI in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedged transaction in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
The total notional amounts of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments of cash flow hedges as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 was $322.6 million and $307.1 million, respectively. The fair values of forward foreign currency derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were as follows:
Fair Value At
Balance Sheet Location October 28, 2023 October 29, 2022
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts Accrued liabilities $ 9,426 $ 18,050
Additionally, the Company enters into forward foreign currency contracts that economically hedge the gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of certain recorded assets and liabilities in a non-functional currency. Changes in the fair value of these undesignated hedges are recognized in other (income) expense immediately as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the asset or liability being hedged. As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the total notional amounts of undesignated hedges related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts were $334.7 million and $246.4 million, respectively.
All of the Companys derivative financial instruments are eligible for netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, none of the netting arrangements involved collateral.
As of October 28, 2023, none of the Company's forward foreign currency exchange contracts were netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table presents the gross amounts of the Company's forward foreign currency exchange contracts and the net amounts recorded in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 29, 2022:
October 29, 2022
Gross amount of recognized liabilities $ (19,846)
Gross amounts of recognized assets 2,862
Net liabilities offset and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets $ (16,984)
Interest Rate Exposure Management - The Company's current and future debt may be subject to interest rate risk. The Company utilizes interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce the effects of changes in interest rates. During fiscal 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which locked in the interest rate for up to $1 billion in future debt issuances. The interest rate swap was designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge. During fiscal 2021, the Company issued $1 billion of 2.100% Senior Notes due October 2031, and the swap was cash terminated in the amount of $153.2 million. During fiscal 2023, the Company entered into interest rate swap transactions related to its outstanding $1,000.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.1% senior unsecured notes (the 2031 Notes) where the Company swapped the notional amount of its $1,000.0 million of fixed rate debt at 2.1% into floating interest rate debt through April 1,
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
2031. The fair value of the swaps at inception was zero and subsequent changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were reflected in the carrying value of the interest rate swaps on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet was adjusted by an equal and offsetting amount. The interest rate swaps were designated and qualified as fair value hedges. The Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant. The gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged benchmark interest rate risk and the offsetting gain or loss on the related interest rate swaps were recorded as follows:
October 28, 2023
Balance Sheet Location Loss on Swaps Gain on Note
Accrued liabilities $ 81,602 $ -
Long-term debt
$ - $ 81,602
The market risk associated with the Companys derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions, assets and liabilities being hedged. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Companys derivative instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings. Based on the credit ratings of the Companys counterparties as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, nonperformance is not perceived to be a material risk. Furthermore, none of the Companys derivatives are subject to collateral or other security arrangements and none contain provisions that are dependent on the Companys credit ratings from any credit rating agency. While the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions, they do not represent the amount of the Companys exposure to credit risk. The amounts potentially subject to credit risk (arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed the obligations of the Company to the counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant.
The Company records the fair value of its derivative financial instruments in its Consolidated Financial Statements in other current assets, other assets, accrued liabilities, other non-current liabilities and long-term debt, depending on their net position, regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the derivative contract. Changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and reclassified into earnings in the same line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income as the impact of the hedged transaction when the underlying contract matures. Changes in the fair value of designated fair value hedges are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a swap asset or an accrued liability with an offsetting increment/decrement to the long-term debt balance, which is the underlying item being hedged. Changes in the fair values of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are reported in earnings as they occur.
For information on the unrealized holding gains (losses) on derivatives included in and reclassified out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Income related to forward foreign currency exchange contracts, see Note 2o, Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
j.Fair Value
The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).
Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.
The tables below, set forth by level, presents the Companys financial assets and liabilities, excluding accrued interest components, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022. The tables exclude cash on hand and assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. As of

ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
Cash equivalents - These investments are adjusted to fair value based on quoted market prices or are determined using a yield curve model based on current market rates.
Deferred compensation plan investments - The fair value of these mutual fund, money market fund and equity investments are based on quoted market prices.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts - The estimated fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which includes derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges and those that are not designated as cash flow hedges, is based on the estimated amount the Company would receive if it sold these agreements at the reporting date taking into consideration current exchange rates as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and the Companys creditworthiness for liabilities. The fair value of these instruments is based upon valuation models using current market information such as strike price, spot rate, forward points, and maturity date.
Interest rate derivative - The fair value of interest rate derivatives is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the contractual terms of the derivatives.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Santa Clara, California leased property asset group - As a result of a sublease transaction involving a leased property in Santa Clara, California during fiscal 2022, the Company estimated the fair value of the sublease assets using discounted cash flows from the estimated net sublease rental income discounted at a market rate and recorded an impairment charge which represented the excess carrying value of the asset group associated with the Santa Clara, California leased property over its estimated fair value. These assets are considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note 5, Special Charges, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Held for sale assets - The Company has classified the assets held for sale at carrying value. However, if they were to be carried at fair value, they would be considered a Level 3 fair value measurement and would be determined based on the use of appraisals and input from market participants.
Commercial paper notes - The fair values of commercial paper notes are obtained from indicative market prices and are classified as Level 2 measurements according to the fair value hierarchy. As of October 28, 2023, the fair value of the commercial paper notes was $547.2 million.
Debt - The table below presents the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As commercial paper issuances are at then current rates and with very short maturities, the carrying value will approximate fair value. The fair values of the senior unsecured notes are obtained from broker prices and are classified as Level 1 measurements according to the fair value hierarchy. See Note 14, Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion related to outstanding debt.

k.Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates relate to the useful lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts and customer returns; the net realizable value of inventory; potential reserves relating to litigation matters; accrued liabilities, including estimates of variable consideration related to distributor sales; accrued taxes; uncertain tax positions; deferred tax valuation allowances; assumptions pertaining to stock-based compensation payments and defined benefit plans; and fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including inventory, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and acquired intangibles; and other reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
l.Concentrations of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments and trade accounts receivable.
The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality counterparties, continuously monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversifies its investments in order to minimize its credit risk.
The Company sells its products to distributors and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) involved in a variety of industries including industrial, communications, automotive and consumer end markets. The Company has adopted credit policies and standards to accommodate growth in these markets. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and although the Company generally does not require collateral, the Company may require letters of credit from customers in certain circumstances. The Company provides reserves for estimated amounts of accounts receivable that may not be collected.
The Company's largest customer, which is a distributor rather than an end customer, accounted for approximately 25%, 22%, and 26% of net revenues in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The Company's next largest customer, which is also a distributor, accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 11% of net revenues in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of revenue in any period presented.
m.Concentration of Other Risks
The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change, competitive pricing pressures and cyclical market patterns. The Companys financial results are affected by a wide variety of factors, including general economic conditions worldwide, economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricators and independent distributors. In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns at various times. The Company is exposed to the risk of obsolescence of its inventory depending on the mix of future business. Additionally, more than half of the Companys purchases of external wafer and foundry services are from a limited number of suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others. If these suppliers or any of the Companys other key suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components, on the time schedule and of the quality that the Company requires, the Company may be forced to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in significant expenses and disruptions or delays in manufacturing, product development and shipment of product to the Companys customers.
n.Revenue Recognition
Recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the providing entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: (1) the Company has entered into a binding agreement, (2) the performance obligations have been identified, (3) the transaction price to the customer has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been allocated to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) the performance obligations have been satisfied. The majority of the Company's shipping terms permit the Company to recognize revenue at point of shipment or delivery. Certain shipping terms require the goods to be through customs or be received by the customer before title passes. In those instances, the Company defers the revenue recognized until title and control of the promised goods have passed to the customer. Shipping costs are charged to selling, marketing, general and administrative expense as incurred. Sales taxes are excluded from revenue.
Revenue from contracts with the United States government, government prime contractors and certain commercial customers is recorded over time using either units delivered or costs incurred as the measurement basis for progress toward completion. These measures are used to measure results directly and is generally the best measure of progress toward completion in circumstances in which a reliable measure of output can be established. Estimated revenue in excess of amounts billed is reported as unbilled receivables. Contract accounting requires judgment in estimating costs and assumptions related to technical issues and delivery schedule. Contract costs include material, subcontract costs, labor and an allocation of indirect costs. The estimation of costs at completion of a contract is subject to numerous variables involving contract costs and estimates as to the length of time to complete the contract. Changes in contract performance, estimated gross margin, including the impact of final contract settlements, and estimated losses are recognized in the period in which the changes or losses are determined.
Performance Obligations: Substantially all of the Companys contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, the sale of mixed-signal integrated circuit products. Such sales represent a single performance obligation because the sale is one type of good or includes multiple goods that are neither capable of being distinct nor separable from the other promises in the contract. This performance obligation is satisfied when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which occurs upon shipment or delivery. Unsatisfied performance obligations primarily represent contracts for products with future delivery dates and with an original expected duration of one year or less. The Company generally offers a twelve-month warranty for its products. The Companys warranty policy provides for replacement of defective products. Specific accruals are recorded for known product warranty issues. Product warranty expenses during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 were not material.
Transaction Price: The transaction price reflects the Companys expectations about the consideration it will be entitled to receive from the customer and may include fixed or variable amounts. Fixed consideration primarily includes sales to direct customers and sales to distributors in which both the sale to the distributor and the sale to the end customer occur within the same reporting period. Variable consideration includes sales in which the amount of consideration that the Company will receive is unknown as of the end of a reporting period. The vast majority of such consideration are credits issued to the distributor due to price protection, but also include sales made to distributors under agreements that allow certain rights of return, referred to as stock rotation. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors to allow the distributor to earn an appropriate margin on sales negotiated with certain customers and in the event of a price decrease subsequent to the date the product was shipped and billed to the distributor. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns in order to reduce the amounts of slow-moving, discontinued or obsolete product from their inventory. A liability for distributor credits covering variable consideration is made based on the Company's estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economic conditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions the Company has made based on its historical estimates. For fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, sales to distributors were approximately $7.5 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, net of variable consideration for which the liability
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
balances as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 were $525.4 million and $749.4 million, respectively, and were recorded in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract Balances: Accounts receivable represents the Companys unconditional right to receive consideration from its customers. Payments are typically due within 30 to 45 days of invoicing and do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material credit losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in any of the periods presented.
o.Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income
AOCI includes certain transactions that have generally been reported in the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity. The changes in components of AOCI at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 consisted of the following:

p.Income Taxes
The Company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income tax credits, benefits, and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of certain expenses for tax and financial statement purposes. The likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a corresponding valuation allowance is recorded as necessary if management determines those deferred tax assets may not be realized due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount to be realized of certain state and international tax credit carryovers. In reaching this conclusion, the Company evaluates certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state and international jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years. Judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions, changes in U.S. or international tax laws and other factors. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets, which may result in an increase or decrease to the income tax provision in future periods.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by first determining if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities prior to recording any benefit in the Consolidated Financial Statements. An uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Management classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. Management reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in known facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new guidance on legislative interpretations. A change in these factors could result in the recognition of an increase or decrease to the Company's income tax provision which could materially impact its consolidated financial position and results of operations.
In the ordinary course of global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities. Although the Company believes its estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and income tax liabilities. In the event management's assumptions are incorrect, the differences could have a material impact on its income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. In addition to the factors described above, the current and expected effective tax rate is based on then-current tax law. Significant changes in enacted tax law could affect these estimates. See Note 12, Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to income taxes.
q.Earnings Per Share of Common Stock
Basic earnings per share is computed based only on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of potential future issuances of common stock relating to stock option programs and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units is computed using the average market price for the respective period. In addition, the assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method include the average unrecognized compensation expense of stock options that are in-the-money and restricted stock units. This results in the assumed buyback of additional shares, thereby reducing the dilutive impact of in-the-money stock options. Potential shares related to certain of the Companys outstanding stock options and restricted stock units were excluded because they were anti-dilutive. Those potential shares, determined based on the weighted average exercise prices during the respective periods, could be dilutive in the future.
In connection with the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporate (Linear), the Company granted restricted stock awards to replace outstanding restricted stock awards of Linear employees. These restricted stock awards entitle recipients to voting and nonforfeitable dividend rights from the date of grant. These unvested stock-based compensation awards are considered participating securities and the two-class method is used for purposes of calculating earnings per share. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and therefore is excluded from the calculation of earnings per share allocated to common stock. The difference between the income allocated to participating securities under the basic and diluted two-class methods is not material.

(1)For all fiscal years presented, income allocated to participating securities, if any, is not material.
r.Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the grant-date fair value of the awards ultimately expected to vest and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and restricted stock units, or in annual installments of 25% on each of the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Restricted stock units with service and performance or market conditions generally vest in one installment on the third anniversary of the date of grant. For grants issued prior to fiscal 2018, the vesting period was generally five years for stock options, or in annual installments of 20% on each of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant and in one installment on the third anniversary of the date of grant for restricted stock units/awards. The maximum contractual term of all stock options is ten years.
Determining the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recorded requires the Company to develop estimates used in calculating the grant-date fair value of awards. These estimates may be based on different valuation models depending upon the type of award and may include assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield, forfeiture rate and others. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. The grant-date fair value of restricted stock units with a service condition and restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions is calculated using the value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on the Company's common stock prior to vesting. For restricted stock units with both service and performance conditions, this grant-date fair value is also impacted by the number of units that are expected to vest during the performance period and is adjusted through the related stock-based compensation expense at each reporting period based on the probability of achievement of that performance condition. If the Company determines that an award is unlikely to vest, any previously recorded stock-based compensation expense is reversed in the period of that determination. The grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance-based stock options with both service and market conditions is calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance condition stipulated in the award grant, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied.
The fair value of shares to be issued under the Company's employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is computed using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in June and December of each year and the related expense is recorded over the offering period.
See Note 3, Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders' Equity, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to stock-based compensation.

s.New Accounting Pronouncements
Standards to Be Implemented
Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Acquired Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities. Under the new guidance (ASC 805-20-30-28), the acquirer should determine what contract assets and/or contract liabilities it would have recorded under ASC 606 (the revenue guidance) as of the acquisition date, as if the acquirer had entered into the original contract at the same date and on the same terms as the acquiree. The recognition and measurement of those contract assets and contract liabilities will likely be comparable to what the acquiree has recorded on its books under ASC 606 as of the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and apply to any future business combinations.
3. Stock-Based Compensation and Shareholders Equity
Equity Compensation Plans
The Company grants, or has granted, stock options and other stock and stock-based awards under the Company's 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (2020 Plan), which was approved by shareholders in March 2020. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of up to 21.2 million shares of the Companys common stock, which includes shares under the Companys previous equity compensation plans, including the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The 2020 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. Employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to be granted awards under the 2020 Plan. No award may be made under the 2020 Plan after March 11, 2030, but awards previously granted may extend beyond that date. The Company does not intend to grant further equity awards under any previous legacy equity compensation plans. In connection with the Acquisition, the Company assumed the Maxim 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (1996 Plan) and may grant stock options and other stock and stock-based awards under the 1996 Plan. As of October 28, 2023, a total of 15.1 million common shares were available for future grant under the 2020 Plan and 8.5 million common shares were available for future grant under the 1996 Plan.
Maxim Replacement Awards
In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued equity awards, consisting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units (replacement awards), to certain Maxim employees in replacement of Maxim equity awards. The replacement awards consist of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for approximately 3.7 million shares of the Company's common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of $161.63. The terms and intrinsic value of these replacement awards are substantially the same as the converted Maxim awards. The fair value of the replacement awards associated with services rendered through the Acquisition Date was recognized as a component of the total acquisition consideration, and the remaining fair value of the replacement awards associated with post-Acquisition services will be recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period.
Modification of Awards
The Company has, from time to time, modified the terms of its equity awards to employees and directors. The modifications made to the Companys equity awards in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 did not result in significant incremental compensation costs, either individually or in the aggregate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
Grant-Date Fair Value of Stock Options
Information pertaining to the Companys stock option awards and the related estimated weighted-average assumptions to calculate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model granted in fiscal 2021 is below. The Company did not grant stock option awards in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.
Options granted (in thousands) 644
Weighted-average exercise price $145.04
Weighted-average grant-date fair value $33.35
Assumptions:
Weighted-average expected volatility 35.3 %
Weighted-average expected term (in years) 5.0
Weighted-average risk-free interest rate 0.8 %
Weighted-average expected dividend yield 1.9 %
Expected volatility - The Company is responsible for estimating volatility and has considered a number of factors, including third-party estimates. The Company currently believes that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant-date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the markets current expectations of future volatility. In evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility, the Company concluded that: (1) options in the Companys common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges; (2) the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options; (3) the traded options have exercise prices that are both near-the-money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options; and (4) the remaining maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year.
Expected term - The Company uses historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The Company believes that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option, and that generally its employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.
Risk-free interest rate - The yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk-free interest rate.
Expected dividend yield - Expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by the Companys Board of Directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant. Until such time as the Companys Board of Directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarters cash dividend, the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption. Cash dividends are not paid on options, restricted stock, replacement awards or restricted stock units. In connection with the acquisition of Linear, the Company granted restricted stock awards to replace outstanding restricted stock awards of Linear employees. These restricted stock awards specific to legacy Linear awards entitle recipients to voting and nonforfeitable dividend rights from the date of grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company offers an ESPP to eligible employees, providing the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. Offering periods begin in June and December each year. U.S. employees are allowed to purchase the Company's common stock at the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning or end of the offering period. Eligible employees outside of the U.S. are allowed to purchase the Company's common stock at the lesser of 80% of the fair market value of the common stock at either the beginning or end of the offering period. As of October 28, 2023, a total of 4.5 million shares of the Company's common stock were available for future grant under the ESPP.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. Based on an analysis of its historical forfeitures, the Company has applied an annual forfeiture rate of 5.0% to all unvested stock-based awards as of October 28, 2023. This analysis will be re-evaluated annually and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary. Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest.

Common Stock Repurchases
In fiscal 2021, the Company entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR) with third party financial institutions, paid $2.5 billion and received an initial delivery of 12.3 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. As of October 30, 2021, the Company recorded the remaining 20%, or $500.0 million, within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which was utilized during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the ASR was completed and an additional 2.1 million shares of common stock were received as final settlement of the ASR. In total, the Company repurchased 14.4 million shares of common stock under the ASR at an average price per share of $173.77.
The Companys share repurchase program has been in place since August 2004. In the aggregate, the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase $16.7 billion of the Companys common stock under the program, which includes the $8.5 billion authorization approved by the Board of Directors on August 25, 2021. The Company may repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of the Companys Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when the Company has repurchased all shares authorized under the program. As of October 28, 2023, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 205.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $14.5 billion under this program. An additional $2.1 billion remains available for repurchase of shares under the current authorized program. The repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Future repurchases of common stock will be dependent upon the Company's financial position, results of operations, outlook, liquidity, and other factors deemed relevant by the Company.
The Company also, from time to time, repurchases shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units/awards or the exercise of stock options. The withholding amount is based on the employee's minimum statutory withholding requirement. Any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including the Company's financial performance, outlook, liquidity and the amount of cash the Company has available in the United States.
Preferred Stock
The Company has 471,934 authorized shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock, none of which is issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors is authorized to fix designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations on the preferred stock at the time of issuance.
4. Industry, Segment and Geographic Information
The Company operates and tracks its results in one reportable segment based on the aggregation of its operating segments. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of integrated circuits (ICs). The Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Company has determined that all of the Company's operating segments share the following similar economic characteristics, and therefore meet the criteria established for operating segments to be aggregated into one reportable segment, namely:
The primary source of revenue for each operating segment is the sale of ICs.
The ICs sold by each of the Company's operating segments are manufactured using similar semiconductor manufacturing processes and raw materials in either the Companys own production facilities or by third-party wafer fabricators using proprietary processes.
The Company sells its products to tens of thousands of customers worldwide. Many of these customers use products spanning all operating segments in a wide range of applications.
The ICs marketed by each of the Company's operating segments are sold globally through a direct sales force, third-party distributors, independent sales representatives and via the Company's website to the same types of customers.
All of the Company's operating segments share a similar long-term financial model as they have similar economic characteristics. The causes for variation in operating and financial performance are the same among the Company's operating segments and include factors such as (i) life cycle and price and cost fluctuations, (ii) number of competitors, (iii) product differentiation and (iv) size of market opportunity. Additionally, each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. Lastly, the number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required for production of products are proportionally similar for each operating segment.
Revenue Trends by End Market
The following table summarizes revenue by end market. The categorization of revenue by end market is determined using

a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product, the sold to customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which the Companys product will be incorporated. As data systems for capturing and tracking this data and the Company's methodology evolves and improves, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, the Company reclassifies revenue by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within each end market.

Q4 2023 Plan
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company committed to a plan to reorganize its business (the Q4 2023 Plan). The Q4 2023 Plan, consisting of voluntary and involuntary reductions-in-force and other cost-savings initiatives, was commenced to adjust the Companys cost structure and business activities to better align with weaker market demand and continued economic uncertainty in its end markets, as well as to make certain strategic shifts in its workforce necessary to achieve its long-term vision. The reductions-in-force, which are subject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which the actions are planned, are expected to impact positions in manufacturing, engineering and selling, marketing, general and administrative functions. The Company recorded net special charges of $114.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 related to the Q4 2023 Plan. In connection with the Q4 2023 Plan, the Company expects to incur special charges, net of between $120.0 million and $140.0 million, primarily related to reductions-in-force. The Company expects that the majority of the actions under the Q4 2023 Plan will be completed by the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ending May 4, 2024. The Company expects to settle these charges with cash on hand, together with existing and anticipated available short-term financing.
Global Repositioning Actions
The Company recorded net special charges of $532.7 million on a cumulative basis through October 28, 2023, as part of the integration of the Acquisition and continued organizational initiatives to consolidate its global footprint related to certain manufacturing, engineering, sales, marketing and administrative offices and to better align its global workforce with the Company's long-term strategic plan. The special charges include severance and fringe benefit costs, in accordance with the Company's ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations, and the write-off of acquired intellectual property due to the Company's decision to discontinue certain product development strategies.
In connection with the Companys decision during fiscal 2022 to transition its engineering, sales, marketing and administrative activities from its leased property in Santa Clara, California to its owned property in San Jose, California, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for a portion of the leased property and intends to sublease the remainder of this property. As a result of the sublease transaction, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $91.9 million in net special charges which represented the excess carrying value of the associated asset group over its estimated fair value. The Company estimated fair value using cash flows from the estimated net sublease rental income discounted at a market rate. The Company allocated $60.6 million, $28.1 million and $3.2 million of the impairment charge to right of use assets, leasehold improvements and office equipment, respectively.

Closure of Manufacturing Facilities
The Company recorded net special charges of $63.8 million on a cumulative basis through October 28, 2023 as a result of its decision to consolidate certain wafer and test facility operations acquired as part of the acquisition of Linear. The net special charges included cumulative gains of $18.0 million related to net proceeds received of approximately $67.5 million for the sale of its Hillview wafer fabrication facility and certain equipment located in Milpitas, California as well as the sale of its facility and certain equipment in Singapore.
6. Acquisitions
Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.
On the Acquisition Date, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the voting interests of Maxim, an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. Under the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired Maxim (Merger Agreement), Maxim stockholders received, for each outstanding share of Maxim common stock, 0.6300 of a share of the Company's common stock at the closing. The Company believes the combination creates an expanded suite of top-performing mixed-signal and power management technology offerings and complements the Company's legacy offerings. The results of operations of Maxim from the Acquisition Date are included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Income, Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity for fiscal 2021. The amount of revenue attributable to Maxim included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2021 was $558.8 million. The amount of Maxim's earnings included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal 2021 is impracticable to calculate.
The Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration transferred in the Acquisition consisted of the following:
Cash consideration (a)
$ 47
Issuance of common stock (b)
27,754,161
Fair value of partially vested restricted stock and restricted stock unit replacement awards (c)
194,890
Total purchase consideration
$ 27,949,098
____________________
(a)This reflects the cash paid for fractional shares of the Companys common stock in respect of shares of Maxim common stock outstanding.
(b)The fair value is based on the issuance of approximately 169.2 million shares of the Company's common stock with a per share value of $164.00 on the Acquisition Date.
(c)In connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued equity awards, consisting of restricted stock and restricted stock units, to certain Maxim employees in replacement of Maxim equity awards that were cancelled at closing. The replacement awards consist of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards for approximately 3.7 million shares of the Company's common stock with a weighted average grant date fair value of $161.63. This amount represents the portion of the fair value of the replacement equity awards associated with services rendered through the Acquisition Date and has been included as a component of the total purchase consideration.
During fiscal 2022, the Company completed the acquisition accounting for the Acquisition. The following is a summary of the amounts recognized in accounting for the Acquisition:

The goodwill recognized is attributable to synergies which are expected to enhance and expand the Companys overall product portfolio and opportunities in new and existing markets, future technologies that have yet to be determined and Maxims assembled workforce. Future technologies do not meet the criteria for recognition separately from goodwill because they are part of future development and growth of the business.
There were no significant contingencies assumed as part of the Acquisition.
In aggregate, the Company recognized $174.0 million of transaction-related costs, including legal, accounting and other related fees that were expensed in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. These costs are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income in operating expenses within selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses.
The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended October 30, 2021 combines the results of the Company for fiscal 2021 and the unaudited results of Maxim for the corresponding period through the Acquisition Date. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information assumes that the Acquisition, which closed on August 26, 2021, was completed on November 3, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020). The pro forma consolidated financial information has been calculated after applying the Companys accounting policies and includes adjustments for amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, fair value adjustments for acquired inventory, property, plant and equipment and long-term debt and compensation expense for ongoing share-based compensation arrangements that were replaced in conjunction with the Acquisition, together with the consequential tax effects. These pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the operating results of the Company that would have been achieved had the Acquisition actually taken place on November 3, 2019. In addition, these results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect events that may occur after the Acquisition, including but not limited to revenue enhancements, cost savings or operating synergies that the combined Company may achieve as a result of the Acquisition.

Other investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other long-term investments. Investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting or cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For equity method investments, realized gains and losses are reflected in other, net based upon the Company's ownership share of the investee's financial results.

Total accrued liabilities $ 1,352,608 $ 1,594,650
9. Leases
The Company enters into operating leases which primarily relate to certain facilities and, to a lesser extent, finance leases. Finance leases were not a material component of the Company's lease portfolio in the periods presented. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present at the inception of an arrangement. Lease assets represent the Company's right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments over the lease term. At lease commencement, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received, such as construction allowances from landlords and/or rent abatements subsequent to taking possession of the leased property. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Non-lease components may include real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, parking and other operating costs. If these costs are variable costs they are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs. The Companys leases have remaining lease terms of less than one year to approximately twenty-two years, some of which may include options to extend the initial term of the lease. These options are included in determining the initial lease term at lease commencement only if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the option. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis as lease expense over the lease term. For leases with terms of twelve months or less the Company recognizes the related lease payments as expense either on a straight-line basis over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. The Company subleases certain properties that are not used in its core business operations (See Note 5, Special Charges, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Sublease income for fiscal 2023 was $12.9 million.

10. Commitments and Contingencies
From time to time, in the ordinary course of the Companys business, various claims, charges and litigation are asserted or commenced against the Company arising from, or related to, among other things, contractual matters, acquisitions, patents, trademarks, personal injury, environmental matters, product liability, insurance coverage, employment or employment benefits. As to such claims and litigation, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail.
On March 17, 2022, Walter E. Ryan and Ryan Asset Management, LLC, purported stockholders of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim), filed a putative class action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (C.A. No. 2022-0255) against the Company and the former directors of Maxim. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties by the individual defendants in connection with Maxims agreement, as part of the merger negotiations with the Company, to suspend Maxim dividends for up to four quarters prior to the closing of the Acquisition. The complaint further alleges that the Company aided
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs seek damages in an amount to be determined at trial, plaintiffs costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys and experts fees, costs and other expenses. On May 2, 2023, the Court of Chancery entered an order dismissing the action in its entirety and with prejudice. On May 9, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Reargument, which the Court denied on May 30, 2023. On June 21, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. The appeal is fully briefed and remains pending. The Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious arguments in response to the appeal and defenses to the underlying allegations; however, the Company is currently unable to determine the ultimate outcome of this matter or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential losses, if any.
The Company has supplier commitments of approximately $705.6 million for the purchase of materials and supplies in advance or with minimum purchase quantities through 2031.
11. Retirement Plans
The Company and its subsidiaries have various savings and retirement plans covering substantially all employees.
Defined Contribution Plans
The Company maintains a defined contribution plan for the benefit of its eligible U.S. employees. This plan provides for Company contributions of up to 5% of each participants total eligible compensation. In addition, the Company contributes an amount equal to each participants pre-tax contribution, if any, up to a maximum of 3% of each participants total eligible compensation. The total expense related to the defined contribution plans for all eligible U.S. employees was $76.0 million in fiscal 2023, $65.2 million in fiscal 2022 and $52.1 million in fiscal 2021.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan
The Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees and non-employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation. The DCP was established to provide participants with the opportunity to defer receiving all or a portion of their compensation, which includes salary, bonus, commissions and director fees. Under the DCP, the Company provides all participants (other than non-employee directors) with Company contributions equal to 8% of eligible deferred contributions. The DCP is a non-qualified plan that is maintained in a rabbi trust. The fair value of the investments held in the rabbi trust are included within other investments, with the current portion of the investment included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 2j, Fair Value, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments. The deferred compensation obligation represents DCP participant accumulated deferrals and earnings thereon since the inception of the DCP net of withdrawals. The deferred compensation obligation is included within other non-current liabilities, with the current portion of the obligation in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys liability under the DCP is an unsecured general obligation of the Company.
Defined Benefit Pension and Post Retirement Benefit Plans
The Company also has various defined benefit pension and other retirement plans for certain non-U.S. employees that are consistent with local statutory requirements and practices. The total expense related to the various defined benefit pension, contribution and other retirement plans for certain non-U.S. employees was $55.3 million in fiscal 2023, $51.4 million in fiscal 2022 and $45.9 million in fiscal 2021.
The Companys funding policy for its foreign defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country. The plans assets consist primarily of U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities, bonds, property and cash. The Company has elected to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of October 31, which is the month-end that is closest to its fiscal year-ends, which were October 28, 2023 for fiscal 2023 and October 29, 2022 for fiscal 2022.
As a result of the Acquisition, the Company acquired a postretirement plan that provides postretirement medical expenses to certain former employees of a Maxim acquired company and certain former Maxim executives in the U.S.

The accumulated benefit obligation for the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans was $120.1 million and $111.3 million at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.
Information relating to the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 is presented in the following table:
2023 2022

Fair value of plan assets $ 45,555 $ 2,573
Assumptions
The range of assumptions used for the Companys pension and postretirement benefit plans reflects the different economic environments within the various countries as well as the differences in the attributes of the participants.
The projected benefit obligation was determined using the following weighted-average assumptions:
2023 2022
Discount rate 5.73 % 5.44 %
Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.34 % 4.08 %
Net annual periodic benefit cost was determined using the following weighted average assumptions:
2023 2022
Discount rate 5.44 % 2.77 %
Expected long-term return on plan assets 5.84 % 3.73 %
Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.08 % 3.70 %
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
The expected long-term rate of return on assets is a weighted-average of the long-term rates of return selected for the various countries where the Company has funded pension plans. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is selected based on the facts and circumstances that exist as of the measurement date and the specific portfolio mix of plan assets. Management, in conjunction with its actuaries, reviewed anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset categories and considered the asset allocation strategy adopted by the Company and/or the trustees of the plans. While the review considered recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term prospective rate.
The Companys investment strategy is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term. Investments within each asset class are diversified to reduce the impact of losses in single investments. The use of derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary to achieve overall investment policy objectives and asset class targets. The Company establishes strategic asset allocation percentage targets and appropriate benchmarks for each significant asset class to obtain a prudent balance between return and risk. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied by the Company and its actuaries to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets.
Fair value of plan assets

The Companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was impacted by a discrete income tax benefit recorded of $81.7 million resulting from the approval granted by the Joint Committee on Taxation of its federal corporate income tax relief claim which reduced the amount of transition tax owed under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
U.S. tax legislation subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). Under U.S. GAAP, an accounting policy election can be made to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years. The Company elected the deferral method and recorded the corresponding GILTI deferred tax assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company carries other outside basis differences in its subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of October 28, 2023, the Company has not recognized deferred income tax on $33.6 billion of outside basis differences because of its intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest these basis differences. These basis differences could be reversed through a sale of the subsidiaries or the receipt of dividends from the subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which are considered probable at this time. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these outside basis differences is not practicable.

_______________________________________________
(1) As of October 28, 2023, the Company included the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses which began in fiscal 2023 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
The valuation allowances of $332.5 million and $339.1 million as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively, are primarily for the Companys state R&D credit carryforwards, foreign net operating losses and international credit carryforwards. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that these credit carryovers will not be realized and as a result has recorded a partial valuation allowance.
The federal and state net operating losses of $89.9 million will begin to expire in fiscal 2035 while foreign net operating loss carryovers of $145.2 million have no expiration date. There are also $299.7 million of federal and state credit carryovers and $14.2 million of foreign investment tax credit carryovers that begin to expire in the fiscal year ending November 1, 2025.
As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the Company had unrealized tax benefits, net of indirect tax benefits, of $187.4 million and $165.3 million, respectively, which if settled in the Company's favor, would lower the Company's effective tax rate in the period recorded. Liabilities for unrealized tax benefits are primarily classified as non-current because the Company believes that the ultimate payment or settlement of these liabilities will not occur within the next twelve months. As of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, the Company had liabilities of approximately $70.7 million and $45.5 million, respectively, for interest and penalties, which is included within the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

In fiscal 2021, the Company acquired $125.5 million in reserves as part of the Acquisition consisting of $91.2 million in tax and $34.3 million in accrued interest.
In fiscal 2023, the Company continued to engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the balance of unrealized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, could decrease by up to $160.0 million within the next twelve months due to the completion of federal tax audits, including any administrative appeals. The $160.0 million primarily relates to matters involving federal taxation of international income and cross-border transactions.
The Company has numerous audits ongoing at any time throughout the world including: an IRS income tax audit for fiscal year ended November 2, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and fiscal year ended November 3, 2018 (fiscal 2018), a pre-Acquisition IRS income tax audit for Maxim's fiscal years ended June 27, 2015 through August 26, 2021, and various U.S. state and local tax audits and international audits, including an Irish corporate tax audit for fiscal 2019. The Companys U.S. federal tax returns prior to fiscal 2018 are no longer subject to examination, except for the applicable Maxim pre-Acquisition fiscal years noted above.
13. Revolving Credit Facility
On June 23, 2021, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and the other banks identified therein as lenders, which was subsequently amended on December 20, 2022 and July 24, 2023 (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five year, unsecured, revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $2.5 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions).
In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Agreement, replacing the LIBOR interest rate provisions with interest rate provisions based on a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a 10 basis point credit spread adjustment. After the amendment, revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) at the Company's option. Each Term SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable adjusted term SOFR plus a margin based on the Company's Debt Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) from time to time of between 0.690% and 1.175%. As of October 28, 2023, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under this revolving credit facility but may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for repayment of existing indebtedness, stock repurchases, acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital and other lawful corporate purposes.
In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a facility fee based on the Company's Debt Ratings from time to time of between 0.060% and 0.200% multiplied by the actual daily amount of the Commitments (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) in effect. The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a sustainability-linked pricing component which provides
ANALOG DEVICES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on the Company meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage. For calendar year 2022, the Company was within its target threshold range for greenhouse gas emission which resulted in no pricing adjustment. The Company exceeded the target threshold for renewable energy usage, which resulted in a modest pricing benefit on its commitment fee and any future borrowings. This adjustment did not have a material impact on the Company's business, net income or financing costs. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a multicurrency borrowing feature for certain specified foreign currencies. The Company will guarantee the obligations of each subsidiary that is named a Designated Borrower under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. As of October 28, 2023, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

The 2045 Notes are subordinated to any future secured debt and to the other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries. The 2045 Notes were issued pursuant to a base indenture (the ADI Base Indenture) between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company as trustee, as supplemented by a supplemental indenture, which contain certain covenants, events of default and other customary provisions.

The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 28, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
(b) Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2023. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated 2013 Framework.
