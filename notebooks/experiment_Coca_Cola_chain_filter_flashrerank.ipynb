A lower temperature value (closer to 0) makes the model more confident in its choices, resulting in less random outputs, while a higher temperature value (closer to 1) encourages more randomness and diversity.\n",

It helps in generating text that is both diverse and coherent, avoiding the inclusion of very low-probability tokens that could make the text nonsensical.\n",
