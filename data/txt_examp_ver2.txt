About Air Product
Air Product and Chemical, Inc., a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, i a world-leading indutrial gae company that ha built a reputation for it innovative culture, operational excellence, and commitment to afety and the environment. Focued on erving energy, environmental, and emerging market, we offer a portfolio of product and ervice that enable cutomer to improve their environmental performance, product quality, and productivity.
Air Product ha a utainability-driven two-pillar growth trategy coniting of the expanion and efficient operation of our core indutrial gae buine and the execution of project that provide world-cale clean hydrogen. Our indutrial gae buine provide eential gae, related equipment, and application expertie to cutomer in dozen of indutrie, including refining, chemical, metal, electronic, manufacturing, medical, and food. We alo develop, engineer, build, own, and operate ome of the world larget clean hydrogen project that will upport the tranition to low- and zero-carbon energy in the heavy-duty tranportation and indutrial ector. Additionally, we are the world leader in the upply of liquefied natural ga ("LNG") proce technology and equipment and provide turbomachinery, membrane ytem, and cryogenic container globally.
We manage our operation, ae performance, and report earning under five reportable egment: America; Aia; Europe; Middle Eat and India; and Corporate and other. The dicuion that follow i baed on thee operation. Refer to Note 25, Buine Segment and Geographic Information, to the conolidated financial tatement for additional information.
Our Buinee
Indutrial Gae Buine
Our indutrial gae buine, which i organized and operated regionally in the America, Aia, Europe, and Middle Eat and India egment, produce and ell atmopheric gae uch a oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; proce gae uch a hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, and ynga (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and pecialty gae. Overall regional indutrial gae ale contituted over 90% of conolidated ale in fical year 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately half of which were attributable to atmopheric gae.
Each of the regional indutrial gae egment compete againt three global indutrial ga companie: Air Liquide S.A., Linde plc, and Meer Group GmbH, a well a regional competitor. Competition in indutrial gae i baed primarily on price, reliability of upply, and the development of indutrial ga application. We derive a competitive advantage in location where we have pipeline network, which enable u to provide a reliable and economic upply of product to our larger cutomer.
Production
Indutrial gae are generally produced at or near the point of ue given the complexity and inefficiency of toring molecule at low temperature. The indutrial gae buine develop, build, and operate equipment for the production or proceing of gae. Atmopheric gae are produced through variou air eparation procee, of which cryogenic ditillation i the mot prevalent, while proce gae are produced by method other than air eparation. To produce hydrogen, we purify byproduct ource obtained from the chemical and petrochemical indutrie. We have hitorically produced hydrogen from hydrocarbon excluively without carbon capture (known a "gray hydrogen"); however, we are alo inveting in project that are intended to create a reliable and conitent world-cale ource of low-carbon hydrogen produced from hydrocarbon with carbon capture (known a blue hydrogen) a well a carbon-free hydrogen produced from renewable energy (known a green hydrogen).
Electricity i the larget cot component in the production of atmopheric gae. To produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and ynga, team methane reformer ue natural ga a the primary raw material, while gaifier ue liquid and olid hydrocarbon a the primary raw material. We mitigate electricity, natural ga, and hydrocarbon price fluctuation contractually through pricing formula, urcharge, cot pa-through proviion, and tolling arrangement. During fical year 2023, no ignificant difficultie were encountered in obtaining adequate upplie of power and natural ga.
Helium i produced a a byproduct of gae extracted from underground reervoir, primarily natural ga a well a CO2 purified before reale. Becaue helium i generally ourced globally at long ditance from point of ale, we maintain an inventory of helium in our fleet of ISO container a well a at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management underground torage facility in Amarillo, Texa, and our torage cavern near Beaumont, Texa. We obtain helium from everal ource globally, including crude helium for purification from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management' helium reerve.
Supply Mode
We ditribute gae to our indutrial ga cutomer through different upply mode depending on variou factor including the cutomer' volume requirement and location. Our upply mode are a follow:
On-Site Gae-Supply mode aociated with cutomer, principally in the energy production and refining, chemical, metal, and electronic indutrie worldwide, that require large volume of gae and have relatively contant demand. Gae are produced and upplied by large facilitie we contruct or acquire on or near the cutomer facilitie or by pipeline ytem from centrally located production facilitie. Thee ale of ga contract are generally governed by 15- to 20-year contract. We alo deliver maller quantitie of product through mall on-ite plant (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generator), typically via a 10- to 15-year ale of ga contract. The contract within thi upply mode generally contain fixed monthly charge and/or minimum purchae requirement with price ecalation proviion that are typically baed on external indice. Our on-ite upply mode generate approximately half our total company ale.
Merchant Gae-Supply mode for liquid bulk and packaged ga product. Liquid bulk product i delivered in bulk in either liquid or gaeou form by tanker or tube trailer and tored, uually in it liquid tate, in equipment that we typically deign and intall at the cutomer ite for vaporizing into a gaeou tate a needed. Liquid bulk ale are uually governed by three- to five-year contract. Packaged ga product are delivered in mall quantitie in either cylinder or dewar. We operate packaged ga buinee in Europe, Aia, and Latin America.
We maintain inventory in location that facilitate upply of product to cutomer on a reaonable delivery chedule. Inventory conit primarily of crude helium, pecialty gae, and other indutrial gae upplied via the merchant gae upply mode.
End Ue
The refining indutry ue hydrogen to facilitate the converion of heavy crude feedtock and lower the ulfur content of gaoline and dieel fuel. Thi produce cleaner tranportation fuel that can be ued with other equipment, particularly in the developing hydrogen-for-mobility market, to ignificantly reduce emiion that contribute to climate change. Many other indutrie that already benefit from hydrogen unique propertie to improve quality, optimize performance, and reduce cot are alo looking to hydrogen a a fuel that can help decarbonize their manufacturing procee. We have hydrogen fueling tation that upport commercial market a well a demontration project acro the globe.
The chemical indutry ue hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and ynga a feedtock in the production of many baic chemical. The energy production indutry ue nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural ga and oxygen for gaification. Oxygen i ued in combution and indutrial heating application, including in the teel, certain nonferrou metal, gla, and cement indutrie. Nitrogen application are ued in food proceing for freezing and preerving flavor, and nitrogen i ued for inerting in variou field, including the metal, chemical, and emiconductor indutrie. Helium i ued in laboratorie and healthcare for cooling and in other indutrie for preurizing, purging, and lifting. Argon i ued in the metal and other indutrie for it unique inerting, thermal conductivity, and other propertie. Indutrial gae are alo ued in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in variou manufacturing procee to make them more efficient and to optimize performance.
Indutrial Gae Equipment
We deign and manufacture equipment for air eparation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural ga liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen tranport and torage. The Corporate and other egment include activity related to the ale of cryogenic and ga proceing equipment for air eparation.

Technology Development
We purue a market-oriented approach to technology development through reearch and development, engineering, and commercial development procee. We conduct reearch and development principally in our laboratorie located in the United State (Allentown, Pennylvania), the United Kingdom (Baingtoke and Carrington), Spain (Barcelona), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). We alo fund and cooperate in reearch and development program conducted by a number of major univeritie and undertake reearch work funded by other, including the United State government.
Development of technology for ue within the Indutrial Gae buine focue primarily on new and improved procee and equipment for the production and delivery of indutrial gae and new or improved application for indutrial ga product.
During fical year 2023, we owned approximately 625 United State patent, approximately 3,300 foreign patent, and were a licenee under certain patent owned by other. While the patent and licene are conidered important, we do not conider our buine a a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent licene, or group of patent or licene.
Environmental Regulation
We are ubject to variou environmental law, regulation, and public policie in the countrie in which we have operation. Compliance with thee meaure often reult in higher capital expenditure and cot. In the normal coure of buine, we are involved in legal proceeding under the Comprehenive Environmental Repone, Compenation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law); Reource Conervation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"); and imilar tate and foreign environmental law relating to the deignation of certain ite for invetigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditure i dicued in Note 1, Bai of Preentation and Major Accounting Policie, and environmental lo contingencie are dicued in Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, to the conolidated financial tatement, included under Item 8, below.
Some of our operation are within juridiction that have or are developing regulatory regime governing emiion of greenhoue gae (GHG), including CO2. Thee include exiting coverage under the European Union Emiion Trading Sytem, the California Cap-and-Trade Program, China Emiion Trading Scheme and it nation-wide expanion, and South Korea Emiion Trading Scheme. In the Netherland, a CO2 emiion tax wa enacted on 1 January 2021. In Canada, Alberta Technology Innovation and Emiion Reduction Sytem went into effect 1 January 2020. In Ontario, Environment & Climate Change Canada Output Baed Pricing Sytem (OBPS) wa replaced by the GHG Emiion Performance Standard ("EPS") program beginning 1 January 2022. In Singapore, the Carbon Pricing Tax Act wa implemented effective 1 January 2019. In Taiwan, Greenhoue Gae Emiion Regitration and Verification Management Act will be enforced beginning in 2023. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) require mandatory reporting of GHG emiion and i regulating GHG emiion for new contruction and major modification to exiting facilitie. The European Union ha iued the Corporate Sutainability Reporting Directive ("CSRD") and California ha enacted the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate Related Financial Rik Act that will require reporting and third-party aurance of GHG emiion information for certain entitie, and a imilar propoal i under conideration by the U.S. Securitie and Exchange Commiion ("SEC"). Furthermore, ome juridiction have variou mechanim to target the power ector to achieve emiion reduction, which often reult in higher power cot.
Increaed public concern may reult in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirement to reduce or mitigate the effect of GHG emiion. Although uncertain, thee development could increae our cot related to conumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gaification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate ome of the increaed cot through contractual term, but the lack of definitive legilation or regulatory requirement prevent an accurate etimate of the long-term impact thee meaure will have on our operation. Any legilation that limit or taxe GHG emiion could negatively impact our growth, increae our operating cot, or reduce demand for certain of our product.
Regulation of GHG may alo produce new opportunitie for u. We continue to develop technologie to help our facilitie and our cutomer lower energy conumption, improve efficiency and lower emiion. We ee ignificant opportunitie for hydrogen for mobility and energy tranition, carbon capture technologie, and gaification.
Expenditure for capital project intended to control pollution from exiting operating facilitie a required under current environmental regulation were not material in fical year 2023, 2022, and 2021. We do not expect material expenditure for thee project in fical year 2024.
For additional information regarding environmental matter, refer to Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, to the conolidated financial tatement.

Item 1A. Rik Factor
Our operation are affected by variou rik, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating invetment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in thi Annual Report on Form 10-K or preented elewhere from time to time, you hould carefully conider the rik factor dicued below. Any of thee rik could have a material advere effect on our buine, operating reult, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matter a to which forward-looking tatement are made and could adverely affect the value of an invetment in our ecuritie. The rik decribed below are not all incluive but are deigned to highlight what we believe are important factor to conider when evaluating our expectation. In addition to uch rik, there may be additional rik and uncertaintie that adverely affect our buine, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not preently known, are not currently believed to be ignificant, or are not identified below becaue they are common to all buinee.
Rik Related to Economic Condition
Change in global and regional economic condition, the market we erve, or the financial market may adverely affect our reult of operation and cah flow.
Unfavorable condition in the global economy or regional economie, the market we erve or financial market may decreae the demand for our good and ervice and adverely impact our revenue, operating reult, and cah flow.
Demand for our product and ervice depend in part on the general economic condition affecting the countrie and market in which we do buine. Weak economic condition in certain geographie and changing upply and demand balance in the market we erve have negatively impacted demand for our product and ervice in the pat and may do o in the future. In addition, our growth trategy i largely baed on demand for technologie and project that limit the impact of global climate change. Demand for our olution could be negatively impacted if public and private actor reduce their focu on reducing carbon emiion. Reduced demand for our product and ervice would have a negative impact on our revenue and earning. In addition, reduced demand could depre ale, decreae our margin, contrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or reult in charge which are unuual or nonrecurring. Exce capacity in our manufacturing facilitie or thoe of our competitor could decreae our ability to maintain pricing and generate profit.
In addition, our operating reult in one or more egment may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic condition for particular cutomer market within a egment. A decline in the indutrie erved by our cutomer or advere event or circumtance affecting individual cutomer can reduce demand for our product and ervice and impair the ability of uch cutomer to atify their obligation to u, reulting in uncollected receivable, unanticipated contract termination, project delay or the inability to recover plant invetment, any of which may negatively impact our financial reult.
Weak overall demand or pecific cutomer condition may alo caue cutomer hutdown or default or otherwie make u unable to operate facilitie profitably and may force ale or abandonment of facilitie and equipment or prevent project from coming on-tream when expected. Thee or other event aociated with weak economic condition or pecific market, product, or cutomer event may require u to record an impairment on tangible aet, uch a facilitie and equipment, or intangible aet, uch a intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial reult.
Our extenive international operation can be adverely impacted by operational, economic, political, ecurity, legal, and currency tranlation rik that could decreae profitability.
In fical year 2023, approximately 60% of our ale were derived from cutomer outide the United State and many of our operation, upplier, and employee are located outide the United State. Our operation in foreign juridiction may be ubject to rik including exchange control regulation, import and trade retriction, trade policy and other potentially detrimental dometic and foreign governmental practice or policie affecting U.S. companie doing buine abroad. Changing economic and political condition within foreign juridiction, trained relation between countrie, or the impoition of tariff or international anction can caue fluctuation in demand, price volatility, upply diruption, or lo of property. The occurrence of any of thee rik could have a material advere impact on our financial condition, reult of operation, and cah flow.
Our growth trategie depend in part on our ability to further penetrate market outide the United State, uch a China, India, and the Middle Eat, and involve ignificantly larger and more complex project, including gaification and large-cale hydrogen project, ome in region where there i the potential for ignificant economic and political diruption. We are actively inveting large amount of capital and other reource, in ome cae through joint venture, in developing market, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operation in thee market may be ubject to greater rik than thoe faced by our operation in mature economie, including political and economic intability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government action, inadequate invetment in infratructure, undeveloped property right and legal ytem, unfamiliar regulatory environment, relationhip with local partner, language and cultural difference and increaed difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employee. In addition, our propertie and contract in thee location may be ubject to eizure and cancellation, repectively, without full compenation for lo. Succeful operation of particular facilitie or execution of project may be dirupted by civil unret, act of war, abotage or terrorim, and other local ecurity concern. Such concern may require u to incur greater cot for ecurity or require u to hut down operation for a period of time.
Furthermore, becaue the majority of our revenue i generated from ale outide the United State, we are expoed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate. Our buine i primarily expoed to tranlational currency rik a the reult of our foreign operation are tranlated into U.S. dollar at current exchange rate throughout the fical period. Our policy i to minimize cah flow volatility from change in currency exchange rate. We chooe not to hedge the tranlation of our foreign ubidiarie earning into dollar. Accordingly, reported ale, net earning, cah flow, and fair value have been, and in the future will be, affected by change in foreign exchange rate. For a more detailed dicuion of currency expoure, ee Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Dicloure About Market Rik, below.
Rik Related to Our Buine
Rik related to the approval, execution, and operation of our project, particularly with repect to our larget project, may adverely affect our operation or financial reult.
A ignificant and growing portion of our buine involve clean hydrogen, carbon capture, gaification, and other large-cale project that involve challenging engineering, procurement and contruction phae that may lat everal year and involve the invetment of billion of dollar. Thee project are technically complex, often reliant on ignificant interaction with government authoritie, and face ignificant financing, development, operational, and reputational rik. Thee project may alo be ubject to complex government approval, a well a legal or regulatory challenge by government authoritie or third partie. Delay in receiving required approval or related to litigation could require u to delay or abandon certain project, which may reult in the incurrence of additional expene, the lo of inveted proceed and reputational damage.
We have in the pat and may in the future encounter difficultie related to the development of project that may reult in delay, cope change and additional cot. Such difficultie may relate to engineering, delay in deign or material provided by the cutomer or a third party, equipment and material delivery delay, chedule change, cutomer cope change, delay related to obtaining regulatory permit and right-of-way, inability to find adequate ource of labor in the location where we are building new plant, weather-related delay, delay by cutomer' contractor in completing their portion of a project, technical or tranportation difficultie, cot overrun, upply difficultie, geopolitical rik and other factor, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery chedule. In ome cae, delay and additional cot may be ubtantial and could have a material advere effect on our financial condition and reult of operation. We alo may be required to cancel a project and/or compenate the cutomer for the delay, which may alo caue u to incur material cot that we may be unable to recover. In addition, in ome cae we eek financing for large project and face market rik aociated with the availability and term of uch financing. Thee financing arrangement may require that we comply with certain performance requirement which, if not met, could reult in default and retructuring cot or other loe. All of thee factor could alo negatively impact our reputation or relationhip with our cutomer, upplier and other third partie, any of which could adverely affect our ability to ecure new project in the future.
In addition, everal of our large-cale project are being built before finalization of offtake agreement, which may create uncertainty regarding future pricing and other commercial term. If we are unable to enter into favorable commercial agreement with propective cutomer, our projected return could be adverely impacted, which may harm our buine and financial performance.
The operation of our facilitie, pipeline, and delivery ytem inherently entail hazard that require continuou overight and control, uch a pipeline leak and rupture, fire, exploion, toxic releae, mechanical failure, vehicle accident, or cyber incident. If operational rik materialize, they could reult in lo of life, damage to the environment, or lo of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operation, reputation, financial reult, and cah flow. In addition, our operating reult are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilitie and our ability to meet cutomer requirement, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging aet.
We are ubject to extenive government regulation in the juridiction in which we do buine. Regulation addreing, among other thing, import/export retriction, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxe, can negatively impact our financial condition, reult of operation, and cah flow.
We are ubject to government regulation in the United State and in the foreign juridiction where we conduct buine. The application of law and regulation to our buine i ometime unclear. Compliance with law and regulation may involve ignificant cot or require change in buine practice that could reult in reduced profitability. If there i a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable law or regulation, we may be ubject to penaltie or anction that could adverely impact our reputation and financial reult. Compliance with change in law or regulation can reult in increaed operating cot and require additional, unplanned capital expenditure. Export control or other regulatory retriction could prevent u from hipping our product to and from ome market or increae the cot of doing o. Change in tax law and regulation and international tax treatie could affect the financial reult of our buinee. Increaingly aggreive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirement, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could ubject u to criminal or civil anction if a violation i deemed to have occurred. In addition, we are ubject to law and anction impoed by the U.S. and other juridiction where we do buine that may prohibit u, or certain of our affiliate, from doing buine in certain countrie, or retricting the kind of buine that we may conduct. Such retriction may provide a competitive advantage to competitor who are not ubject to comparable retriction or prevent u from taking advantage of growth opportunitie.
Further, we cannot guarantee that our internal control and compliance ytem will alway protect u from act committed by employee, agent, buine partner or that buinee that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. law, including the law governing payment to government official, bribery, fraud, kickback and fale claim, pricing, ale and marketing practice, conflict of interet, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. Any uch improper action or allegation of uch act could damage our reputation and ubject u to civil or criminal invetigation in the U.S. and in other juridiction and related hareholder lawuit, could lead to ubtantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penaltie, and could caue u to incur ignificant legal and invetigatory fee. In addition, the government may eek to hold u liable a a ucceor for violation committed by companie in which we invet or that we acquire.
We may be unable to uccefully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquiition, manage our joint venture, or effectively dientangle diveted buinee.
Our ability to grow revenue, earning, and cah flow at anticipated rate depend in part on our ability to identify, uccefully acquire and integrate buinee and aet at appropriate price, and realize expected growth, ynergie, and operating efficiencie. We may not be able to complete tranaction on favorable term, on a timely bai or at all. In addition, our reult of operation and cah flow may be adverely impacted by the failure of acquired buinee or aet to meet expected return, the failure to integrate acquired buinee, the inability to dipoe of non-core aet and buinee on atifactory term and condition, and the dicovery of unanticipated liabilitie or other problem in acquired buinee or aet for which we lack adequate contractual protection or inurance. In addition, we may incur aet impairment charge related to acquiition that do not meet expectation.
In addition, ome of our larget project involve joint venture. Thee arrangement may involve ignificant rik and uncertaintie, including our ability to cooperate with our trategic partner, our trategic partner having interet or goal that are inconitent with our, and the potential that our trategic partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation to the joint venture, which may negatively impact the expected benefit of the joint venture and caue u to incur additional expene or uffer reputational damage. In addition, due to the nature of thee arrangement, we may have limited ability to direct or influence the management of the joint venture, which may limit our ability to ait and overee the deign and implementation of the joint venture buine a well a it accounting, legal, governance, human reource, information technology, and other adminitrative ytem. Thi may expoe u to additional rik and uncertaintie becaue we may be dependent upon and ubject to liability, loe, or reputational damage relating to ytem, control, and peronnel that are not under our control. Thee rik may be augmented when the joint venture i operating outide the United State due to difference in language, culture, and regulation, a well a the factor lited above that are relevant to our international operation.
We continually ae the trategic fit of our exiting buinee and may divet buinee that are deemed not to fit with our trategic plan or are not achieving the deired return on invetment. Thee tranaction poe rik and challenge that could negatively impact our buine and financial tatement. For example, when we decide to ell or otherwie dipoe of a buine or aet, we may be unable to do o on atifactory term within our anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, divetiture or other dipoition may dilute our earning per hare, have other advere financial and accounting impact, ditract management, and give rie to dipute with buyer. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyer againt known and unknown contingent liabilitie. Our financial reult could be impacted adverely by claim under thee indemnification proviion.
The ecurity of our information technology ytem could be compromied, which could adverely affect our ability to operate.
We depend on information technology to enable u to operate afely and efficiently and interface with our cutomer a well a to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilitie are delivered through a combination of internal and external ervice and ervice provider. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the reource neceary to build and utain the proper technology infratructure, we could be ubject to tranaction error, proceing inefficiencie, the lo of cutomer, buine diruption, property damage, or the lo of or damage to our confidential buine information due to a ecurity breach. In addition, our information technology ytem may be damaged, dirupted or hut down due to attack by computer hacker, computer virue, employee error or malfeaance, power outage, hardware failure, telecommunication or utility failure, catatrophe or other unforeeen event, and in any uch circumtance our ytem redundancy and other diater recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breache of our ytem (or the ytem of our cutomer, upplier or other buine partner) could reult in the miappropriation, detruction or unauthorized acce or dicloure of confidential information or peronal data belonging to u or to our employee, partner, cutomer or upplier, and may ubject u to legal liability.
A with mot large ytem, our information technology ytem have in the pat been, and in the future likely will be ubject to computer virue, maliciou code, unauthorized acce and other cyber-attack, and we expect the ophitication and frequency of uch attack to continue to increae. To date, we are not aware of any ignificant impact on our operation or financial reult from uch attempt; however, unauthorized acce could dirupt our buine operation, reult in the lo of aet, and have a material advere effect on our buine, financial condition, or reult of operation. Any of the attack, breache or other diruption or damage decribed above could: interrupt our operation at one or more ite; delay production and hipment; reult in the theft of our and our cutomer intellectual property and trade ecret; damage cutomer and buine partner relationhip and our reputation; reult in defective product or ervice, phyical damage to facilitie, pipeline or delivery ytem, including thoe we own or operate for third partie, legal claim and proceeding, liability and penaltie under privacy law, or increaed cot for ecurity and remediation; or raie concern regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of thee conequence could adverely affect our buine, reputation and our financial tatement.
Our buine involve the ue, torage, and tranmiion of information about our employee, vendor, and cutomer. The protection of uch information, a well a our proprietary information, i critical to u. The regulatory environment urrounding information ecurity and privacy i increaingly demanding, with the frequent impoition of new and contantly changing requirement. We have etablihed policie and procedure to help protect the ecurity and privacy of thi information. We alo, from time to time, export enitive cutomer data and technical information to recipient outide the United State. Breache of our ecurity meaure or the accidental lo, inadvertent dicloure, or unapproved diemination of proprietary information or enitive or confidential data about u or our cutomer, including the potential lo or dicloure of uch information or data a a reult of fraud, trickery, or other form of deception, could expoe u, our cutomer, or the individual affected to a rik of lo or miue of thi information, which could ultimately reult in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. Thee event could alo damage our reputation or otherwie harm our buine.
Interruption in ordinary ource of raw material or energy upply or an inability to recover increae in energy and raw material cot from cutomer could reult in lot ale or reduced profitability.
Hydrocarbon, including natural ga, are the primary feedtock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and ynga. Energy, including electricity, natural ga, and dieel fuel for delivery truck, i the larget cot component of our buine. Becaue our indutrial ga facilitie ue ubtantial amount of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuation have impacted our revenue and earning and may continue to do o in the future. A diruption in the upply of energy, component, or raw material, whether due to market condition, legilative or regulatory action, natural diater, public health crie and pandemic, or other diruption, could prevent u from meeting our contractual commitment and harm our buine and financial reult.
Our upply of crude helium for purification and reale i largely dependent upon natural ga production by crude helium upplier. Lower natural ga production reulting from natural ga pricing dynamic, upplier operating or tranportation iue, or other interruption in ale from crude helium upplier, can reduce our upplie of crude helium available for proceing and reale to cutomer.
We typically contract to pa-through cot increae in energy and raw material to cutomer, but uch cot pa-through reult in declining margin, and cot variability can negatively impact our other operating reult. For example, we may be unable to raie price a quickly a cot rie, or competitive preure may prevent full recovery of uch cot. In addition, increae in energy or raw material cot that cannot be paed on to cutomer for competitive or other reaon may negatively impact our revenue and earning. Even where cot are paed through, price increae can caue lower ale volume.
New technologie create performance rik that could impact our financial reult or reputation.
We are continually developing and implementing new technologie and product offering. Exiting technologie are being implemented in product and deign or at cale beyond our experience bae. Thee technological expanion can create nontraditional performance rik to our operation. Failure of the technologie to work a predicted, or unintended conequence of new deign or ue, could lead to cot overrun, project delay, financial penaltie, or damage to our reputation. We may face difficultie marketing product produced uing new technologie including, but not limited to, green hydrogen, which may adverely impact our ale and financial reult. In addition, certain large-cale project may contain procee or technologie that we have not operated at the ame cale or in the ame combination, and although uch project generally include technologie and procee that have been demontrated previouly by other, uch technologie or procee may be new to u and may introduce new rik to our operation. Additionally, there i alo a rik that our new technologie may become obolete and be replaced by other market alternative. Performance difficultie on thee larger project may have a material advere effect on our operation and financial reult. In addition, performance challenge may adverely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contract.
Protecting our intellectual property i critical to our technological development, and we may uffer competitive harm from infringement on uch right.
A we develop new technologie, it i critical that we protect our intellectual property aet againt third-party infringement. We own a number of patent and other form of intellectual property related to our product and ervice. A we develop new technologie there i a rik that our patent application may not be granted, or we may not receive ufficient protection of our proprietary interet. We may alo expend coniderable reource in defending our patent againt third-party infringement. It i critical that we protect our proprietary interet to prevent competitive harm.
Legal and Regulatory Rik
Legilative, regulatory, ocietal, and market effort to addre global climate change may impact our buine and create financial rik.
We are the world leading upplier of hydrogen, the primary ue of which i the production of ultra-low ulfur tranportation fuel that have ignificantly reduced tranportation emiion and helped improve human health. To make the high volume of hydrogen needed by our cutomer, we have hitorically ued team methane reforming to produce hydrogen without carbon capture (i.e., "gray hydrogen"), which reult in the emiion of carbon dioxide. In addition, gaification enable the converion of lower value feedtock into cleaner energy and value-added product; however, our gaification project alo produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operation are within juridiction that have or are developing regulatory regime governing dicloure of GHG emiion, including CO2, uch a the European Union' CSRD, California Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Rik Act, and imilar regulation under conideration by the SEC, which may lead to direct and indirect cot on our operation. We could alo face crutiny from takeholder regarding our reporting under variou framework for dicloing GHG emiion-related data, including thoe we ue currently in our utainability reporting. If our GHG emiion-related data, procee, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to comply with relevant reporting framework from newly emerging regulation, we may incur monetary penaltie and reputational harm, and we could become ubject to litigation or government invetigation, which may alo adverely affect our reputation and buine.
Increaed public concern and governmental action may reult in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirement to reduce or mitigate the effect of GHG emiion or increaed demand for technologie and project to limit the impact of global climate change. Although uncertain, thee development could increae our cot related to conumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and application of our gaification technology, although thee development may be mitigated by our growth trategy focued on world-cale clean hydrogen project. We believe we will be able to mitigate ome of the increaed cot through contractual term, but the lack of definitive legilation or regulatory requirement prevent an accurate etimate of the long-term impact thee meaure will have on our operation. Any legilation or governmental action that limit or taxe GHG emiion could negatively impact our growth, increae our operating cot, or reduce demand for certain of our product, particularly for our core indutrial gae buine.
In addition, our growth trategy i partially dependent on a regulatory environment that favor technologie focued on limiting the impact of climate change, in particular toward the production and ditribution of clean hydrogen. For example, we anticipate benefit from tax incentive created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon equetration and clean hydrogen production in future year once our project in thee area come on-tream in the U.S. If there i a reveral in the regulatory environment or a dicontinuation or reduction of incentive or benefit for the development of technologie limiting the impact of climate change, particularly thoe focued on low- and zero-carbon hydrogen production, demand for our product may be le than we anticipate and certain project and our long-term growth trategy could be adverely affected, which could adverely affect our buine and financial performance.
Our operation may preent a afety rik to our employee.
Notwithtanding our emphai on the afety of our employee and contractor and the precaution we take related to health and afety, we may be unable to avoid afety incident relating to our operation that reult in injurie or death. Certain afety incident may reult in legal or regulatory action that could reult in increaed expene or reputational damage. We maintain worker' compenation inurance to addre the rik of incurring material liabilitie for injurie or death, but there can be no aurance that the inurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on term acceptable to u, or at all, which could reult in material liabilitie to u for any injurie or death. Change to federal, tate, and local employee health and afety regulation, and legilative, regulatory, or ocietal repone to afety incident may reult in heightened regulation or public crutiny that may increae our compliance cot or reult in reputational damage.
Our buine depend on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employee.
Our ucce depend on our ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain employee with the kill neceary to our buine. Competitive labor market condition have reulted in increaed demand for qualified peronnel, which make it difficult to attract, hire, and retain employee with pecialized technical experience. In addition, the increaing number of experienced employee becoming retirement-eligible and our company headcount growth further amplify thi challenge. The number of our employee ha grown both internationally and in the United State, with our total headcount increaing from approximately 16,300 at the end of fical 2018 to approximately 23,000 at the end of fical 2023. Our reult of operation have been and in the future could be adverely affected by increaed cot due to increaed competition for killed talent in the market. In addition, increaed turnover and decreaed tenure of employee may impact productivity, cot, and organizational culture. We undertake ignificant effort to hire, engage, and retain our employee and to effectively manage workforce cot, even with rapid political, ocial, and economic hift in our market. If thee effort are unucceful, our growth may be limited and we may uffer financial or reputational harm that could have a material advere effect on our buine, financial condition, or reult of operation.
Our financial reult may be affected by variou legal and regulatory proceeding, including antitrut, tax, environmental, or other matter.
We are ubject to litigation and regulatory invetigation and proceeding in the normal coure of buine and could become ubject to additional claim in the future, ome of which could be material. While we eek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangement, there are no guarantee that each contract will contain uitable limitation of liability or that limitation of liability will be enforceable. Alo, the outcome of exiting legal proceeding may differ from our expectation becaue the outcome of litigation, including regulatory matter, are often difficult to predict reliably. Variou factor or development can lead u to change current etimate of liabilitie and related inurance receivable, where applicable, or make uch etimate for matter previouly not uceptible to reaonable etimate, uch a a ignificant judicial ruling or judgment, a ignificant ettlement, ignificant regulatory development, or change in applicable law. A future advere ruling, ettlement, or unfavorable development could reult in charge that could have a material advere effect on our financial condition, reult of operation, and cah flow in any particular period.
Cot and expene reulting from compliance with environmental regulation may negatively impact our operation and financial reult.
We are ubject to extenive federal, tate, local, and foreign environmental and afety law and regulation concerning, among other thing, emiion in the air; dicharge to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and dipoal of hazardou wate and other material. We take our environmental reponibilitie very eriouly, but there i a rik of advere environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operation and in the tranportation of our product. Future development and more tringent environmental regulation may require u to make additional unforeeen environmental expenditure. In addition, law and regulation may require ignificant expenditure for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. Thee additional cot may adverely affect our financial reult. For a more detailed decription of thee matter, ee Item 1, Buine-Environmental Regulation, above.
A change of tax law in key juridiction could reult in a material increae in our tax expene.
The multinational nature of our buine ubject u to taxation in the United State and numerou foreign juridiction. Due to economic and political condition, tax rate in variou juridiction may be ubject to ignificant change. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by change in the mix of earning in countrie with differing tatutory tax rate, change in the valuation of deferred tax aet and liabilitie, or change in tax law or their interpretation.
Change to income tax law and regulation in any of the juridiction in which we operate, or in the interpretation of uch law, could ignificantly increae our effective tax rate and adverely impact our financial condition, reult of operation, or cah flow. Variou level of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increaingly focued on tax reform and other legilative action to increae tax revenue. Further change in tax law in the U.S. or foreign juridiction where we operate could have a material advere effect on our buine, reult of operation, or financial condition.
General Rik Factor
Catatrophic event could dirupt our operation or the operation of our upplier or cutomer, having a negative impact on our buine, financial reult, and cah flow.
Our operation could be impacted by catatrophic event outide our control, including evere weather condition uch a hurricane, flood, earthquake, torm, epidemic, pandemic, act of war, and terrorim. Any uch event could caue a eriou buine diruption that could affect our ability to produce and ditribute product and poibly expoe u to third-party liability claim. Additionally, uch event could impact our upplier, cutomer, and partner, which could caue energy and raw material to be unavailable to u, or our cutomer to be unable to purchae or accept our product and ervice. Any uch occurrence could have a negative impact on our operation and financial reult.
Inability to compete effectively in a egment could adverely impact ale and financial performance.
We face trong competition from large global competitor and many maller regional competitor in many of our buine egment. Introduction by competitor of new technologie, competing product, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our product, negatively impacting financial reult. In addition, competitor pricing policie could affect our profitability or market hare.

Our Corporate and other egment alo ha management, ale, engineering upport, and corporate adminitrative function that are baed in our adminitrative office referred to above.
Item 3. Legal Proceeding
In the normal coure of buine, we and our ubidiarie are involved in variou legal proceeding, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and inurance matter. Although litigation with repect to thee matter i routine and incidental to the conduct of our buine, uch litigation could reult in large monetary award, epecially if compenatory and/or punitive damage are awarded. However, we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be reolved without any material advere effect on our financial poition, earning, or cah flow.
From time to time, we are alo involved in proceeding, invetigation, and audit involving governmental authoritie in connection with environmental, health, afety, competition, and tax matter.
We are a party to proceeding under CERCLA, RCRA, and imilar tate and foreign environmental law relating to the deignation of certain ite for invetigation or remediation. Preently there are 27 ite on which a final ettlement ha not been reached where we, uually along with other, have been deignated a potentially reponible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or are otherwie engaged in invetigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing ite. We do not expect that any um we may have to pay in connection with thee environmental matter would have a material advere impact on our conolidated financial poition. Additional information on our environmental expoure i included under Item 1, Buine-Environmental Regulation, and Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, to the conolidated financial tatement.
In September 2010, the Brazilian Adminitrative Council for Economic Defene ("CADE") iued a deciion againt our Brazilian ubidiary, Air Product Brail Ltda., and everal other Brazilian indutrial ga companie for alleged anticompetitive activitie. CADE impoed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $36 million at 30 September 2023) on Air Product Brail Ltda. Thi fine wa baed on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Minitry of Jutice, following an invetigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition law with repect to the ale of indutrial and medical gae. The fine are baed on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.
We have denied the allegation made by the authoritie and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian court. On 6 May 2014, our appeal wa granted and the fine againt Air Product Brail Ltda. wa dimied. CADE ha appealed that ruling and the matter remain pending. We, with advice of our outide legal counel, have aeed the tatu of thi matter and have concluded that, although an advere final judgment after exhauting all appeal i poible, uch a judgment i not probable. A a reult, no proviion ha been made in the conolidated financial tatement. In the event of an advere final judgment, we etimate the maximum poible lo to be the full amount of the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $36 million at 30 September 2023) plu interet accrued thereon until final dipoition of the proceeding.
In April 2023, we received a favorable ruling from a Texa tate court in litigation involving diputed energy management charge related to Winter Storm Uri, a evere winter weather torm that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coat in February 2021. The ruling i ubject to appeal and had no impact on our conolidated financial tatement for the fical year ended 30 September 2023.
Other than the matter dicued above, we do not currently believe there are any legal proceeding, individually or in the aggregate, that are reaonably poible to have a material impact on our financial condition, reult of operation, or cah flow. However, a future charge for regulatory fine or damage award could have a ignificant impact on our net income in the period in which it i recorded.

2023 IN SUMMARY
In fical year 2023, we achieved earning growth through pricing dicipline in our merchant buine a well a improved on-ite volume, including higher demand for hydrogen, depite inflation, higher maintenance activitie, and higher cot to upport our long-term trategy. Due to the tructure of our contract, which generally contain fixed monthly charge and/or minimum purchae requirement, our on-ite buine generate table cah flow and conitently contribute about half our total ale, regardle of the economic environment. We alo recognized higher income from our equity affiliate due to the contribution of the econd phae of the Jazan gaification and power project and poitive reult from other unconolidated joint venture acro the region.
Additionally, we uccefully ecured capital to fund low- and zero-carbon hydrogen growth project. In March, we iued our inaugural green bond in concurrent $600 and 700 million debt offering, making Air Product the firt U.S. chemical company to qualify green and blue hydrogen project a an eligible expenditure category. Additionally, in May, our NEOM Green Hydrogen Company joint venture completed financial cloe on the world larget green hydrogen-baed ammonia production facility, ecuring $6.1 billion of non-recoure financing from local, regional, and international bank and financial intitution. Thi funding i an important trategic miletone that will allow u to continue executing project that will accelerate the energy tranition while creating long-term value for our hareholder.
In addition to inveting in high return project, we believe creating hareholder value include paying quarterly cah dividend on our common tock, which we have increaed for 41 conecutive year. In fical year 2023, we increaed our dividend to $1.75 per hare, repreenting an 8% increae, or $0.13 per hare, from the previou dividend of $1.62 per hare.

OUTLOOK
The guidance below hould be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statement of thi Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The firt pillar of our two-pillar growth trategy i our core indutrial ga buine, which i upported by a conitent tream of revenue due to the tructure of our on-ite contract. We expect new on-ite project, including the natural ga-to-ynga proceing facility in Uzbekitan, a well a everal new LNG ale of equipment project to contribute to our reult in 2024. To mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary preure, we are focued on action we can control, uch a maintaining pricing dicipline in our merchant buine. Additionally, we expect to ee cot improvement in certain area of our organization a a reult of trategic buine action taken earlier in 2023.
The econd pillar of our trategy i our blue and green hydrogen project, many of which are already under execution. We anticipate benefit from tax incentive created by the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for carbon equetration and clean hydrogen production in future year once our project in thee area come on-tream, uch a our blue hydrogen and blue ammonia clean energy complex in Louiiana. We are alo gaining upport from foreign regulator for our project outide the U.S., including the recently announced blue hydrogen project in the Netherland. We believe the infratructure readine we are preparing now will continue to be a competitive advantage for Air Product, allowing u to create utainable growth opportunitie that deliver value to our hareholder, cutomer, employee, and communitie around the world.

RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
(Million of U.S. Dollar unle otherwie indicated, except for per hare data)
We preent certain financial meaure, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principle ("GAAP"), on an "adjuted" or "non-GAAP" bai. On a conolidated bai, thee meaure include adjuted diluted earning per hare ("EPS"), adjuted EBITDA, adjuted EBITDA margin, the adjuted effective tax rate, and capital expenditure. On a egment bai, thee meaure include adjuted EBITDA and adjuted EBITDA margin. In addition to thee meaure, we alo preent certain upplemental non-GAAP financial meaure to help the reader undertand the impact that certain dicloed item, or "non-GAAP adjutment," have on the calculation of our adjuted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial meaure, we preent a reconciliation to the mot directly comparable financial meaure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
In many cae, non-GAAP financial meaure are determined by adjuting the mot directly comparable GAAP meaure to exclude non-GAAP adjutment that we believe are not repreentative of our underlying buine performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-ervice component of net periodic benefit/cot for our defined benefit penion plan a further dicued below. Additionally, we may exclude certain expene aociated with cot reduction action, impairment charge, and gain on dicloed tranaction. The reader hould be aware that we may recognize imilar loe or gain in the future.
When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjutment reflect the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjutment. Thee tax impact are primarily driven by the tatutory tax rate of the variou relevant juridiction and the taxability of the adjutment in thoe juridiction.
We provide thee non-GAAP financial meaure to allow invetor, potential invetor, ecuritie analyt, and other to evaluate the performance of our buine in the ame manner a our management. We believe thee meaure, when viewed together with financial reult computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete undertanding of the factor and trend affecting our hitorical financial performance and projected future reult. However, we caution reader not to conider thee meaure in iolation or a a ubtitute for the mot directly comparable meaure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reader hould alo conider the limitation aociated with thee non-GAAP financial meaure, including the potential lack of comparability of thee meaure from one company to another.
NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENT FOR NON-SERVICE PENSION COST (BENEFIT), NET
Our adjuted EPS and the adjuted effective tax rate exclude the impact of non-ervice related component of net periodic benefit/cot for our defined benefit penion plan. The prior year non-GAAP financial meaure preented above and reconciled below have been recat accordingly to conform to the fical year 2023 preentation. Non-ervice related component are recurring, non-operating item that include interet cot, expected return on plan aet, prior ervice cot amortization, actuarial lo amortization, a well a pecial termination benefit, curtailment, and ettlement. The net impact of non-ervice related component i reflected within Other non-operating income (expene), net on our conolidated income tatement. Adjuting for the impact of non-ervice penion component provide management and uer of our financial tatement with a more accurate repreentation of our underlying buine performance becaue thee component are driven by factor that are unrelated to our operation, uch a recent change to the allocation of our penion plan aet aociated with de-riking a well a volatility in equity and debt market. Further, non-ervice related component are not indicative of our defined benefit plan future contribution need due to the funded tatu of the plan.

The table below provide a reconciliation to the mot directly comparable GAAP meaure for each of the major component ued to calculate adjuted diluted EPS from continuing operation, which we view a a key performance metric. In period that we have non-GAAP adjutment, we believe it i important for the reader to undertand the per hare impact of each uch adjutment becaue management doe not conider thee impact when evaluating underlying buine performance. Per hare impact are calculated independently and may not um to total diluted EPS and total adjuted diluted EPS due to rounding.

Capital expenditure in fical year 2023 totaled $5,224.4 compared to $4,650.0 in fical year 2022. The increae of $574.4 wa driven by pending for plant and equipment, which wa largely attributable to purchae aociated with our low- and zero-carbon hydrogen project, a well a ongoing maintenance capital pending. Higher pending for plant and equipment wa partially offet by lower invetment in and advance to unconolidated affiliate, a the econd phae of our invetment in JIGPC of $908 in fical year 2023 wa lower than the initial invetment of $1.6 billion completed in fical year 2022. Thee invetment included approximately $130 and $73 in fical year 2023 and 2022, repectively, received from a noncontrolling partner in one of our ubidiarie. We expect to complete a remaining invetment of approximately $115. Refer to Note 9, Equity Affiliate, to the conolidated financial tatement for additional information. Fical year 2023 alo included an invetment in financing receivable of $665.1, primarily for progre payment toward the purchae of a natural ga-to-ynga proceing facility in Uzbekitan. Refer to Note 5, Acquiition, to the conolidated financial tatement for additional information.
Outlook for Inveting Activitie
It i not poible, without unreaonable effort, to reconcile our forecated capital expenditure to future cah ued for inveting activitie becaue we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future invetment activity, which i driven by our aement of competing opportunitie at the time we enter into tranaction. Thee deciion, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a ignificant effect on our cah ued for inveting activitie.
We expect capital expenditure for fical year 2024 to be approximately $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion, which i driven by clean hydrogen and utainable aviation fuel project uch a thoe being executed in California and Louiiana, United State, a well a Alberta, Canada. We anticipate capital expenditure to be funded with our current cah balance, cah generated from continuing operation, and additional financing activitie.
A of the end of fical year 2023, we have committed capital of approximately $15 billion to project intended to accelerate the energy tranition. Thee low- and zero-carbon hydrogen and other firt mover project demontrate our commitment to making invetment that will make a meaningful difference on climate iue, allowing u to upport our cutomer utainability journey, conerve reource, and care for our employee and communitie.

Variou debt agreement to which we are a party include financial covenant and other retriction, including retriction pertaining to the ability to create property lien and enter into certain ale and leaeback tranaction. A of 30 September 2023, we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenant under our debt agreement.
2021 Credit Agreement
We have a five-year $2.75 billion revolving credit agreement maturing 31 March 2026 with a yndicate of bank (the 2021 Credit Agreement), under which enior unecured debt i available to u and certain of our ubidiarie. The 2021 Credit Agreement provide a ource of liquidity and upport our commercial paper program. No borrowing were outtanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement a of 30 September 2023. At thi time, we do not expect to acce the facility for additional liquidity.
The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement i a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization (equal to total debt plu total equity) not to exceed 70%. The 2021 Credit Agreement define total debt a the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedne, excluding limited recoure debt of any project finance ubidiary. Accordingly, thi calculation doe not conider borrowing aociated with NGHC. Total debt to total capitalization wa 36.6% and 35.8% a of 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022, repectively.
Foreign Credit Facilitie
We alo have credit facilitie available to certain of our foreign ubidiarie totaling $1,596.8, of which $1,041.4 wa borrowed and outtanding a of 30 September 2023. The amount borrowed and outtanding a of 30 September 2022 wa $457.5. The increae from 30 September 2022 wa driven by borrowing on a new variable-rate Saudi Riyal loan facility that mature in October 2026. The interet rate on the facility i baed on the Saudi Arabian Interbank Offered Rate plu an annual margin of 1.35%. We entered into thi facility in October 2022 and utilized a portion of the proceed to repay a variable-rate 4.10% Saudi Riyal Loan Facility of $195.6, which wa preented within long-term debt on our conolidated balance heet a of 30 September 2022.
NEOM Green Hydrogen Project Financing
In May 2023, NGHC ecured non-recoure project financing of approximately $6.1 billion, which i expected to fund approximately 73% of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project and will be drawn over the contruction period. At the ame time, NGHC ecured additional non-recoure credit facilitie totaling approximately $500 primarily for working capital need. A of 30 September 2023, the joint venture had borrowed $1.4 billion of the available financing. Refer to Note 3, Variable Interet Entitie, to the conolidated financial tatement for additional information.
Dividend
The Board of Director determine whether to declare cah dividend on our common tock and the timing and amount baed on financial condition and other factor it deem relevant. In fical year 2023, the Board of Director increaed the quarterly dividend to $1.75 per hare, repreenting an 8% increae, or $0.13 per hare, from the previou dividend of $1.62 per hare. We expect to continue increaing our quarterly dividend a we have done for the lat 41 conecutive year.
Dividend are paid quarterly, uually during the ixth week after the cloe of the fical quarter. On 21 July 2023, the Board of Director declared a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per hare that wa payable on 13 November 2023 to hareholder of record at the cloe of buine on 2 October 2023. On 15 November 2023, the Board of Director declared a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per hare that i payable on 12 February 2024 to hareholder of record at the cloe of buine on 2 January 2024.
Dicontinued Operation
In fical year 2023 and 2022, cah provided by operating activitie of dicontinued operation of $0.6 and $59.6, repectively, reulted from cah received a part of tate tax refund related to the ale of our former Performance Material Diviion in fical year 2017.
PENSION BENEFITS
We and certain of our ubidiarie ponor defined benefit penion plan and defined contribution plan that cover a ubtantial portion of our worldwide employee. The principal defined benefit penion plan are the U.S. alaried penion plan and the U.K. penion plan. Thee plan were cloed to new participant in 2005, after which defined contribution plan were offered to new employee. The hift to defined contribution plan i expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expene and contribution. For additional information, refer to Note 17, Retirement Benefit, to the conolidated financial tatement.
Net Periodic Cot (Benefit)
The table below ummarize the component of net periodic cot/benefit for our U.S. and international defined benefit penion plan for the fical year ended 30 September:
2023 2022
Service cot $23.2 $39.8
Non-ervice related cot (benefit)
86.8 (44.7)
Other 0.9 1.3
Net Periodic Cot (Benefit) $110.9 ($3.6)
Net periodic cot wa $110.9 in fical year 2023 veru a benefit of $3.6 in the prior year. The increaed cot from the prior year were primarily attributable to higher non-ervice cot, which were driven by higher interet cot and lower expected return on plan aet due to a maller beginning balance of plan aet. The net impact of non-ervice related item are reflected within "Other non-operating income (expene), net" on our conolidated income tatement.
Service cot reult from benefit earned by active employee and are reflected a operating expene primarily within "Cot of ale" and "Selling and adminitrative expene" on our conolidated income tatement. The amount of ervice cot capitalized in fical year 2023 and 2022 wa not material.
The table below ummarize the aumption ued in the calculation of net periodic cot/benefit for the fical year ended 30 September:
2023 2022
Weighted average dicount rate - Service cot 5.1 % 2.4 %
Weighted average dicount rate - Interet cot 5.3 % 2.0 %
Weighted average expected rate of return on plan aet 5.3 % 5.1 %
Weighted average expected rate of compenation increae 3.5 % 3.4 %
2024 Outlook
In fical year 2024, we expect to recognize penion expene of approximately $120 to $130 primarily driven by approximately $100 to $110 of non-ervice related cot, including lower etimated expected return on plan aet due to a maller beginning balance of plan aet and higher interet cot, partially offet by a decreae in actuarial lo amortization.
In fical year 2023, we recognized net actuarial loe of $4.4 in other comprehenive income. Actuarial gain and loe are amortized into penion expene over propective period to the extent they are not offet by future gain or loe. Future change in the dicount rate and actual return on plan aet could impact the actuarial gain or lo and reulting amortization in year beyond fical year 2024.
Penion Funding
Funded Statu
The projected benefit obligation repreent the actuarial preent value of benefit attributable to employee ervice rendered to date, including the effect of etimated future alary increae. The plan funded tatu i calculated a the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan aet at the end of the period.
The table below ummarize the projected benefit obligation, the fair value of plan aet, and the funded tatu for our U.S. and international plan a of 30 September:
2023 2022
Projected benefit obligation
$3,511.2 $3,588.3
Fair value of plan aet at end of year
3,433.0 3,526.0
Plan Funded Statu
($78.2) ($62.3)
The net unfunded liability of $78.2 a of 30 September 2023 increaed $15.9 from $62.3 a of 30 September 2022, a increae to the projected benefit obligation from the ervice and interet cot component of net period penion cot were greater than actuarial gain from higher dicount rate.
Company Contribution
Penion funding include both contribution to funded plan and benefit payment for unfunded plan, which are primarily non-qualified plan. With repect to funded plan, our funding policy i that contribution, combined with appreciation and earning, will be ufficient to pay benefit without creating unneceary urplue.
In addition, we make contribution to atify all legal funding requirement while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deduction attributable to plan contribution. With the aitance of third-party actuarie, we analyze the liabilitie and demographic of each plan, which help guide the level of contribution. During 2023 and 2022, our cah contribution to funded penion plan and benefit payment for unfunded penion plan were $32.6 and $44.7, repectively.
For fical year 2024, cah contribution to defined benefit plan are etimated to be $35 to $45. The etimate i baed on expected contribution to certain international plan and anticipated benefit payment for unfunded plan, which are dependent upon the timing of retirement. Actual future contribution will depend on future funding legilation, dicount rate, invetment performance, plan deign, and variou other factor.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Refer to Note 1, Bai of Preentation and Major Accounting Policie, and Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the conolidated financial tatement for a decription of our major accounting policie and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.
The accounting policie dicued below are thoe policie that we conider to be the mot critical to undertanding our financial tatement becaue they require management' mot difficult, ubjective, or complex judgment, often a the reult of the need to make etimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain. Thee etimate reflect our bet judgment about current and/or future economic and market condition and their effect baed on information available a of the date of our conolidated financial tatement. If condition change, actual reult may differ materially from thee etimate. Our management ha reviewed thee critical accounting policie and etimate and related dicloure with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Director.
Depreciable Live of Plant and Equipment
Plant and equipment, net at 30 September 2023 totaled $17,472.1, and depreciation expene totaled $1,325.8 during fical year 2023. Plant and equipment i recorded at cot and depreciated uing the traight-line method, which deduct equal amount of the cot of each aet from earning every year over it etimated economic ueful life.
Economic ueful life i the duration of time an aet i expected to be productively employed by u, which may be le than it phyical life. Aumption on the following factor, among other, affect the determination of etimated economic ueful life: wear and tear, obolecence, technical tandard, contract life, market demand, competitive poition, raw material availability, and geographic location.
The etimated economic ueful life of an aet i monitored to determine it appropriatene, epecially when buine circumtance change. For example, change in technology, change in the etimated future demand for product, exceive wear and tear, or unanticipated government action may reult in a horter etimated ueful life than originally anticipated. In thee cae, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new etimated remaining life, thereby increaing depreciation expene per year on a propective bai. Likewie, if the etimated ueful life i increaed, the adjutment to the ueful life decreae depreciation expene per year on a propective bai.
Our regional egment have numerou long-term cutomer upply contract for which we contruct an on-ite plant adjacent to or near the cutomer facility. Thee contract typically have initial contract term of 10 to 20 year. Depreciable live of the production aet related to long-term upply contract are generally matched to the contract live. Extenion to the contract term of upply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. A contract term are extended, the depreciable life of the aociated production aet i adjuted to match the new contract term, a long a it doe not exceed the remaining phyical life of the aet.
Our regional egment alo have contract for liquid or gaeou bulk upply and, for maller cutomer, packaged gae. The depreciable live of production facilitie aociated with thee contract are generally 15 year. Thee depreciable live have been determined baed on hitorical experience combined with judgment on future aumption uch a technological advance, potential obolecence, competitor action, etc.
In addition, we may purchae aet through tranaction accounted for a either an aet acquiition or a buine combination. Depreciable live are aigned to acquired aet baed on the age and condition of the aet, the remaining duration of long-term upply contract erved by the aet, and our hitorical experience with imilar aet. Management monitor it aumption and may potentially need to adjut depreciable life a circumtance change.
Impairment of Aet
There were no triggering event in fical year 2023 that would require impairment teting for any of our aet group, reporting unit that contain goodwill, or indefinite-lived intangible aet. We completed our annual impairment tet for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible aet and concluded there were no indication of impairment. Refer to the Impairment of Aet ubection below for additional detail.
Impairment of Aet: Plant and Equipment
Plant and equipment meeting the held for ale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value le cot to ell. Plant and equipment to be dipoed of other than by ale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering event, uch a unexpected contract termination or unexpected foreign government-impoed retriction or expropriation. Plant and equipment held for ue i grouped for impairment teting at the lowet level for which there i identifiable cah flow. Impairment teting of the aet group occur whenever event or change in circumtance indicate that the carrying amount of the aet may not be recoverable. Such circumtance may include:
a ignificant decreae in the market value of a long-lived aet grouping;
a ignificant advere change in the manner in which the aet grouping i being ued or in it phyical condition;
an accumulation of cot ignificantly in exce of the amount originally expected for the acquiition or contruction of the long-lived aet;
a reduction in revenue that i other than temporary;
a hitory of operating or cah flow loe aociated with the ue of the aet grouping; or
change in the expected ueful life of the long-lived aet.
If uch circumtance are determined to exit, an etimate of undicounted future cah flow produced by that aet group i compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exit. If an aet group i determined to be impaired, the lo i meaured baed on the difference between the aet group fair value and it carrying value. An etimate of the aet group fair value i baed on the dicounted value of it etimated cah flow.
The aumption underlying the undicounted future cah flow projection require ignificant management judgment. Factor that management mut etimate include indutry and market condition, ale volume and price, cot to produce, inflation, etc. The aumption underlying the cah flow projection repreent management bet etimate at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cah flow projection aociated with multiple potential future cenario. Change in key aumption or actual condition that differ from etimate could reult in an impairment charge. We ue reaonable and upportable aumption when performing impairment review and cannot predict the occurrence of future event and circumtance that could reult in impairment charge.
In fical year 2023, there wa no need to tet for impairment on any of our aet grouping a no event or change in circumtance indicated that the carrying amount of our aet grouping may not be recoverable.
Impairment of Aet: Goodwill
The acquiition method of accounting for buine combination require u to make ue of etimate and judgment to allocate the purchae price paid for acquiition to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible aet. Goodwill repreent the exce of the aggregate purchae price (plu the fair value of any noncontrolling interet and previouly held equity interet in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net aet of an acquired entity. Goodwill wa $861.7 a of 30 September 2023. Dicloure related to goodwill are included in Note 11, Goodwill, to the conolidated financial tatement.
We review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fical year and whenever event or change in circumtance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tet are done at the reporting unit level, which i defined a being equal to or one level below the operating egment for which dicrete financial information i available and whoe operating reult are reviewed by egment manager regularly. We have five reportable buine egment, even operating egment and 11 reporting unit, eight of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 25, Buine Segment and Geographic Information, for additional information. Reporting unit are primarily baed on product and ubregion within each reportable egment. The majority of our goodwill i aigned to reporting unit within our regional indutrial gae egment.
A part of the goodwill impairment teting, we have the option to firt ae qualitative factor to determine whether it i more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit i le than it carrying value. However, we chooe to bypa the qualitative aement and conduct quantitative teting to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceed it fair value. An impairment lo will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceed it fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially ue an income approach valuation model, repreenting the preent value of etimated future cah flow. Our valuation model ue a dicrete growth period and an etimated exit trading multiple. The income approach i an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intenive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our buine, and the relatively conitent cah flow generated by our reporting unit. The principal aumption utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit and/or adjuted EBITDA margin, dicount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rate and operating profit and/or adjuted EBITDA aumption are conitent with thoe utilized in our operating plan and/or revied forecat and long-term financial planning proce. The dicount rate aumption i calculated baed on an etimated market-participant rik-adjuted weighted-average cot of capital, which include factor uch a the rik-free rate of return, cot of debt, and expected equity premium. The exit multiple i determined from comparable indutry tranaction and where appropriate, reflect expected long-term growth rate.
If our initial review under the income approach indicate there may be impairment, we incorporate reult under the market approach to further evaluate the exitence of impairment. When the market approach i utilized, fair value i etimated baed on market multiple of revenue and earning derived from comparable publicly-traded indutrial gae companie and/or regional manufacturing companie engaged in the ame or imilar line of buine a the reporting unit, adjuted to reflect difference in ize and growth propect. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant fact and circumtance and make a qualitative aement to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment i required in the determination of each aumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual reult could differ from the etimate.
In the fourth quarter of fical year 2023, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment tet, noting no indication of impairment. The fair value of all our reporting unit ubtantially exceeded their carrying value.
Future event that could have a negative impact on the level of exce fair value over carrying value of the reporting unit include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakne, decline in market hare, pricing preure, inability to uccefully implement cot improvement meaure, increae to our cot of capital, change in the trategy of the reporting unit, and change to the tructure of our buine a a reult of future reorganization or divetiture of aet or buinee. Negative change in one or more of thee factor, among other, could reult in impairment charge.
Impairment of Aet: Intangible Aet
Intangible aet, net with determinable live at 30 September 2023 totaled $297.5 and conited primarily of cutomer relationhip, purchaed patent and technology, and land ue right. Thee intangible aet are teted for impairment a part of the long-lived aet grouping impairment tet. Impairment teting of the aet group occur whenever event or change in circumtance indicate that the carrying value of the aet may not be recoverable. See the impairment dicuion above under "Impairment of Aet - Plant and Equipment" for a decription of how impairment loe are determined.
Indefinite-lived intangible aet at 30 September 2023 totaled $37.1 and conited of trade name and trademark. Indefinite-lived intangible are ubject to impairment teting at leat annually or more frequently if event or change in circumtance indicate that potential impairment exit. The impairment tet for indefinite-lived intangible aet involve calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible aet and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value i le than the carrying value, the difference i recorded a an impairment lo. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty aving method, a form of the income approach. Thi method value an intangible aet by etimating the royaltie avoided through ownerhip of the aet.
Dicloure related to intangible aet other than goodwill are included in Note 12, Intangible Aet, to the conolidated financial tatement.
In the fourth quarter of fical year 2023, we conducted our annual impairment tet of indefinite-lived intangible, noting no indication of impairment.
Impairment of Aet: Equity Method Invetment
Invetment in and advance to equity affiliate totaled $4,617.8 at 30 September 2023. The majority of our equity method invetment are venture with other indutrial ga companie. Summarized financial information of our equity affiliate i included in Note 9, Equity Affiliate, to the conolidated financial tatement. We review our equity method invetment for impairment whenever event or change in circumtance indicate that the carrying amount of the invetment may not be recoverable.
An impairment lo i recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an invetment occur. We etimate the fair value of our invetment under the income approach, which conider the etimated dicounted future cah flow expected to be generated by the invetee, and/or the market approach, which conider market multiple of revenue and earning derived from comparable publicly-traded indutrial ga companie. Change in key aumption about the financial condition of an invetee or actual condition that differ from etimate could reult in an impairment charge.
In fical year 2023, there wa no need to tet any of our equity affiliate invetment for impairment a no event or change in circumtance indicated that the carrying amount of the invetment may not be recoverable.
Revenue Recognition: Cot Incurred Input Method
Revenue from equipment ale contract i generally recognized over time a we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract term doe not create an aet with alternative ue. We ue a cot incurred input method to recognize revenue by which cot incurred to date relative to total etimated cot at completion are ued to meaure progre toward atifying performance obligation. Cot incurred include material, labor, and overhead cot and repreent work contributing and proportionate to the tranfer of control to the cutomer.
Accounting for contract uing the cot incurred input method require management judgment relative to aeing rik and their impact on the etimate of revenue and cot. Our etimate are impacted by factor uch a the potential for incentive or penaltie on performance, chedule delay, technical iue, cot inflation, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the availability of material, and performance of ubcontractor. When adjutment in etimated total contract revenue or etimated total cot are required, any change in the etimated profit from prior etimate are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of uch change. When etimate of total cot to be incurred on a contract exceed etimate of total revenue to be earned, a proviion for the entire etimated lo on the contract i recorded in the period in which the lo i determined.
In addition to the typical rik aociated with underlying performance of engineering, project procurement, and contruction activitie, our ale of equipment project within our Corporate and other egment require monitoring of rik aociated with chedule, geography, and other apect of the contract and their effect on our etimate of total revenue and total cot to complete the contract.
Change in etimate on project accounted for under the cot incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $115 in fical year 2023 and $30 in fical year 2022.
We ae the performance of our ale of equipment project a they progre. Our earning could be poitively or negatively impacted by change to our contractual revenue and cot forecat on thee project.
Revenue Recognition: On-ite Cutomer Contract
For cutomer who require large volume of gae on a long-term bai, we produce and upply gae under long-term contract from large facilitie that we build, own, and operate on or near the cutomer facilitie. Certain of thee on-ite contract contain complex term and proviion regarding tolling arrangement, minimum payment requirement, variable component, pricing proviion, and amendment, which require ignificant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
Income Taxe
We account for income taxe under the aet and liability method. Under thi method, deferred tax aet and liabilitie are recognized for the tax effect of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bai of aet and liabilitie meaured uing enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to be recovered or ettled. A of 30 September 2023, accrued income taxe, including the amount recorded a noncurrent, wa $240.6, and net deferred tax liabilitie were $1,106.4. Tax liabilitie related to uncertain tax poition a of 30 September 2023 were $96.5, excluding interet and penaltie. Income tax expene for the fical year ended 30 September 2023 wa $551.2.
Management judgment i required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencie and the realization of deferred tax aet.
Actual income taxe paid may vary from etimate, depending upon change in income tax law, actual reult of operation, and the final audit of tax return by taxing authoritie. Tax aement may arie everal year after tax return have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilitie adequately provide for thee aement.
Deferred tax aet are recorded for operating loe and tax credit carryforward. However, when we do not expect ufficient ource of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating loe or tax credit carryforward, thee deferred tax aet are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance i recognized if, baed on the weight of available evidence, it i conidered more likely than not that ome portion or all of the deferred tax aet will not be realized. The factor ued to ae the likelihood of realization include forecated future taxable income and available tax planning trategie that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax aet in order to avoid the potential lo of future tax benefit. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance i reported in income tax expene.
A 1% increae or decreae in our effective tax rate may reult in a decreae or increae to net income, repectively, of approximately $29.
Dicloure related to income taxe are included in Note 23, Income Taxe, to the conolidated financial tatement.
Penion and Other Potretirement Benefit
The amount recognized in the conolidated financial tatement for penion and other potretirement benefit are determined on an actuarial bai utilizing numerou aumption. The dicuion that follow provide information on the ignificant aumption, expene, and obligation aociated with the defined benefit plan.
Actuarial model are ued in calculating the expene and liability related to the variou defined benefit plan. Thee model have an underlying aumption that the employee render ervice over their ervice live on a relatively conitent bai; therefore, the expene of benefit earned hould follow a imilar pattern.
Several aumption and tatitical variable are ued in the model to calculate the expene and liability related to the plan. We determine aumption about the dicount rate, the expected rate of return on plan aet, and the rate of compenation increae. Note 17, Retirement Benefit, to the conolidated financial tatement include dicloure of thee rate on a weighted-average bai for both the U.S. and international plan. The actuarial model alo ue aumption about demographic factor uch a retirement age, mortality, and turnover rate. Mortality rate are baed on the mot recent U.S. and international mortality table. We believe the actuarial aumption are reaonable. However, actual reult could vary materially from thee actuarial aumption due to economic event and difference in rate of retirement, mortality, and turnover.
One of the aumption ued in the actuarial model i the dicount rate ued to meaure benefit obligation. Thi rate reflect the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt intrument with maturitie correponding to the expected timing of benefit payment a of the annual meaurement date for each of the variou plan. We meaure the ervice cot and interet cot component of penion expene by applying pot rate along the yield curve to the relevant projected cah flow. The rate along the yield curve are ued to dicount the future cah flow of benefit obligation back to the meaurement date. Thee rate change from year to year baed on market condition that affect corporate bond yield. A higher dicount rate decreae the preent value of the benefit obligation and reult in lower penion expene. With repect to impact on penion benefit obligation, a 50 bp increae or decreae in the dicount rate may reult in a decreae or increae, repectively, to penion expene of approximately $15 per year.
The expected rate of return on plan aet repreent an etimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan aet reflecting current aet allocation. In determining etimated aet cla return, we take into account hitorical and future expected long-term return and the value of active management, a well a the interet rate environment. Aet allocation i determined baed on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteritic of the aet clae, the profile of the plan liabilitie, and acceptable level of rik. Lower return on the plan aet reult in higher penion expene. A 50 bp increae or decreae in the etimated rate of return on plan aet may reult in a decreae or increae, repectively, to penion expene of approximately $17 per year.
We ue a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain invetment gain or loe for our ignificant penion plan. Invetment gain or loe are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan aet. The expected return on plan aet i determined baed on a market-related value of plan aet. Thi i a calculated value that recognize invetment gain and loe on equitie over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduce year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity invetment equal the actual fair value. Expene in future period will be impacted a gain or loe are recognized in the market-related value of aet.
The expected rate of compenation increae i another key aumption. We determine thi rate baed on review of the underlying long-term alary increae trend characteritic of labor market and hitorical experience, a well a comparion to peer companie. A 50 bp increae or decreae in the expected rate of compenation may reult in an increae or decreae to penion expene, repectively, of approximately $4 per year.

In the normal coure of buine, we encounter contingencie, or ituation involving varying degree of uncertainty a to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for lo contingencie when it i conidered probable that a liability ha been incurred and the amount of lo can be reaonably etimated. When only a range of poible lo can be etablihed, the mot probable amount in the range i accrued. If no amount within thi range i a better etimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range i accrued.
Contingencie include thoe aociated with litigation and environmental matter, for which our accounting policy i dicued in Note 1, Bai of Preentation and Major Accounting Policie, to the conolidated financial tatement, and detail are provided in Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, to the conolidated financial tatement. Significant judgment i required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of lo aociated with a contingency can be reaonably etimated. Thee determination are made baed on the bet available information at the time. A additional information become available, we reae probability and etimate of lo contingencie. Reviion to the etimate aociated with lo contingencie could have a ignificant impact on our reult of operation in the period in which an accrual for lo contingencie i recorded or adjuted. For example, due to the inherent uncertaintie related to environmental expoure, a ignificant increae to environmental liabilitie could occur if a new ite i deignated, the cope of remediation i increaed, a different remediation alternative i identified, or our proportionate hare of the liability increae. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fine or damage award aociated with litigation could have a ignificant impact on our net income in the period in which it i recorded.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Dicloure About Market Rik
Our earning, cah flow, and financial poition are expoed to market rik ariing from fluctuation in interet rate and foreign currency exchange rate. It i our policy to minimize our cah flow expoure to advere change in currency exchange rate and to manage the financial rik inherent in funding with debt capital.
We addre thee financial expoure through a controlled program of rik management that include the ue of derivative financial intrument. We have etablihed counterparty credit guideline and generally enter into tranaction with financial intitution of invetment grade or better, thereby minimizing the rik of credit lo. All intrument are entered into for other than trading purpoe. For detail on the type and ue of thee derivative intrument and related major accounting policie, refer to Note 1, Bai of Preentation and Major Accounting Policie, and Note 14, Financial Intrument, to the conolidated financial tatement. Additionally, we mitigate advere energy price impact through our cot pa-through contract with cutomer and price increae.
Our derivative and other financial intrument conit of long-term debt, including the current portion and amount owed to related partie; interet rate wap; cro currency interet rate wap; and foreign exchange-forward contract. The net market value of thee financial intrument combined i referred to below a the "net financial intrument poition" and i dicloed in Note 15, Fair Value Meaurement, to the conolidated financial tatement. Our net financial intrument poition increaed from a liability of $6,898.6 at 30 September 2022 to a liability of $8,990.8 at 30 September 2023. The increae wa primarily due to NEOM Green Hydrogen Project financing and the iuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate note during the fical year.
The analyi below preent the enitivity of the market value of our financial intrument to elected change in market rate and price. Market value are the preent value of projected future cah flow baed on the market rate and price choen. The market value for interet rate rik and foreign currency rik are calculated by u uing a third-party oftware model that utilize tandard pricing model to determine the preent value of the intrument baed on market condition a of the valuation date, uch a interet rate, pot and forward exchange rate, and implied volatility.
Interet Rate Rik
Our debt portfolio a of 30 September 2023, including the effect of currency and interet rate wap agreement, wa compoed of 80% fixed-rate debt and 20% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio a of 30 September 2022, including the effect of currency and interet rate wap agreement, wa compoed of 79% fixed-rate debt and 21% variable-rate debt.
The enitivity analyi related to the interet rate rik on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio aume an intantaneou 100 bp parallel move in interet rate from the level at 30 September 2023, with all other variable held contant. A 100 bp increae in market interet rate would reult in a decreae of $728 and $364 in the net liability poition of financial intrument at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively. A 100 bp decreae in market interet rate would reult in an increae of $845 and $425 in the net liability poition of financial intrument at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively.
Baed on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interet rate wap agreement, a 100 bp increae in interet rate would reult in an additional $21 and $16 of interet incurred per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively. A 100 bp decline in interet rate would lower interet incurred by $21 and $16 per year at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Rik
The enitivity analyi related to foreign currency exchange rate aume an intantaneou 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rate from their level at 30 September 2023 and 2022, with all other variable held contant. A 10% trengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity veru all other currencie would reult in a decreae or increae, repectively, of $308 and $165 in the net liability poition of financial intrument at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively. The increae in enitivity i primarily due to the iuance of Euro-denominated fixed-rate note during the fical year.
The primary currency pair for which we have exchange rate expoure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinee Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cro currency interet rate wap, and foreign exchange-forward contract are ued in countrie where we do buine, thereby reducing our net aet expoure. Foreign exchange-forward contract and cro currency interet rate wap are alo ued to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cah flow. Thu, there i either an aet or liability or cah flow expoure related to all of the financial intrument in the above enitivity analyi for which the impact of a movement in exchange rate would be in the oppoite direction and materially equal to the impact on the intrument in the analyi.
The majority of our ale are denominated in foreign currencie a they are derived outide the United State. Therefore, financial reult will be affected by change in foreign currency rate. The Chinee Renminbi and the Euro repreent the larget expoure in term of our foreign earning. We etimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinee Renminbi or the Euro veru the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $55 and $20, repectively.

Conolidation Principle
We conolidate all entitie we control under either the voting interet model, which generally applie when we hold a majority of the voting interet of an entity, or the variable interet model, which applie to arrangement for which we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interet entity ("VIE").

Selling and Adminitrative Expene
The principal component of elling and adminitrative expene are cot related to compenation, adminitrative function, and profeional fee.
Potemployment Benefit
We provide ongoing benefit arrangement that provide nonretirement potemployment benefit uch a everance and outplacement ervice to involuntarily terminated employee. We record a liability for thee benefit when we determine it i probable that the benefit will be paid in an amount that can be reaonably etimated. Thee criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approve and commit to a termination plan that identifie impacted employee and their related benefit and i expected to be ubtantially completed within one year. We do not provide material one-time benefit arrangement.
Fair Value Meaurement
We are required to meaure certain aet and liabilitie at fair value, either upon initial meaurement or for ubequent accounting or reporting. For example, fair value i ued in the initial meaurement of aet and liabilitie acquired in a buine combination; on a recurring bai in the meaurement of derivative financial intrument; and on a nonrecurring bai when long-lived aet are written down to fair value when held for ale or determined to be impaired. Refer to Note 15, Fair Value Meaurement, and Note 17, Retirement Benefit, for information on the method and aumption ued in our fair value meaurement.
Financial Intrument
We addre certain financial expoure through a controlled program of rik management that include the ue of derivative financial intrument. The type of derivative financial intrument permitted for uch rik management program are pecified in policie et by management. Refer to Note 14, Financial Intrument, for further detail on the type and ue of derivative intrument into which we enter.
Major financial intitution are counterpartie to all of thee derivative contract. We have etablihed counterparty credit guideline and generally enter into tranaction with financial intitution of invetment grade or better. Management believe the rik of incurring loe related to credit rik i remote, and any loe would be immaterial to the conolidated financial reult, financial condition, or liquidity.
We recognize derivative on the balance heet at fair value. On the date the derivative intrument i entered into, we generally deignate the derivative a either (1) a hedge of a forecated tranaction or of the variability of cah flow to be received or paid related to a recognized aet or liability (cah flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net invetment in a foreign operation (net invetment hedge), or (3) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized aet or liability (fair value hedge).
The following detail the accounting treatment of our cah flow, fair value, net invetment, and non-deignated hedge:
Change in the fair value of a derivative that i deignated a and meet the cah flow hedge criteria are recorded in accumulated other comprehenive lo ("AOCL") to the extent effective and then recognized in earning when the hedged item affect earning.
Change in the fair value of a derivative that i deignated a and meet all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or lo on the hedged aet or liability that i attributable to the hedged rik, are recorded in current period earning.
Change in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are deignated a and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net invetment are recorded a tranlation adjutment in AOCL.
Change in the fair value of a derivative that i not deignated a a hedge are recorded immediately in earning.
We formally document the relationhip between hedging intrument and hedged item, a well a our rik management objective and trategy for undertaking variou hedge tranaction. Thi proce include relating derivative that are deignated a fair value or cah flow hedge to pecific aet and liabilitie on the balance heet or to pecific firm commitment or forecated tranaction. We alo formally ae, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing bai, whether derivative are highly effective in offetting change in fair value or cah flow of the hedged item. If it i determined that a derivative i not highly effective a a hedge, or if a derivative ceae to be a highly effective hedge, we will dicontinue hedge accounting with repect to that derivative propectively.
Foreign Currency
Since we do buine in many foreign countrie, fluctuation in currency exchange rate affect our financial poition and reult of operation.
In mot of our foreign operation, the local currency i conidered the functional currency. Foreign ubidiarie tranlate their aet and liabilitie into U.S. dollar at current exchange rate in effect a of the balance heet date. The gain or loe that reult from thi proce are hown a tranlation adjutment in AOCL in the equity ection of the balance heet.
The revenue and expene account of foreign ubidiarie are tranlated into U.S. dollar at the average exchange rate that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of thee item on the conolidated income tatement fluctuate from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar againt foreign currencie. Some tranaction are made in currencie different from an entity functional currency. Gain and loe from thee foreign currency tranaction, and the impact of related hedge, are generally reflected in "Other income (expene), net" on our conolidated income tatement a they occur and were not material for the period preented.
Foreign exchange gain and loe from the foreign currency remeaurement of balance aociated with intercompany and third-party financing tranaction, related income tax aet and liabilitie, and the impact of related hedge are reflected within Other non-operating income (expene), net" and were not material for the period preented.
In addition, foreign currency forward point and currency wap bai difference that are excluded from the aement of hedge effectivene of our cah flow hedge of intercompany loan (excluded component) are recorded within Other non-operating income (expene), net" on a traight-line bai. Excluded component were expene of $25.1, $23.2, and $31.0 in fical year 2023, 2022, and 2021, repectively.
Government Aitance
We receive, or expect to receive in the future, variou type of government aitance, primarily in the form of grant or refundable tax credit. Government aitance i recognized when there i reaonable aurance that we have complied with relevant condition and the aitance will be received.

Government aitance related to aet i included in the balance heet a a reduction of the cot of the aet and reult in reduced depreciation expene over the ueful life of the aet. Government aitance that relate to expene i recognized in the income tatement a a reduction of the related expene or a a component of other income (expene), net. Government aitance did not have a material impact on our financial tatement in fical year 2023.
Environmental Expenditure
Accrual for environmental lo contingencie are recorded when it i probable that a liability ha been incurred and the amount of lo can be reaonably etimated. Remediation cot are capitalized if the cot improve our property a compared with the condition of the property when originally contructed or acquired, or if the cot prevent environmental contamination from future operation. We expene environmental cot related to exiting condition reulting from pat or current operation and from which no current or future benefit i dicernible. The amount charged to income from continuing operation related to environmental matter totaled $24.9, $22.3, and $18.6 in fical year 2023, 2022, and 2021, repectively.
The meaurement of environmental liabilitie i baed on an evaluation of currently available information with repect to each individual ite and conider factor uch a exiting technology, preently enacted law and regulation, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated ite. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated ite might include, for example, a proviion for one or more of the following type of cot: ite invetigation and teting cot, remediation cot, pot-remediation monitoring cot, natural reource damage, and outide legal fee. Thee liabilitie include cot related to other potentially reponible partie to the extent that we have reaon to believe uch partie will not fully pay their proportionate hare. They do not conider any claim for recoverie from inurance or other partie and are not dicounted.
A aement and remediation progre at individual ite, the amount of projected cot i reviewed, and the liability i adjuted to reflect additional technical and legal information that become available. Management ha an etablihed proce in place to identify and monitor our environmental expoure. An environmental accrual analyi i prepared and maintained that lit all environmental lo contingencie, even where an accrual ha not been etablihed. Thi analyi ait in monitoring our overall environmental expoure and erve a a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among our technical expert, environmental manager, environmental lawyer, and financial management to enure that required accrual are recorded and potential expoure dicloed.
Due to inherent uncertaintie involved in evaluating environmental expoure, actual cot to be incurred at identified ite in future period may vary from the etimate. Refer to Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, for additional information on our environmental lo contingencie.
The accrual for environmental liabilitie are reflected in the conolidated balance heet, primarily a part of other noncurrent liabilitie.
Litigation
In the normal coure of buine, we are involved in legal proceeding. We accrue a liability for uch matter when it i probable that a liability ha been incurred and the amount of lo can be reaonably etimated. When only a range of poible lo can be etablihed, the mot probable amount in the range i accrued. If no amount within thi range i a better etimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range i accrued. The accrual for a litigation lo contingency include etimate of potential damage and other directly related cot expected to be incurred. Refer to Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, for additional information on our current legal proceeding.
Share-Baed Compenation
We expene the grant-date fair value of our hare-baed award over the veting period during which employee perform related ervice. Expene recognition i accelerated for retirement-eligible individual who would meet the requirement for veting of award upon their retirement. Refer to Note 20, Share-Baed Compenation, for additional information regarding our award, including the model and aumption ued to determine their grant-date fair value.
Income Taxe
We account for income taxe under the aet and liability method. Under thi method, deferred tax aet and liabilitie are recognized for the tax effect of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bae of aet and liabilitie uing enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to be recovered or ettled. A principal temporary difference reult from the exce of tax depreciation over book depreciation becaue accelerated method of depreciation and horter ueful live are ued for income tax purpoe. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rate or regulation i included in income tax expene in the period that include the enactment date. We recognize deferred tax aet net of exiting valuation allowance to the extent we believe that thee aet are more likely than not to be realized conidering all available evidence.
A tax benefit for an uncertain tax poition i recognized when it i more likely than not that the poition will be utained upon examination baed on it technical merit. Thi poition i meaured a the larget amount of tax benefit that i greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interet and penaltie related to unrecognized tax benefit are recognized a a component of income tax expene.

Short-term Invetment
"Short-term invetment" include time depoit and treaury ecuritie with original maturitie greater than three month and le than one year.
Credit Loe
We are expoed to credit loe primarily through ale of product and ervice. When extending credit, we evaluate cutomer creditworthine baed on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factor that include, but are not limited to, the cutomer credit core from external provider, financial condition, and pat payment experience.
We ae allowance for credit loe on our trade receivable, leae receivable, and financing receivable portfolio. Allowance are evaluated by portfolio on a collective bai where imilar characteritic exit. A proviion for cutomer default i made on a general formula bai a the rik of ome default i expected but cannot yet be aociated with pecific cutomer. The aement of the likelihood of default i baed on variou factor, including the length of time the receivable are pat due, hitorical experience, exiting economic condition, and forward-looking information. When we identify pecific cutomer with known collectability iue, the aement for credit loe i performed on an individual bai, conidering current and forward-looking information of the cutomer. We alo conider variable that may mitigate the inherent credit rik of a particular tranaction, uch a the etimated fair value of the collateral, whether by ue or ale.
The ue of forward-looking information conider economic condition that may affect the cutomer ability to pay. Although we hitorically have not experienced ignificant credit loe, our expoure to credit loe may increae if our cutomer are adverely affected by economic preure or uncertainty aociated with local or global economic receion, or other cutomer-pecific factor. We review our reerve for credit loe on a quarterly bai.
Trade receivable comprie amount owed to u through our operating activitie and are preented net of allowance for credit loe. Change to the carrying amount of the allowance for credit loe on trade receivable are ummarized below:

We write down our inventorie for etimated obolecence or unmarketable inventory baed upon aumption about future demand and market condition.
Equity Method Invetment
We apply the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercie ignificant influence but do not control the operating and financial deciion of an invetee, which generally applie when our ownerhip interet in common tock or in-ubtance common tock of the invetee i between 20% and 50%. Under the equity method, we initially record our invetment at cot and ubequently adjut the invetment to recognize our hare of net earning or loe, ditribution received, and other-than-temporary impairment. The carrying value of our equity method invetment i reflected a "Invetment in net aet of and advance to equity affiliate" on our conolidated balance heet. We ue the cumulative earning approach for determining cah flow preentation of cah ditribution received from equity method invetee.

Capitalized cot are reflected in "Plant and equipment, net" on the conolidated balance heet and are depreciated over the etimated ueful life of the oftware, generally a period of three to five year.
We capitalize cot incurred with the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement that i a ervice contract, conitent with our policy for oftware developed or obtained for internal ue. However, the capitalized cot are reflected in "Other noncurrent aet" on our conolidated balance heet and expened over the term of the related hoting arrangement.
Leae a Leee
A leee, we recognize a right-of-ue ("ROU") aet and leae liability on the balance heet for all leae with term in exce of 12 month. We evaluate whether an arrangement contain a leae at inception by determining whether there i an identifiable aet, we obtain ubtantially all the economic benefit from that aet, and we direct how and for what purpoe the aet i ued during the term of the arrangement. We apply a practical expedient to exclude arrangement with initial term of 12 month or le from our balance heet.
ROU aet repreent our right to ue an underlying aet for the leae term and leae liabilitie repreent our obligation to make leae payment ariing from the leae. ROU aet and leae liabilitie are recognized at the commencement date baed on the preent value of leae payment over the leae term. Since our leae generally do not provide an implicit dicount rate, we ue our incremental borrowing rate baed on the information available at the commencement date in determining the preent value of leae payment. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, we conider our unecured borrowing and publihed market rate, and then adjut thoe rate to aume full collateralization and to factor in the individual leae term, geography, and payment tructure.
Our leae term include period covered by option to extend or terminate the leae when it i reaonably certain that we will exercie an option to extend or not exercie an option to terminate. Leae payment conider our practical expedient to combine amount for leae and related non-leae component for all clae of underlying aet in which we are leee. Fixed payment and payment aociated with ecalation claue baed on an index are included in the ROU aet and leae liability at commencement. Variable leae payment are excluded from the ROU aet and leae liabilitie and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for thoe payment i incurred. Our variable leae payment primarily include the impact from ecalation claue that are not fixed or baed on an index. Prepaid leae payment are included in the recognition of ROU aet. Our leae agreement do not contain any material leae incentive, reidual value guarantee or retriction or covenant.

Revenue repreenting interet income from the financing component of the leae receivable i reflected a ale over the life of the contract.
In cae for which operating leae treatment i appropriate, there i no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract a compared to accounting for the contract under a ale of ga agreement. Thee contract qualify for a practical expedient available to leor to combine the leae and non-leae component and account for the combined component in accordance with the accounting treatment for the predominant component. We elected to apply thi practical expedient and have accounted for the combined component a product ale under the revenue tandard a we control the operation and maintenance of the aet that provide the upply of ga to our cutomer.
A we generally control the operation and maintenance of the aet that provide the upply of ga to our cutomer, there have been no new arrangement that qualified a a leae in fical year 2023.
Financing Receivable
Some of our acquiition include term that provide the eller with both the right to receive all output from the acquired aet for an agreed upon term a well a the right to reacquire the aet at a future date. In thee intance, we evaluate the contract term to determine whether we have obtained control of the underlying aet, or the tranaction qualifie a a financing arrangement. For tranaction that qualify a financing arrangement, we record our invetment a a financing receivable, net of any allowance for credit loe, on our conolidated balance heet. We then recognize a portion of the payment received a a reduction to the financing receivable. Related interet income i preented within Sale on our conolidated income tatement with revenue received to operate the plant. Interet income on our financing receivable wa not material in fical year 2023.
Impairment of Long-Lived Aet
Long-lived aet are grouped for impairment teting at the lowet level for which there are identifiable cah flow that are largely independent of the cah flow of other aet and liabilitie. Long-lived aet are evaluated for impairment whenever event or change in circumtance indicate that the carrying amount of an aet group may not be recoverable. We ae recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the aet group to etimated undicounted future cah flow expected to be generated by the aet group. If an aet group i conidered impaired, the impairment lo to be recognized i meaured a the amount by which the aet group carrying amount exceed it fair value. Long-lived aet meeting the held for ale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value le cot to ell.
Aet Retirement Obligation
The fair value of a liability for an aet retirement obligation i recognized in the period in which it i incurred. The fair value of the liability i meaured uing dicounted etimated cah flow and i adjuted to it preent value in ubequent period a accretion expene i recorded. The correponding aet retirement cot are capitalized a part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived aet and depreciated over the aet ueful life. Our aet retirement obligation are primarily aociated with on-ite long-term upply contract under which we have built a facility on land owned by the cutomer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. Our aet retirement obligation totaled $297.3 and $274.7 at 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively. Refer to Note 18, Commitment and Contingencie, for further detail.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project
In the fourth quarter of fical year 2020, we announced the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project (the "NEOM project), a multi-billion dollar green hydrogen-baed ammonia production facility that will be powered by renewable energy in NEOM City, Saudi Arabia. We, along with our joint venture partner, ACWA Power and NEOM Company, are equal owner in NGHC, which will develop, contruct, own, operate, and finance the project.
During the third quarter of fical year 2022, we entered into an interim agreement with NGHC under which we commenced contruction of the NEOM project. In addition, we executed an agreement with NGHC under which we will be the excluive offtaker of green ammonia produced by the NEOM project under a long-term take-if-tendered agreement. We intend to tranport the green ammonia around the world to be diociated to produce green hydrogen for tranportation and indutrial market. In May 2023, NGHC finalized the $6.7 billion engineering, procurement, and contruction ("EPC") agreement with Air Product named a the main contractor and ytem integrator for the facility. A of 30 September 2023, we had unconditional purchae obligation of approximately $5 billion for open purchae order related to contruction of the project.
Air Product ha one-third of the voting interet in the NGHC joint venture; however, ubtantially all the activitie of the joint venture involve or are conducted on behalf of Air Product. Since we have diproportionately few voting right relative to our economic interet in the joint venture, we determined that NGHC i a variable interet entity. In addition, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of NGHC ince we have the power to unilaterally direct certain ignificant activitie, including key deign and contruction deciion, and we hare power with our joint venture partner related to other activitie that are ignificant to the economic performance of NGHC. Therefore, we conolidate NGHC within the Middle Eat and India egment.
Project Financing
In May 2023, NGHC ecured non-recoure project financing of approximately $6.1 billion, which i expected to fund about 73% of the project and will be drawn over the contruction period. At the ame time, NGHC ecured additional non-recoure credit facilitie totaling approximately $500 primarily for working capital need. Under the financing, the aet of NGHC can only be ued to ettle obligation of the joint venture, and creditor of NGHC do not have recoure to the general credit of Air Product.

6. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Nature of Good and Service
The principal activitie from which we generate ale from our contract with cutomer are decribed below with their repective revenue recognition policie. For an overall ummary of thee policie and dicuion on payment term and preentation, refer to Note 1, Bai of Preentation and Major Accounting Policie.
Regional Indutrial Gae
Our regional indutrial gae buinee produce and ell atmopheric gae uch a oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic ditillation of air) and proce gae uch a hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ynga, and pecialty gae. We ditribute gae to our ale of ga cutomer through different upply mode depending on variou factor including the cutomer' volume requirement and location. Our upply mode are a follow:
On-ite Gae-Supply mode aociated with cutomer who require large volume of gae and have relatively contant demand. Gae are produced and upplied by large facilitie on or near the cutomer facilitie or by pipeline ytem from centrally located production facilitie. Thee ale of ga contract generally have 15- to 20-year term. We alo deliver maller quantitie of product through mall on-ite plant (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generator), typically via 10- to 15-year ale of ga contract. The contract within thi upply mode generally contain fixed monthly charge and/or minimum purchae requirement with price ecalation proviion that are generally baed on external indice. Revenue aociated with thi upply mode i generally recognized over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon quantity of good.
Merchant Gae-Supply mode aociated with liquid bulk and packaged gae cutomer. Liquid bulk cutomer receive delivery of product in liquid or gaeou form by tanker or tube trailer. The product i tored, uually in it liquid tate, in equipment we typically deign and intall at the cutomer ite for vaporizing into a gaeou tate a needed. Packaged gae cutomer receive mall quantitie of product delivered in either cylinder or dewar. Both liquid bulk and packaged gae ale do not contain minimum purchae requirement a they are governed by contract and/or purchae order that are baed on the cutomer' requirement. Thee contract contain tated term that are generally five year or le. Performance obligation aociated with thi upply mode are atified at a point in time when the cutomer receive and obtain control of the product, which generally occur upon delivery.
The timing of revenue recognition for our regional indutrial gae buinee i generally conitent with our right to invoice the cutomer. Variable component of conideration that may not be reolved within the month, uch a the ability to earn an annual bonu or incur a penalty, are more relevant to on-ite contract and are conidered contrained a they can be impacted by a ingle ignificant event uch a a plant outage, which could occur at the end of a contract period. We conider contract modification on an individual bai to determine appropriate accounting treatment. However, contract modification are generally accounted for propectively a they relate to ditinct good or ervice aociated with future period of performance.
We mitigate energy and natural ga price rik contractually through pricing formula, urcharge, and cot pa-through arrangement.
Equipment
We deign and manufacture equipment for air eparation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural ga liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen tranport and torage. The Corporate and other egment erve our ale of equipment cutomer.
Our ale of equipment contract are generally compried of a ingle performance obligation a the individual promied good or ervice contained within the contract are integrated with or dependent upon other good or ervice in the contract for a ingle output to the cutomer. Revenue from our ale of equipment contract i generally recognized over time a we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract term doe not create an aet with alternative ue. Otherwie, ale of equipment contract are atified at the point in time the cutomer obtain control of the equipment, which i generally determined baed on the hipping term of the contract. For contract recognized over time, we primarily recognize revenue uing a cot incurred input method by which cot incurred to date relative to total etimated cot at completion are ued to meaure progre toward atifying performance obligation. Cot incurred include thoe for material, labor, and overhead and repreent work contributing and proportionate to the tranfer of control to the cutomer.
Since our contract are generally compried of a ingle performance obligation, contract modification are typically accounted for a part of the exiting contract and are recognized a a cumulative adjutment for the inception-to-date effect of uch change. In addition, change in etimate on project accounted for under the cot incurred input method are recognized a a cumulative adjutment for the inception-to-date effect of uch change. We recorded change to project etimate that unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $115, $30, and $19 in fical year 2023, 2022, and 2021, repectively.

Penion contribution to funded plan and benefit payment for unfunded plan for fical year 2023 were $32.6. Contribution for funded plan reulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirement. Benefit payment to unfunded plan were due primarily to the timing of retirement. We anticipate contributing $35 to $45 to the defined benefit penion plan in fical year 2024. Thee contribution are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and regulatory requirement for funded plan and benefit payment for unfunded plan, which are dependent upon timing of retirement.

Thee etimated benefit payment are baed on aumption about future event. Actual benefit payment may vary ignificantly from thee etimate.
Defined Contribution Plan
We maintain a non-leveraged employee tock ownerhip plan ("ESOP") which form part of the Air Product and Chemical, Inc. Retirement Saving Plan ("RSP"). The ESOP wa etablihed in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP i a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A ubtantial portion of U.S. employee are eligible and participate.
We treat dividend paid on ESOP hare a ordinary dividend. Under exiting tax law, we may deduct dividend which are paid with repect to hare held by the plan. Share of our common tock in the ESOP totaled 1,822,509 a of 30 September 2023.
Our contribution to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employee who do not receive their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit penion plan, with the core contribution baed on a percentage of pay that i dependent on year of ervice. For the RSP, we alo make matching contribution on overall employee contribution a a percentage of the employee contribution and include an enhanced contribution for certain eligible employee that do not participate in the defined benefit penion plan.

The net actuarial gain recognized in accumulated other comprehenive lo on a pretax bai wa $2.4 and $4.5 a of 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively.
18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
We are involved in variou legal proceeding, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and inurance matter. We do not currently believe there are any legal proceeding, individually or in the aggregate, that are reaonably poible to have a material impact on our financial condition, reult of operation, or cah flow.
In September 2010, the Brazilian Adminitrative Council for Economic Defene ("CADE") iued a deciion againt our Brazilian ubidiary, Air Product Brail Ltda., and everal other Brazilian indutrial ga companie for alleged anticompetitive activitie. CADE impoed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $36 at 30 September 2023) on Air Product Brail Ltda. Thi fine wa baed on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Minitry of Jutice, following an invetigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition law with repect to the ale of indutrial and medical gae. The fine are baed on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.
We have denied the allegation made by the authoritie and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian court. On 6 May 2014, our appeal wa granted and the fine againt Air Product Brail Ltda. wa dimied. CADE ha appealed that ruling and the matter remain pending. We, with advice of our outide legal counel, have aeed the tatu of thi matter and have concluded that, although an advere final judgment after exhauting all appeal i poible, uch a judgment i not probable. A a reult, no proviion ha been made in the conolidated financial tatement. In the event of an advere final judgment, we etimate the maximum poible lo to be the full amount of the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $36 at 30 September 2023) plu interet accrued thereon until final dipoition of the proceeding.
Additionally, in April 2023, we received a favorable ruling from a Texa tate court in litigation involving diputed energy management charge related to Winter Storm Uri, a evere winter weather torm that impacted the U.S. Gulf Coat in February 2021. The ruling i ubject to appeal and had no impact on our conolidated financial tatement for the twelve month ended 30 September 2023.
Environmental
In the normal coure of buine, we are involved in legal proceeding under the Comprehenive Environmental Repone, Compenation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law), Reource Conervation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and imilar tate and foreign environmental law relating to the deignation of certain ite for invetigation or remediation. Preently, there are 27 ite on which a final ettlement or remediation ha not been achieved where we, uually along with other, have been deignated a potentially reponible party by environmental authoritie or are otherwie engaged in invetigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing ite. We continually monitor thee ite for which we have environmental expoure.
Accrual for environmental lo contingencie are recorded when it i probable that a liability ha been incurred and the amount of lo can be reaonably etimated. The conolidated balance heet at 30 September 2023 and 30 September 2022 included an accrual of $64.5 and $71.3, repectively, primarily a part of other noncurrent liabilitie. The environmental liabilitie will be paid over a period of up to 26 year. We etimate the expoure for environmental lo contingencie to range from $64 to a reaonably poible upper expoure of $78 a of 30 September 2023.
Actual cot to be incurred at identified ite in future period may vary from the etimate, given inherent uncertaintie in evaluating environmental expoure. Uing reaonably poible alternative aumption of the expoure level could reult in an increae to the environmental accrual. Due to the inherent uncertaintie related to environmental expoure, a ignificant increae to the reaonably poible upper expoure level could occur if a new ite i deignated, the cope of remediation i increaed, a different remediation alternative i identified, or a ignificant increae in our proportionate hare occur. We do not expect that any um we may have to pay in connection with environmental matter in exce of the amount recorded or dicloed above would have a material advere impact on our financial poition or reult of operation in any one year.
Pace
At 30 September 2023, $37.3 of the environmental accrual wa related to the Pace facility.
In 2006, we old our Amine buine, which included operation at Pace, Florida, and recognized a liability for retained environmental obligation aociated with remediation activitie at Pace. We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ("FDEP") and the United State Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") to continue our remediation effort. We recognized a before-tax expene of $42 in fical year 2006 in reult from dicontinued operation and recorded an environmental accrual of $42 in continuing operation on the conolidated balance heet.
During the econd quarter of fical year 2020, we completed an updated cot review of the environmental remediation tatu at the Pace facility. The review wa completed in conjunction with requirement to maintain financial aurance per the Conent Order iued by the FDEP dicued below. Baed on our review, we expect ongoing activitie to continue for 30 year. Additionally, we will require near-term pending to intall new groundwater recovery well and ancillary equipment, in addition to future capital to conider the extended time horizon for remediation at the ite. A a reult of thee change, we increaed our environmental accrual for thi ite by $19 in continuing operation on the conolidated balance heet and recognized a before-tax expene of $19 in reult from dicontinued operation in the econd quarter of fical year 2020. There have been no ignificant change to the etimated expoure range related to the Pace facility ince the econd quarter of fical year 2020.
We have implemented many of the remedial corrective meaure at the Pace facility required under 1995 Conent Order iued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated oil have been bioremediated, and the treated oil have been ecured in a lined on-ite corrective action management unit. Several groundwater recovery ytem have been intalled to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extenive aement of the ite to determine the efficacy of exiting meaure, what additional corrective meaure may be needed, and whether newer remediation technologie that were not available in the 1990 might be uitable to more quickly and effectively remediate groundwater. Baed on aement reult, we completed a focued feaibility tudy that ha identified alternative approache that may more effectively remove contaminant. We continue to review alternative remedial approache with the FDEP and completed additional field work during 2021 to upport the deign of an improved groundwater recovery network with the objective of targeting area of higher contaminant concentration and avoiding area of high groundwater iron which ha proven to be a ignificant operability iue for the project. The deign of the optimized recovery ytem wa initiated in fical year 2023 with contruction expected to begin in fical year 2025. In the firt quarter of 2015, we entered into a new Conent Order with the FDEP requiring u to continue our remediation effort at the Pace facility, along with the completion of a cot review every 5 year.
Piedmont
At 30 September 2023, $4.5 of the environmental accrual wa related to the Piedmont ite.
On 30 June 2008, we old our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilitie and the related North American atmopheric emulion and global preure enitive adheive buinee. In connection with the ale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligation aociated with remediation activitie at the Piedmont ite. Thi ite i under active remediation for contamination caued by an inolvent prior owner.
We are required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control ("SCDHEC") to addre both contaminated oil and groundwater. Numerou area of oil contamination have been addreed, and contaminated groundwater i being recovered and treated. The SCDHEC iued it final approval to the ite-wide feaibility tudy on 13 June 2017 and the Record of Deciion for the ite on 27 June 2018, after which we igned a Conent Agreement Amendment memorializing our obligation to complete the cleanup of the ite. Remediation ha tarted in accordance with the deign, which include in-itu chemical oxidation treatment, a well a oil vapor extraction to remove volatile organic compound from the unaturated oil beneath the impacted area of the plant. We etimate that ource area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2029. Thereafter, we expect thi ite to go into a tate of monitored natural attenuation through 2047.
We recognized a before-tax expene of $24 in 2008 a a component of income from dicontinued operation and recorded an environmental liability of $24 in continuing operation on the conolidated balance heet. There have been no ignificant change to the etimated expoure.
Paadena
At 30 September 2023, $10.5 of the environmental accrual wa related to the Paadena ite.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, management committed to permanently hutting down our polyurethane intermediate ("PUI") production facility in Paadena, Texa. In hutting down and dimantling the facility, we have undertaken certain obligation related to oil and groundwater contaminant. We have been pumping and treating groundwater to control off-ite contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirement and under the approval of the Texa Commiion on Environmental Quality ("TCEQ"). We etimate that the pump and treat ytem will continue to operate until 2042.
We continue to perform additional work to addre other environmental obligation at the ite. Thi additional work include remediating, a required, impacted oil, invetigating groundwater wet of the former PUI facility, continuing pot cloure care for two cloed RCRA urface impoundment unit, and maintaining engineering control. Additionally, we have conducted an interim corrective action to treat impacted oil a recommended in the TCEQ 2019 Annual Report. In 2012, we etimated the total expoure at thi ite to be $13. There have been no ignificant change to the etimated expoure.
Aet Retirement Obligation
Our aet retirement obligation are primarily aociated with long-term on-ite upply contract under which we have built a facility on land owned by the cutomer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The retirement of aet include the contractually required removal of a long-lived aet from ervice and encompae the ale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or dipoal of the aet a required at the end of the contract term. Thee obligation are primarily reflected within "Other noncurrent liabilitie" on the conolidated balance heet. The timing and/or method of ettlement of thee obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.

Deferred Tax Aet and Liabilitie
The ignificant component of deferred tax aet and liabilitie are a follow:

Deferred Tax Liabilitie
Deferred income taxe 1,266.0 1,247.4
Net Deferred Income Tax Liability $1,106.4 $1,111.7
Deferred tax liabilitie related to "Intangible aet" decreaed primarily due to the impact of capitalizing reearch and development expenditure for U.S tax purpoe. Deferred tax liabilitie related to "Plant and equipment" increaed due to the impact of accelerated tax depreciation deduction in exce of book depreciation, primarily in the United State. The increae wa partially offet with book charge in exce of tax related to our buine and aet action that included certain cot for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were ubject to a valuation allowance.
Deferred tax aet for "Tax lo carryforward" increaed primarily due to loe in certain Chinee ubidiarie. A portion of thee loe were ubject to a valuation allowance for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit. The deferred tax component for "Reerve and accrual" and "Other" were impacted by change in tax deferred deduction and the timing of revenue recognition for local tax and accounting purpoe.
A of 30 September 2023, we had the following deferred tax aet for certain tax credit:
Juridiction Gro Tax Aet Expiration Period
U.S. State $2.0 2024 - 2036
U.S. Federal 20.9 2030 - 2033

Of the $17.7 credit in foreign juridiction, $16.0 have indefinite carryforward period.
A of 30 September 2023, we had the following lo carryforward:
Juridiction Gro Lo Carryforward Expiration Period
U.S. State Net Operating Lo $237.1 2024 - 2040
U.S. State Capital Lo 35.2 2025 - 2027

Foreign Net Operating Lo 325.9 2024 - 2038; Indefinite
Foreign Capital Lo 197.8 Indefinite
Of the $325.9 of foreign net operating lo carryforward, $128.9 have indefinite carryforward period.
The valuation allowance wa $153.3 and $100.1 a of 30 September 2023 and 2022, repectively. A of 30 September 2023, the balance primarily related to $33.6 of foreign credit and lo carryforward, $18.7 of U.S. federal foreign income tax credit, $49.4 related to foreign capital loe, and $34.7 related to other charge from our Buine and Aet Action. If event warrant the reveral of the valuation allowance, it would reult in a reduction of tax expene. We believe it i more likely than not that future earning and reveral of deferred tax liabilitie will be ufficient to utilize our deferred tax aet, net of exiting valuation allowance, a of 30 September 2023.
Our U.S. federal and U.S. tate capital loe primarily related to a lo realized upon the divetiture of our Ruian ubidiary in fical year 2022. We believe it i more likely than not that we will recognize ufficient U.S. capital gain income in the future to utilize our capital loe before expiration.
We record income taxe on the unditributed earning of our foreign ubidiarie and corporate joint venture unle thoe earning are indefinitely reinveted. Such earning may be ubject to foreign withholding and other taxe. The cumulative unditributed earning that are conidered to be indefinitely reinveted in foreign ubidiarie and corporate joint venture are included in retained earning on the conolidated balance heet and amounted to $8.0 billion a of 30 September 2023. An etimated $749.0 in additional foreign withholding and other income taxe would be due if thee earning were remitted a dividend.

In fical year 2022, reerve for unrecognized tax benefit decreaed $25.5 due to tatute of limitation expiration. We releaed reerve of $17.2 related to the ale of PMD. Upon releae of the reerve, we recorded income tax benefit of $14.8 a a component of dicontinued operation. The PMD reerve wa net of related deferred tax aet of $2.4. In fical year 2023 we releaed an additional $5.2 of reerve related to the ale of PMD. Fical year 2022 alo reflect a $15.4 reduction for tax poition of prior year. Thi wa primarily due to a $10.6 reduction caued by change to income tax rate.
