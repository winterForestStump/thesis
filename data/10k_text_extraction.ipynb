BUSINESS       Harris Interactive Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1997. Harris Interactive Inc. and its subsidiaries (also herein referred to as \"Harris Interactive\", \"we\", \"our\", \"us\", or the \"Company\") is a worldwide market research and consulting firm best known for The Harris Poll(R), and for pioneering the Internet method to conduct scientifically accurate market research. Harris Interactive combines proprietary methodologies and technology with expertise in predictive, custom and strategic research. The Company conducts international research through its various U.S. offices, its wholly-owned subsidiaries: London- based HI Europe (www.hieurope.com) and Tokyo-based Harris Interactive Japan K.K. (www.hpol.co.jp) -- as well as through its Global Network of local market and opinion research firms.       On November 1, 2001 Harris Interactive acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Total Research Corporation, a Delaware corporation, located in Princeton, New Jersey. The transaction was completed pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 5, 2001, among the Company, Total Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Total Research. Total Merger Sub was merged with and into Total Research (the \"Merger\"), with Total Research continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.       The Company has its corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York. The Company\\'s fiscal year ends June 30th. Information about the Company\\'s products and services, shareholder information, press releases, and SEC filings can be found on the Company\\'s website at www.harrisinteractive.com. We make available free of charge through our website the documents and reports we file with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Information on our website (or the websites of our subsidiaries) does not constitute part of this Report on Form 10-K.  OVERVIEW       The Company operates as one business segment, and services its clients through six distinct operating groups:       - Business and Consumer Research,       - Health Care & Policy Research,       - Customer Loyalty Management,       - HI Europe,       - Harris Interactive Japan, and                                          3        - Harris Interactive Service Bureau.       The operating groups conduct:       - custom research -- internet-based and traditional studies conducted on        specific issues for specific customers,       - multi-client research -- internet-based studies conducted on issues of        general interest and sold to numerous clients, and       - service bureau research -- internet-based data collection conducted for        other research firms.       In 1997, the Company embarked on its mission to develop an Internet panel and the proprietary technology infrastructure necessary to conduct fast, comprehensive and accurate online market research. Accordingly, we have made, and will continue to make, significant expenditures to drive the transformation of the market research and polling industry to an Internet-based platform. We believe that Harris Interactive is the leading Internet-based market research and polling firm in the world, based on the size of our Internet panel, the number of online surveys that we have completed and the amount of revenue we derive from online research.       The Company operates telephone data collection centers in Rochester, New York, London, England, and Tokyo, Japan. The Company\\'s phone centers conduct interviews utilizing computer-based questionnaires. The data are immediately uploaded to the Company\\'s central data-processing center, thereby enabling more efficient and effective analysis. The Company\\'s phone centers have sufficient capacity to support reasonably predictable long-term needs. The Company also out-sources telephone data collection to support shorter-term project needs and others that exceed the Company\\'s internal capacity.       The Company maintains secure in-house data processing operations that provide rapid data management and analysis. The Company supports many platforms and file types both to exchange data and to provide clients with extensive database design and management capabilities. The Company also provides its clients with sample management services and survey data results using a variety of software applications.

OUR MARKET OPPORTUNITY    GENERAL OVERVIEW       Business is becoming more complex. Heightened competition, consolidation, globalization of product markets, accelerated product launch schedules, shortened product life and rapidly changing consumer preferences mark today\\'s business environment. This complexity has escalated the value of accurate and timely information needed to make critical decisions. Business covets data about the preferences, needs, buying behavior and brand awareness of existing and potential clients. Well-managed companies also need to continuously track product performance and competitive position, monitor consumer satisfaction and loyalty, measure advertising effectiveness and determine price sensitivity.       Historically, market research has been performed using traditional data collection methodologies: telephone, mail and in-person interviews. However, these methods are becoming increasingly less effective (and less affordable) due to high data collection costs, small sample sizes and the extensive time required to perform the research. Consequently, large traditional research projects can only be funded by organizations with significant resources. The Internet has dramatically changed the market research and polling industry, making it possible for the first time to survey a broad, diverse population at costs and speeds that were previously unattainable. This capacity has actually increased the amount of research that is being completed as much of our revenue is \"new\" research that had never been done before.                                          4   THE INTERNET AND ITS IMPACT ON THE MARKET RESEARCH AND POLLING INDUSTRY       Since its conception in the early 1960s, the Internet has enabled hundreds of millions of people worldwide to gather and share information as well as conduct business electronically. The use of the Internet as a market research and polling tool is still in its relatively early stages, having only been practiced for the last five to seven years.       Harris Interactive first began testing the Internet to conduct market research and polling in 1997. At that time, there were approximately 40 million people, or only about 16% of the U.S. population, who had Internet access. They were not representative of the general population. Harris Interactive had to perfect data weighting systems to correct for this bias. Today, the demographic composition of Internet users has become closer to the overall population and highly accurate weighting procedures have been developed, making the Internet a viable means to conduct market research -- with significant advantages, including:       - FLEXIBILITY -- Internet-based market research is conducted on the        respondent\\'s schedule -- not the telephone researcher\\'s schedule. Online        questionnaires may be completed at home, work or anyplace with Internet        access. Surveys can be created in multiple languages and administered        around the world seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.       - VERSATILITY -- Motion and still pictures, graphics, advertising copy and        other visual materials can be viewed over the Internet, a feature not        available with telephone sampling. The images can be combined with sound        as well as protected from being stolen, printed, forwarded, copied or        saved. Internet-based methodology allows questions and their sequence in        surveys to be modified as panelists respond. Mail surveys, in contrast,        are limited to the order and content of the printed text of the survey.        Online qualitative research techniques such as chat room or bulletin        board focus groups provide substantial savings in time and travel costs.       - SPEED -- In our experience, an average mail survey takes approximately        six weeks from design to completion. In contrast, Internet surveys can        generally be completed in two to seven days. As voicemail, caller ID,        call screening answering machines, do-not-call protection, and a general        aversion to telemarketing proliferate, call acceptance rates drop and        telephone researchers must call more people to get the same number of        completed surveys. Therefore, the speed (and cost) advantage of the        Internet model actually becomes greater as the sample size increases.       - VALUE -- Internet-based methodology offers significant cost benefits when        compared to traditional market research methodologies. Traditional survey        sample size is limited due to the high data collection costs per        response. Internet-based market research methods can provide larger and        more robust sample sizes for the same cost, or the same sample size can        be gathered at a reduced cost.       - PRODUCTIVITY -- Because online panelists can read questions faster than        they can listen, more questions can be asked in the same amount of time.        Respondents in qualitative sessions conducted online create their own        transcripts, which can be immediately reviewed and analyzed by the market        researcher- versus having to create transcriptions from audiotapes.  THE HARRIS INTERACTIVE ADVANTAGE       We believe that Harris Interactive is the global leader in online market research. We offer our clients a broad suite of Internet-based market research and polling products. We have several competitive advantages that we believe will enable us to maintain and expand our lead position in Internet-based research. Our key competitive advantages include:       - HIGHLY SATISFIED AND LOYAL CLIENTS. Our intensive measurement of customer        satisfaction and the associated process improvements have allowed us to        greatly improve the quality of services that we deliver. All of our        researchers and managers are evaluated on the customer satisfaction        scores that they earn from their clients, and their bonus compensation is        tied to customer satisfaction levels. Consequently,                                          5          our Company-wide client satisfaction scores (over 9.0 out of 10 in fiscal        2003) are among the best in the industry.       - This high level of customer satisfaction provides us with a true        competitive advantage in the marketplace by:        - Monitoring and then responding to changing customer needs,        - Increasing the loyalty of our customers, which generates a larger         lifetime value earned from each client,        - Improving our margins by softening price sensitivity, and        - Decreasing our cost of sales due to the higher propensity for repeat         business.       - A PROPRIETARY PROPENSITY SCORE WEIGHTING SYSTEM. This system ensures very        accurate online data collection results by correcting for data anomalies        that occur due to sample bias - such as the difference in behavior        between online respondents and offline respondents. We believe that no        other online market research firm has an equal system to correctly weight        data and project results to a larger population. The accuracy of this        system was proven when Harris Interactive produced the most accurate        forecast of the 2000 U.S. presidential election and state-by-state        forecasts (72 races in total) that were approximately 2 times as accurate        as those generated through telephone polls.       - THE WORLD\\'S LARGEST INTERNET PANEL for conducting online market research.        Currently, our panel consists of several million individuals from around        the world who have been double opted-in and voluntarily agreed to        participate in our various online research studies. We are currently        adding thousands of additional names to our global panel on a daily        basis. This large and diverse Internet panel enables us to:        - conduct a broad range of customer-specific or multi-client research         studies across a wide set of industries,        - conduct very large surveys of the general population and studies of         low-incidence, hard-to-find subsets,        - market new research products and services through co-branded alliances         that we historically could not develop alone, and        - sell our online data collection services to other research firms through         the Harris Interactive Service Bureau, enabling us to penetrate new         markets and gain additional market share where we do not have         relationships or specific expertise.       - SPECIALTY-PANELS. During the past three years, we have performed        additional screening of the respondents in our main panel in order to        form specialty panels or groups of people with similar, hard to find        characteristics. We have developed numerous specialty panels, including        Affluent, Chronic Illness, Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual, Mothers and        Expectant Mothers, Physicians, Pet Companion and Technology Decision        Makers. Our clients highly value our ability to rapidly perform online        surveying of these low incidence populations, and have even asked us to        develop proprietary specialty panels exclusively for their use. Specialty        panel research has become a key driver of high profit revenue growth for        the Company.       - PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. A significant amount of computer        software and hardware is required to conduct Internet-based market        research and polling. The key elements of our technology infrastructure        include:        - A HIGH SPEED CUSTOMIZED EMAIL SYSTEM, which enables us to rapidly         format, target and send over one million customized email invitations         per hour;        - A SOPHISTICATED SURVEY ENGINE, which can process 240,000 five-minute         incoming surveys per hour with a peak capacity of 20,000 surveys         processed simultaneously;        - SOFTWARE SYSTEMS with the ability to collect data in any language         supported by Microsoft, including double-byte character sets (such as         the Asian languages) and left to right reading languages;                                          6         - An advanced SURVEY DISPATCHER SYSTEM, which acts like an air traffic         control system to monitor, control and balance all respondent activity         across all of our servers - and to ensure that no respondent will get a         \"sorry - the system is busy\" notice. In addition, our proprietary         dispatcher system gathers real-time statistics on survey starts,         suspensions and completions, shutting off the surveys when the         contracted completion levels have been achieved, thereby reducing cost         overruns.        - A patented customizable MULTI-LANGUAGE REGISTRATION AND POLLING SYSTEM,         which allows new and existing panel members to add, delete or update         their registration information online, and which recognizes each         panelist\\'s language preference and delivers the survey in that language;        - Flexible, AUTOMATED REAL TIME REPORTING TOOLS that allow online access         to weighted survey data at any time and speed the process of data         delivery to clients;       - A SCALABLE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. This infrastructure was designed        with no theoretical upper limit and can easily and cheaply grow with the        expansion of our business. Currently, we believe that we can double our        existing capacity at a cost of less than $300,000.       - A STRONG BRAND. We believe that The Harris Poll is one of the best-known        polls operating in the United States today. For over 45 years, The Harris        Poll has been recognized for providing trusted information to a broad        range of companies, non-profit organizations and governmental agencies.        We use a variety of marketing strategies to heighten awareness of and        enhance brand recognition of The Harris Poll, Harris Interactive and our        Internet-based products and services.  OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES       Our services are focused upon serving numerous vertical markets, which include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical and health care, ecommerce, consumer packaged goods, automotive, financial services, technology, education, media and advertising and public policy. By aligning all of our support functions (e.g. sales, marketing, research staff, etc.) to specific vertical markets, we can effectively and efficiently deliver our services, while providing a high level of industry expertise and consultative support.       Our three primary sources of revenue are:        - custom research        - multi-client research        - service bureau research       All multi-client and service bureau research is conducted via the Internet. We deliver custom research by employing both traditional and Internet-based methodologies. Currently, we are aggressively transitioning our custom research and polling products and services to Internet-based research. During fiscal 2003, 46% of our total revenue was derived from Internet-based products, up from 41% in fiscal 2002. We continue to dedicate a significant amount of our financial and management resources to developing and marketing new products and services that use our Internet-based methodologies.                                          7        The following table summarizes our products and services.    PRODUCT TYPE                                 DESCRIPTION                           METHODOLOGY ------------                                 -----------                           -----------    Custom Research                  Market research and polling          Traditional and Internet-based                                  conducted on an issue specifically                                  identified by a client. Multi-Client Research            Studies developed for, and sold to,  Internet-based                                  a large number of clients who have                                  a similar interest in a particular                                  subject area -- like Equitrend(R)                                  brand equity research and our                                  annual Business School Reputation                                  Rankings. Service Bureau Research          Data Collection conducted for other  Internet-based                                  market research firms.   CUSTOM RESEARCH       For almost 50 years, we have provided custom research to a broad range of clients, ranging from business-to-business and business-to-consumer companies, to non-profit organizations and governmental agencies. This experience has served as our foundation to build the techniques used to conduct accurate Internet-based custom research. Our long history has also provided us with particular strong expertise in the following markets:       - health care,       - pharmaceuticals and medical devices,       - office equipment and technology,       - education and public policy,       - transportation,       - marketing communications and advertising, and       - public relations.       We conduct many types of custom research including customer satisfaction surveys, market share studies, new product introduction studies, brand recognition studies, reputation studies, ad concept testing and more. A custom research project has three distinct phases:       - SURVEY DESIGN -- Initial meetings are conducted with the client to        clearly define the objectives and reasons for the study which ensures        that the data collected by the research will meet the customer\\'s needs.        Based on the requirements, we then determine the proper research        procedure such as a mail, telephone or Internet survey, focus group        meetings or personal interviews, identify the population to be surveyed,        and design the survey questionnaire or focus group protocol.       - DATA COLLECTION -- Field data collection is conducted through        computer-aided Internet or telephone interviewing, by mail or in person,        or by holding focus group meetings or any combination of the above.        Quality procedures assure that surveys are returned and the correct        number of interviews are completed.       - WEIGHTING, ANALYSIS AND REPORTING -- We review the collected data for        sufficiency and completeness, weight the data accordingly, and then        analyze by desired demographic, business or industry characteristics. A        comprehensive report that typically includes recommendations is then        prepared and delivered to the client.       Our proprietary sample design and questionnaire development techniques ensure that complete and accurate information is collected, and that this data will satisfy the specific inquiries of our clients. We have developed in-depth data collection techniques that enhance the integrity and reliability of our sample database. Our survey methodology ensures that responses are derived from the appropriate decision-makers in each category. As a result, we deliver the data that our clients need.                                          8   MULTI-CLIENT RESEARCH       Multi-client research is sold on a one-time or subscription basis to a large number of customers that have an interest in a particular market segment or research application. Our multi-client products are developed on an independent or co-branded basis and are marketed by us. We collaborate with other parties that have unique experience in a particular subject or market to produce co-branded multi-client products. Agreements for co-branded studies are negotiated on a case-by-case basis, with revenue generally applied to specified categories of expenses and any profits shared accordingly. Co- branded products typically enable our clients to conduct research that they could not conduct without our Internet panel and technology infrastructure. By combining their expertise with our vast database and research capabilities, we are able to develop and market products that benefit both parties.  SERVICE BUREAU RESEARCH       The Harris Interactive Service Bureau (HISB) conducts Internet-based data collection for other market research firms that either do not have the necessary resources to develop Internet-based market research capabilities or that have otherwise chosen not to develop such capabilities themselves. In addition to being a strong revenue source, HISB also enables us to penetrate markets or industries where we do not have current relationships or specific expertise. We also believe that HISB reduces the likelihood that those clients will invest significant financial and management resources to develop competitive Internet-based market research capabilities, and therefore serves as a barrier to entry to our competition       Harris Interactive Service Bureau clients can utilize our data collection capabilities on a long-term, continuous basis or on a project-by-project basis. During fiscal 2003, 100 market research firms used HISB, up from 90 in fiscal 2002 and 74 at the end of fiscal 2001.  OUR CLIENTS       In fiscal 2003, approximately 42% of the Company\\'s revenue was derived from Fortune 500 companies. The Company served approximately 1,070 clients, derived from the following lines of business:                                                                   % FY2003                                                                REVENUE                                                                --------   Customer Loyalty Management.................................      25 Health Care.................................................      19 Technology..................................................      11 Harris Interactive Service Bureau (HISB)....................       7 Strategic Brands & Consulting...............................       7 Media & Public Relations....................................       6 Automotive & Transportation.................................       5 Marketing Communications....................................       4 Youth & Education...........................................       3 Customer Retention..........................................       3 General Markets/Other.......................................      10        In fiscal 2003, no single client accounted for more than 10% of the Company\\'s consolidated revenue.  OUR SALES AND MARKETING PROGRAMS       During fiscal 2003 the Company invested approximately $2.3 million to implement a broad range of sales and marketing programs, intended to:       - raise awareness of the The Harris Poll, The Harris Poll Online, Harris        Interactive, HI Europe and Harris Interactive Japan brands,       - build specific product awareness,                                          9        - generate new sales leads,       - expand our Internet panel, and       - support our global network.       Marketing activities are integrated and may contain elements of public relations, offline and online advertising and promotion, trade shows, industry event participation and speaking engagements, market research knowledge sharing conferences and direct marketing.       - PUBLIC RELATIONS. We engage in comprehensive media relations and public        relations on a full time basis. We regularly create and distribute, via        national and international news wires, media releases for both our        Company and our clients who desire to jointly release data from studies        that we have conducted. During fiscal 2003, the Company created and        distributed over 150 media releases, including the worldwide weekly        distribution of The Harris Poll and The Harris Interactive Health Care        News. Our public relations team also collaborated with our clients on        over 250 joint releases of information, and responded to over 2,500 media        inquiries from reporters, editors, authors and educational institutions        who wanted to publish our data. The Harris Interactive name regularly        appears in Business Week and Time magazines, and on CNN as a research        provider for Time/CNN surveys. BRANDWEEK and The Wall Street Journal        publish our brand and reputation research on a regular basis. Public        Relations has been, and will remain, the main driver behind the rapid        increase in the overall awareness of the Harris Interactive brand.       - TRADE SHOWS AND SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS. To further our position as a global        leader in Internet-based research, Harris Interactive has participated        and will continue to participate in a large number of industry        tradeshows, seminars and expositions. Speakers from the Company have        traveled the world to share their knowledge with many prestigious        organizations, including the Congress of the United States.       - OFFLINE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION. We use print advertising in U.S.,        European and Japanese business and trade publications to raise awareness        of our brand name and to generate leads for individual products and        services. The weekly, public release of The Harris Poll is one of our        most effective offline promotional activities. The Company also publishes        The Harris Interactive Health Care News, containing recent health care        research on a weekly schedule. We also regularly publish Trends and        \\'Tudes (youth and education research), Entree (food and beverage industry        research) and @dvantage (HISB) newsletters to share knowledge with our        current and potential customers.       - ONLINE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION. The Company has entered into numerous        agreements with Internet portals, like The Wall Street Journal Online,        which publishes the weekly editions of The Harris Poll and The Wall        Street Journal-Harris Interactive Health Care Poll. The Company also        purchases key word searches, global banner advertising and        co-registration opportunities to generate leads and to recruit new        members into The Harris Poll Online. Currently, these efforts are adding        thousands of double-opted in panel members per day in the U.S., Canada,        The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Scandinavian        countries. Other online promotions are undertaken from time to time to        recruit special population segments into our panel such as senior        citizens, teens, minorities, practicing physicians and information        technology (IT) users.       - DIRECT MARKETING. Direct marketing strategies are also used to generate        leads for our specific products and services. Campaigns that incorporate        dimensional mail in combination with outbound telemarketing calls        conducted by the inside sales force, have yielded the greatest response.        These campaigns are scheduled on a rotating basis throughout the year to        support all major lines of business and to maximize the productivity of        the inside sales force.       - SALES FORCE AUTOMATION. At the end of fiscal 2003, a major effort to        implement a web-based, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system was        launched for internal use. We expect that by the end of December 2003,        more than 200 employees in the U.S. and Europe will be wired into this        integrated system to share customer data, manage leads and contacts as        well as track sales proposals, RFP\\'s and contracts sold.                                          10   OUR COMPETITION       We compete with numerous market research firms, as well as corporations and individuals that perform market research studies on an isolated basis, many of whom have market shares larger than our own. Consolidation in the industry continues to create larger and larger global firms, some with billions of dollars in annual revenue.       Industry analysts at Inside Research estimate that traditional market research and polling revenue in the U.S. will grow at about 1.9% (compounded annual growth rate, \"CAGR\", adjusted for inflation) in calendar year 2003, while the Internet-based market research and polling segment of the industry will grow at about 17% (CAGR adjusted for inflation) in calendar year 2003 -- down from 60% (CAGR adjusted for inflation) in CY2002 and 53% (CAGR adjusted for inflation) in CY2001. Although barriers to entry are high, we expect that competition will intensify as existing market research firms continue to invest in building their online research capabilities.       We will likely also face competition in the future from other traditional market research firms who move into Internet-based technologies or other companies with access to large databases of individuals with whom they can communicate on the Internet. These companies may, either alone or in alliances with other firms, attempt to penetrate this market.       Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories or significantly greater financial and marketing resources. These competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their services, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential employees, partners and potential customers.       Further, our competitors and potential competitors may develop technologies that are superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than our own.       We believe, however, that we can and will remain highly competitive due to the knowledge of our people and our ability to excel in:       - proprietary sample design techniques,       - questionnaire development,       - in-depth data collection, and       - the ability to accurately deliver data that represents the desired        demographics.       We also believe that we have additional competitive advantages such as:       - our expanding global footprint       - our ability to project results to the required universe,       - our large Internet panel, diverse in geographic scope and demographic        depth,       - our scalable proprietary Internet technology platform,       - our quality, and the depth and breadth of our products and services,       - our brand recognition and strong reputation,       - our values, and       - our very high levels of customer satisfaction  OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS       Our success in becoming the leader in Internet-based market research has been largely driven not only by our investment in our database but also by our proprietary software technology, research methodology, data weighting and analysis techniques, and the internal processes that we developed to conduct online research. This intellectual property is essential to our continued success, and to protect it, we rely on a combination of patent,                                          11   copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, plus confidentiality and license agreements. In October 2001, we received a patent for a system to conduct surveys over a network, including the Internet, to multiple respondents in multiple countries in different languages. This system only allows the respondent to participate once. It can also dynamically generate surveys from a database as well as immediately show and compare the results of the surveys. The patent will expire February 2, 2019. We also have two additional patents pending:       - For ConceptLoc(TM) -- a proprietary suite of online security products        that protect non-animated graphics interchange format and Joint        Photographic Expert Group images, prevent printing of protected images,        disable screen print capability, disable save, save as, drag and drop,        and copy capabilities and defeat third-party capture applications; and       - Harris Interactive Configurator -- a system to conduct \"build your own\"        product configuration research over a network.       Our success and ability to compete substantially depend on our internally developed technologies and trademarks. We have trademark registrations for a number of our trademarks, including Harris Interactive, HI Europe, and The Harris Poll. If we were prevented from using The Harris Poll name, our brand recognition and business would likely suffer. We would have to make substantial financial investments to rebuild our brand identity.       Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available.       Under the terms of our 1996 acquisition of Louis Harris and Associates, we purchased the HARRIS name including The Harris Poll, for global use except for use in Europe and the European portion of the former Soviet Union (the \"Territory\"). The prior owner of Louis Harris and Associates sold the HARRIS name for use in the Territory, and those rights are now owned by Taylor Nelson Sofres plc. (\"TNS\"). In February 2000, we entered into a trademark license agreement with TNS, which provides us with a non-transferable license to use the names HARRIS ONLINE, HARRIS POLL ONLINE, HARRIS INTERACTIVE, and HARRIS POLL INTERACTIVE within the Territory.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW       Harris Interactive provides market research, polling and consulting services to a broad range of companies, non-profit organizations and governmental agencies. Since 1956, we have provided these services utilizing traditional market research and polling methodologies, such as direct mail, telephone-based surveys, mall intercepts, focus groups and in-person interviews. In September 1997, we began developing our Internet panel and building the technology infrastructure to provide online market research and polling services. In November 1997, we introduced our first Internet-based market research and polling services.       We generally perform traditional and Internet-based custom research services on a fixed fee basis in response to client-generated requests. We sell our multi-client research services on a periodic subscription basis, typically annually. Harris Interactive Service Bureau also performs research for other market research firms on a project-by-project basis in response to requests from those firms.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES       The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of the Company\\'s financial statements for fiscal 2003 include:       - Revenue recognition,       - Provision for uncollectible accounts,       - Valuation of intangible assets and other long-lived assets,       - Valuation of goodwill       - Realizability of deferred tax assets, and       - HIpoints(TM) loyalty program.       In each situation, management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain.       Revenue under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. This revenue includes amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct expenses. Provisions for estimated contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. Subscription revenue is recognized upon delivery of the research results. Revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of operations of the Company.       The Company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts and estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, thereby resulting in an inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.       The Company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets and long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to: a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset; significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of the Company\\'s use of the underlying assets or their physical condition; and significant adverse industry or market trends. In the event that the carrying value of an asset is determined to be unrecoverable, the Company would record an adjustment to the respective carrying value.       With respect to goodwill, the Company completes an impairment test on an annual basis. In performing this annual test, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units with each reporting unit\\'s carrying amount, including goodwill. In the event that a reporting unit\\'s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the Company would record an adjustment to the respective reporting unit\\'s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. In addition to the annual impairment analysis, the Company also                                          19   assesses the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable.       The Company evaluates the valuation allowance and potential realization of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In the determination of the valuation allowance, the Company has considered future taxable income. As a result of the Company\\'s operating performance in fiscal 2003 and the more favorable near term outlook for profitability, a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed with the resultant benefit to income and goodwill. Should the Company determine that it is more likely than not that it will realize additional deferred tax assets in the future, an additional adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance, with the resultant benefit to income, goodwill and additional paid in capital. Further financial information about income taxes is included in Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" to our Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.       Since July 2001, the Company has had a loyalty program (HIpoints(TM)), whereby points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for the Company\\'s online panel, complete online surveys and refer others to join the online panel. The earned points, which are non-transferable, may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio. The Company maintains a reserve for its obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points, calculated based on the expected redemption rate of the points. This expected redemption rate is estimated based on research from other loyalty and retention programs and the Company\\'s actual redemption rates to date. An actual redemption rate that differs from this estimated redemption rate may have a material impact on the results of operations of the Company.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS       On November 1, 2001 the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Total Research Corporation (\"Total Research\"), a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 5, 2001, among the Company, Total Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Total Research. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Total Merger Sub was merged with and into Total Research (the \"Merger\"), with Total Research continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Harris Interactive and Total Research are engaged in complementary businesses in the market research and polling industry. The acquisition has created revenue growth, cost savings and other synergies including the ability to convert Total Research traditional-based clients to the Internet, sell to one another\\'s customers, offer customers more comprehensive and diverse services, and use a combined worldwide network. For example, the Company was able to build on Total Research\\'s prior relationship with a key customer to win unrelated Internet-based work in excess of $1 million over the past year.       Upon consummation of the Merger, each outstanding share of Total Research common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.222 shares of Harris Interactive common stock, par value $.001 per share. An aggregate of approximately 16,610,000 shares of common stock, with an estimated fair value of $41.3 million, was issued to the stockholders of Total Research Corporation. The value was determined using the average fair market value of the stock for the range of trading days beginning August 2, 2001 and ending August 8, 2001. Additionally, pursuant to the merger agreement, all outstanding options to purchase shares of Total Research common stock were, upon consummation of the Merger, fully vested and converted into an option to purchase 1.222 shares of Harris Interactive common stock. As a result, the former option holders of Total Research received from Harris Interactive options to purchase approximately 2,899,000 shares of Harris Interactive common stock, with an estimated fair value of $3.6 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with FAS 141 and is included in the Company\\'s financial statements commencing on November 1, 2001. The Company has recorded approximately $50.5 million in goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 141.       In September, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of M&A Create Limited, a privately owned company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of Harris Interactive common stock. Additionally, in August, 2001, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Market Research Solutions Limited, a privately owned UK company, headquartered in                                          20   Oxford, England, in consideration of a combination of cash and shares of Harris Interactive common stock, and in February, 2001 the Company acquired all of the assets of the custom research group of Yankelovich Partners, Inc., headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut.  RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE       During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring and asset write-down charge of $6.2 million directly related to the operational integration of Harris Interactive and Total Research. Management developed a formal plan that included a 5% reduction in Harris Interactive staff of the full-time workforce in Rochester, NY; New York, NY; Norwalk, CT and a few other outlying locations. The affected employees were mainly support staff with overlapping functions in the combined Company. Other integration actions included the closing of our telephone center located in Youngstown, OH and offices in New York, NY and Chicago, IL, which resulted in asset write- downs and a reserve for lease commitments at these locations. The plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the second fiscal quarter of 2002. The Company realized approximately $1.1 million in non-cash savings and $1.9 million in cash savings in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003 the Company realized non-cash savings of approximately $2.1 million and cash savings of approximately $5.6 million.       The following table summarizes activity with respect to the restructuring and asset impairment charge for the period ended June 30, 2003:                                                                        (IN THOUSANDS)                                                     ----------------------------------------------                                                                    ASSET         LEASE                                                     SEVERANCE   WRITE-DOWNS   COMMITMENTS   TOTAL                                                     ---------   -----------   -----------   ------      Net charge fiscal 2002............................   $1,169       $2,792        $2,261      $6,222   Asset write-offs during fiscal 2002.............        0       (2,792)            0      (2,792)   Cash payments during fiscal 2002................

During fiscal 2003, the Company adjusted the reserve for restructuring charges by $997,000 for lease commitments that were no longer required. The adjustments were due to the Company obtaining a release from its obligations under lease obligations previously included in restructuring charges.       The total number of employees included in the charge and ultimately terminated was 82.                                          21   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       The following table sets forth for the periods indicated our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue:                                                                  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,                                                               --------------------                                                               2003    2002    2001                                                               ----    ----    ----     Revenue from services.......................................  100%    100%    100% Cost of services............................................   51      53      51                                                               ---     ---     --- Gross profit................................................   49      47      49                                                               ---     ---     --- Operating expenses: Sales and marketing.........................................    7      10      14 General and administrative..................................   37      47      81 Restructuring (credits) charges and asset write-downs.......

Total fiscal 2003 revenue increased 30%, from $100.0 million in fiscal 2002 to $130.6 million in fiscal 2003. This increase in revenue was primarily driven by the $22.6 million increase in U.S. revenue, or 29%, to $101.1 million for fiscal 2003. The increased U.S. revenue was partially attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of Total Research as well as overall growth in several U.S. markets, most prominently healthcare and customer loyalty management. Additionally, excluding the Total Research acquisition, the Company recognized a modest increase in U.S. revenue related to our expanding Internet client base and Internet-based market research services, which contributed $59.3 million in total U.S. Internet-based revenue for fiscal 2003, as compared to $40.6 million for the prior fiscal year.       Revenue for the United Kingdom increased from the prior year by $6.6 million, or 40%, to $23.0 million in fiscal 2003. Revenue for Japan increased $1.3 million, or 26%, to $6.5 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in U.K. revenue was primarily attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of Total Research in November 2001. Revenue from Japan increased due to the continued benefit we derived from new contracts with selected customers throughout fiscal 2003.       GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit was $63.7 million, or 49% of revenue, for fiscal 2003, compared with $46.6 million, or 47% of revenue, for fiscal 2002. The improvement in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the growth in Internet-related business relative to overall revenue growth. Revenue from Internet-based services was $60.1 million, or 46% of total revenue, in fiscal 2003, compared with $40.6 million, or 41% of revenue, for fiscal 2002. This increase in Internet revenue was due in part to the acquisition of new Internet-based projects as well as the conversion of existing, traditional work to the Internet. Additionally, through increasing the level of Internet related work, the Company has been able to use our existing panel for research in place of more expensive outsourcing and telephone costs. HISB has also played a significant role in the growth of Internet revenue. HISB projects generate higher gross margins due to the fact that they are data collection only and typically do not include as much professional time as customer Internet-based research work.       SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2003 were $9.5 million, or 7% of revenue, compared with $9.7 million, or 10% of revenue, for fiscal 2002. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased three percentage points. The decrease is attributable to reductions in headcount and related expenses, reflecting the Company\\'s continuing efforts to reduce costs, as well as productivity improvements from                                          22   the increased experience level of the Company\\'s sales force with Harris Interactive sales and marketing strategies. The Company has been able to maintain a consistent level of sales and marketing costs as a percentage of sales throughout the fiscal year despite increased fiscal 2003 fourth quarter expenditures for incentive compensation and severance related costs. The severance related costs were associated with reorganizing our U.K. management team and the closing of one of our four U.K. offices. The additional incentive compensation expense resulted from increased full year revenue results as compared to budget that led to increased commissions and bonuses to employees in accordance with the Company\\'s compensation plans. In total annual expenditures in fiscal 2003 continue to support the Company\\'s overall business model established in the prior year.       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses were $47.5 million, or 37% of revenue, in fiscal 2003 compared with $46.7 million, or 47% of revenue, for fiscal 2002. The ten percentage point decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects reductions in headcount and related expenses, rent expense and depreciation expense, and reflects the Company\\'s continuing efforts to reduce costs. Depreciation and equipment rental and maintenance expenses decreased by a combined $1.1 million, or 15%, to $6.3 million in fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the fixed asset write-offs in connection with the Company\\'s fiscal 2002 second quarter restructuring charge which reduced the level of gross fixed assets. The 2002 restructuring plan also reduced fiscal 2003 rent expense by $0.7 million as a result of the closing of three of our telephone centers. As part of its cost savings efforts, the Company has eliminated all but two telephone centers in the United States and the United Kingdom, retaining one in each country primarily to support committed projects with longer-term, predictable needs. The balance of telephone data collection has been migrated to lower cost providers, including some in foreign countries. The cost savings from the prior year restructuring plan were partially offset by increased database development costs related to the establishment of our Western European panel as well as the continued expansion of our U.S. panel, which are expected to continue in fiscal 2004.       INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.  Net interest and other income totaled $0.5 million for fiscal 2003 compared with $1.3 million for fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower average marketable securities balance and interest rates for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.       INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.0 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to a minimal expense in fiscal 2002. For financial reporting purposes, in fiscal 2003 the Company was able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to apply against current year net income, resulting in substantially no current income tax expense. The recorded benefit in 2003 was as a result of the partial reversal of the valuation allowance on the Company\\'s deferred tax assets. Since the deferred tax assets were substantially comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and it was determined that it is more likely than not that we will utilize additional net operating losses in the near future, as required by GAAP a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in 2003. Due to operating losses in fiscal 2002 no benefit was recognized in that fiscal year.  FISCAL 2002 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001       REVENUE FROM SERVICES.  Revenue increased 67% from $60.1 million in fiscal 2001 to $100.0 million in fiscal 2002. The revenue growth was mainly due to the acquisitions of Total Research in November of fiscal 2002, the Yankelovich custom research group in February of fiscal 2001, and Market Research Solutions Limited and M&A Create Limited in August of fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2002, the Company also increased Internet-based revenue to $40.6 million, from $32.6 million in fiscal 2001. Acquiring new Internet-based revenue as well as converting existing, traditional work to the Internet drove this 25% increase.       GROSS PROFIT.  Gross profit decreased to 47% in fiscal 2002, from 49% in fiscal 2001. The margins declined primarily because a large majority of the revenue derived from acquisitions was generated from traditional research as opposed to Internet-based research.       SALES AND MARKETING.  Sales and marketing expenses were $9.7 million for fiscal 2002, or 10% of revenue, compared with $8.5 million, or 14% of revenue for fiscal 2001. The absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and related expenses resulting from the acquisition of Total Research and an increase in sales commission expense. The improvement as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the Company\\'s continuing efforts to reduce overall costs.                                          23        GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  General and administrative expenses were $46.7 million, or 47% of revenue in fiscal 2002, compared with $48.5 million, or 81% of revenue in fiscal 2001. Similar to sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses excluding database development costs have increased in absolute dollars due to increased personnel and related costs, including rent and depreciation expense, resulting from the acquisition of Total Research. The decrease as a percentage of revenue was directly attributable to continuing cost reduction efforts including the fiscal 2002, second quarter restructuring plan. Internet database development costs declined $7.0 million, or 95%, to $0.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $7.4 million in fiscal 2001. This decrease was primarily due to significant expenditures to build our U.S. database in fiscal 2001, the decreased price to acquire double opt-in names for database replenishment in fiscal 2002, the termination of our panel recruitment agreement with during fiscal 2002, and the elimination of costs associated with The Planet Project Global Poll conducted in November 2000.       INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.  Net interest and other income totaled $1.3 million for fiscal 2002, compared with $3.7 million for fiscal 2001. The decrease is primarily attributable to a lower average marketable securities balance for fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING COMPANY PERFORMANCE       In the past, the Company has reported EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined under SEC Regulation G. The Company has reported EBITDA because management believes that EBITDA, although not a GAAP measurement, is widely understood and is an additional tool that assists investors in evaluating current operating performance of the business without the effect of the non-cash depreciation and amortization expenses. Management internally monitors EBITDA to monitor cash flow unencumbered by non-cash items. While instructive, EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, operating income, net income or cash flows from operations or any other GAAP measure of performance or liquidity.       Globally, for fiscal 2003, EBITDA was $13.3 million, or 10% of revenue, compared to the fiscal 2002 and 2001 EBITDA losses of $9.6 million and $21.3 million, or 10% and 35% of revenue, respectively, as reconciled with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP within the following table.

The primary factors driving the growth in the Company\\'s gross profit, EBITDA and net income (loss) are growth in revenue and the mix of the revenue derived from Internet versus traditional work. The Company\\'s model is based upon the premise that Internet work is more profitable than traditional work, due to the                                          24   comparatively low variable data collection cost of Internet work. The model, which the Company believes reasonably represents comparability of traditional and Internet-based projects, is as follows:                                                                  TRADITIONAL   INTERNET-BASED                                                               -----------   --------------    Revenue.....................................................      100%        100% Less: Cost of Services (as a % of revenue)   Direct Payroll............................................       25%        30%   Variable Data Collection..................................       40%        5% - 10%                                                                   ---         --------- Variable Gross Profit (as a % of revenue)...................       35%        60% - 65%                                                                   ===         =========        In addition to the Variable Data Collection Costs, the Internet-Based model has additional fixed costs associated with the development and maintenance of underlying databases and Internet technology. Such costs decrease Net Income and EBITDA for Internet-based work. In general, however, due to the interplay between the variable and fixed components of cost, the premise is that, as the percentage of Internet work increases, and assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses continue to be managed in the ordinary course, Net Income and EBITDA as a percentage of revenue should also increase. Based upon the operation of the model, the Company believes that net operating margins of its business can grow steadily over a period of years with a potential as high as EBITDA in the range of high teens to 20%. Such growth is predicated upon the Company\\'s global mix of Internet-based versus traditional work, continued growth of revenue with the ability to continue to achieve reasonable pricing, controlled growth of operating expenses, and maintenance and continued growth of the respondent database sufficient to support the Company\\'s business at reasonable per-unit costs. The model should be viewed as illustrative and not as an actual measure or predictor of any particular project or the Company\\'s projects as a whole at any given point in time.       Regarding the Company\\'s ability to continue to generate revenue, the Company must constantly develop new business, both for growth and to replace non-renewed projects. Although work for no one client constitutes more than 10% of the Company\\'s revenue, the Company has had to, and in the future will likely have to, find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as customer relationships and work for continuing customers change. The Company\\'s ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of its business plan but also on general market factors outside of its control. Many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary. As a result, as economic conditions decline in any of our markets, our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted.       The Company believes that its ability to continue to sustain and grow revenue is significantly affected by client satisfaction with completed work, and that improved client satisfaction ratings have had and will continue to have a positive impact on the growth of the Company\\'s business. We have instituted what we believe are among the most comprehensive systems to measure client satisfaction in our industry. We use information provided by our clients to improve the quality of our products, services, and relationships, and therefore to improve future satisfaction levels. As the Company matured in the conversion of its business model to the Internet, we have been able to improve client satisfaction scores to over 9.0 out of 10.0, among the top in our industry. We believe that such improvements have had a direct result in greater customer loyalty and an increased rate of customer acceptance of our proposals.       Regarding the mix of work, for fiscal 2003, the Company\\'s actual Internet mix was 46% on a global basis and 59% in the United States alone. The Company considers all of the revenue from a project to be Internet-based whenever 50% or more of the surveys were completed over the Internet. Although the Company continues to work to convert projects to the Internet in the United States, the primary new growth opportunity is in Europe, where the ability to change the Internet mix is dependent upon the Company\\'s success in expanding the size of its respondent panel and increase customer acceptance of Internet-based work. The globalization of the Internet portion of the Company\\'s business has commenced and we believe that it is expected to ramp up over the next several years.       The Company\\'s global database of more than 4 million Internet survey respondents continues to be a critical component of its success. The Company believes that its multi-million participant U.S. database, to which it is                                          25   adding between 3,500 and 4,000 names per day on average, continues to be adequate to service its Internet-based business. In fiscal 2003, the Company launched an initiative to build a European database as well. To that end, it has entered into name acquisition agreements with a major Internet portal and others. Names are being added regularly to the European database, which included approximately 350,000 names as of July 2003, and the Company is now conducting Internet-based projects in Europe. The Company intends to continue to expand the European panel in fiscal 2004 and beyond in order to support growth of Internet-based research in Europe and is currently adding more than 1,000 names per day. Additionally, in both the U.S. and in Europe, the Company intends to continue efforts to enhance existing and build new specialty panels. For example, it has entered into joint development activities with IMS Health, Inc. to build physician specialty panels. The amount of the Company\\'s investments in names for its databases will continue to vary, particularly quarter by quarter, based upon factors such as panel availability, opportunities that arise for acquisition or development of panels in specialty or under-represented groups, and attrition.       Internet databases by their nature experience participant attrition. There are no standard measurement systems for such attrition, particularly in the Internet survey response field. Measurement involves complex variables. For example, determining attrition, by lack of response from a panelist for a set length of time since last contact, is not necessarily reflective of expected long-term attrition. The panelist may not have had an interest in responding regarding particular survey topics offered over a period of time but may, after an absence, respond to a later survey covering a topic of particular interest to the respondent. Thus, percentage rates of attrition may not be comparable or meaningful within the industry. When the Company first developed its Internet model, it expected attrition of panel members to be in the range of 20% annually. With the Company\\'s increased expertise gained from several years of investment in panel management techniques, it monitors panel fatigue and attrition in multiple ways. Its overall attrition rates by most measures, however, are significantly less than originally anticipated.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Prior to fiscal 2003 we financed our operations primarily through the $85.5 million of net proceeds generated from our December 1999 initial public offering. Consequently, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $42.5 million at June 30, 2001, and $27.9 million at June 30, 2002. In fiscal 2003 the Company generated positive cash flows for the first time in recent years and as a result our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $39.1 at June 30, 2003.       Net cash provided by operating activities was $11.9 million for fiscal 2003 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $5.5 million and $15.5 million for fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. The positive cash flow in fiscal 2003 was primarily as a result of the Company generating net income in fiscal 2003 as compared to the funding of net losses in fiscal 2002 and 2001.       Net cash used in investing activities was $3.9 million in fiscal 2003 as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $8.0 million and $2.1 million for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001, respectively. During fiscal 2003 the Company\\'s investing activities included the net purchase of additional marketable securities of approximately $1.9 million as well as capital expenditures of $2.2 million. During fiscal 2002, net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $14.6 million were partially offset by capital expenditures of $2.8 million and the $3.8 million cash outflow for transaction related costs to acquire Total Research in November 2001. During fiscal 2001, net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $17.9 million were partially offset by capital expenditures of $7.6 million and the $8.2 million cash outflow to purchase the custom research division of Yankelovich Partners, Inc. in February 2001. Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 capital expenditures primarily supported the development of our Internet infrastructure in the U.S.       In fiscal 2003 the Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $1.8 million. The Company received cash of $4.1 million in fiscal 2003 as a result of issuances of common stock and stock option exercises; this was offset by the repayment of $2.3 million in short and long term borrowings. Net cash used in financing activities of $1.7 million in fiscal 2002 was primarily related to the repayment of long-term debt of $2.3 million and the repurchase of 422,900 shares of common stock for $0.9 million, these cash outflows were partially offset by $1.7 million provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises. Net cash provided by                                          26   financing activities was $0.1 million in fiscal 2001, resulting from issuances of common stock and stock options of $0.9 million, offset by the repurchase of common stock of $0.8 million.       Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors, including market acceptance of our services, the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our Internet infrastructure and Internet panel, marketing and selling of our services, our promotional activities, our acquisition activities and other factors. Management anticipates continuing expenditures for property, plant and equipment and working capital requirements throughout fiscal 2004 at levels consistent with fiscal 2003.       As of June 30, 2003 the Company had no short-term or long-term borrowings. At June 30, 2002, the Company had short-term and long-term borrowings of $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, limited to operations in the United Kingdom and Japan. Interest rates related to the borrowings ranged from 1.8% to 3.0%. There were no restrictive covenants associated with these borrowings.       In fiscal 2003 and 2002, the Company had, and continues to maintain, a line of credit with a commercial bank providing borrowing availability up to $5.0 million, at the prime interest rate. The prime rate in effect at June 30, 2003 was 4.0%. Borrowings under this arrangement are due upon demand. There were no borrowings under this agreement at June 30, 2003 and June 30, 2002. The line of credit is collateralized by the assets of the Company.       Based on current plans and business conditions, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements to support the Company\\'s planned operations for the foreseeable future. We cannot be certain, however, that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate. If our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations, or if accounts receivable or other assets were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated, we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements. In such event, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms, which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.  CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS (IN THOUSANDS)       The Company\\'s consolidated contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of June 30, 2003 are as follows:                                                                  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD                                                   -----------------------------------------------                                                             LESS THAN    1-3      3-5      AFTER                                                    TOTAL     1 YEAR     YEARS    YEARS    5 YEARS                                                   -------   ---------   ------   ------   -------       CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS -------------------------- Long-term debt..................................  $    --    $   --     $   --   $   --   $   -- Capital lease obligations.......................       --        --         --       --       -- Operating leases................................   18,031     4,857      6,901    3,581    2,692 Purchase obligations............................    2,767     1,237      1,530       --       -- Other long-term obligations.....................       --        --         --       --       --                                                   -------    ------     ------   ------   ------ Total contractual cash obligations..............  $20,798    $6,094     $8,431   $3,581   $2,692                                                   =======    ======     ======   ======   ======                                                         AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD                                                    ----------------------------------------------                                                             LESS THAN    1-3      3-5      AFTER                                                    TOTAL     1 YEAR     YEARS    YEARS    5 YEARS                                                    ------   ---------   ------   ------   -------       Lines of credit (1)..............................  $5,000    $   --     $   --   $   --   $   -- Standby letters of credit........................      --        --         --       --       --                                                    ------    ------     ------   ------   ------ Total commercial commitments.....................  $5,000        --         --       --   $   --                                                    ======    ======     ======   ======   ======   ---------------  (1) The Company\\'s line of credit is payable upon demand under the terms of its     agreement.

SFAS No. 145 eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. However, an entity is not prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items, so long as they meet the criteria outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, \"Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal Occurring Events and Transactions. SFAS No. 145 also eliminates the inconsistency between the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 on July 1, 2002. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 146       In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146, \"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities\". SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\") Issue No. 94-3, \"Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)\". SFAS No. 146 replaces EITF Issue No. 94-3. This standard is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. This adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 148       In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure.\" SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company is required to follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 148 in its annual financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2003 and is also required to provide the disclosures in its quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ended March 31, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS 148 on January 1, 2003 and elects to continue to account for its stock based compensation plans under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" as are described in Note 14 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 149       In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 149, \"Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except for those provisions of SFAS No. 149 which relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003. The Company                                          28   does not expect the adoption of SFAS 149 to have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 150       In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, \"Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.\" SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or as an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and is otherwise effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    FIN 45       In November 2002, the FASB published Interpretation No. 45, \"Guarantor\\'s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.\" FIN 45 requires that a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee and also discusses additional disclosures to be made in the interim and annual financial statements of the guarantor regarding obligations under certain guarantees. The initial measurement and recognition requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    FIN 46       In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, \"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.\" This standard clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, \"Consolidated Financial Statements,\" and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (more commonly known as Special Purpose Entities or SPE\\'s). FIN No. 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved. FIN No. 46 also enhances the disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities. This statement is effective for variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after January 31, 2003. The Company adopted FIN 46 on July 1, 2003. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.  RISK FACTORS  THE MARKET RESEARCH INDUSTRY IS VULNERABLE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.       Many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary. As general economic conditions decline and our customers seek to control variable costs, projects to be performed by the Company may be delayed or cancelled, and new project bookings may slow. As a result, the growth and earnings of the Company may be adversely impacted.  OUR GROWTH WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE MARKETPLACE DOES NOT CONTINUE TO CONVERT TO INTERNET-BASED MARKET RESEARCH AND POLLING.       The ongoing success of our business will depend on our ability to continually develop and market Internet-based products and services that achieve broad market acceptance. Our clients must continue to accept the Internet as an attractive replacement for traditional market research methodologies, such as direct mail, telephone-based surveys, mall intercepts, focus groups and in-person interviews.       Since the beginning of fiscal 1998, we have spent $67.1 million and significant management resources to develop and grow our Internet-based market research and polling business. Some of our clients have expressed concern that Internet users do not yet accurately reflect their applicable population, and that any information                                          29   collected via the Internet will be inherently biased. If our current and potential clients do not continue to accept our Internet-based methodologies as reliable and unbiased, our revenues may not meet expectations or may decline, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer.  WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND UNCERTAINTIES WITHIN THE MARKET RESEARCH AND POLLING INDUSTRY.       The market research and polling industry is highly fragmented and includes competitors much larger than we are. As competitors increase their ability to offer alternative products in the market, we may come under increasing pressures in selling and pricing our products and services. No one customer accounts for more than 5% of our revenues and most of our revenues are derived on a project by project basis. We must continuously replace completed work with new projects in order to sustain and grow our revenues. The market research industry tends to be adversely affected by slow or depressed business conditions in the market as a whole. We are at risk of decreased market research budgets as our customers respond to difficult economic conditions, as well as to delays in projects both committed and uncommitted.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SIZE AND DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF OUR GLOBAL INTERNET PANEL, OR IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS TO DO SO, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL SUFFER.       Our success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain and retain an adequate number of worldwide panelists in our Internet panel and its specialty-panels. Our ability to maintain an adequate online panel or increase Internet revenues may be harmed if:       - a significant number of our current online panelists decide that they are        no longer willing to participate in our surveys,       - we lose a large number of online panelists from over-use, and then must        rely on a limited number of online panelists for ongoing research,       - we are unable to attract an adequate number of replacement panelists and        specialty panel members, or       - new regulatory requirements related to Internet \"spam\" make it        impractical for us to continue operations as currently conducted.       If the number of our active survey respondents significantly decreases, or the demographic composition of our Internet panel narrows, our ability to provide our clients with accurate and statistically projectable information would likely suffer. This risk is likely to increase as our business expands. For example, our Internet panel is surveyed for our own studies as well as for studies conducted for other market research firms by our Harris Interactive Service Bureau. Our business will be unable to grow and will suffer if we have an insufficient number of panelists to respond to our surveys, or if our panel becomes unreliable due to reduced size, or because it is not representative of the general population.       Our online panelists are not obligated to participate in our surveys and polls and there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so.       We believe that our HIpoints(SM), HIstakes(SM) and instant results programs currently provide adequate incentives to encourage participation in our surveys and to maintain the size of our Internet panel. These programs may lose their effectiveness in the future, resulting in a reduction in size of the panel.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED GLOBAL GROWTH OF OUR INTERNET PANEL, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OVERCOME OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL OPERATIONS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS ON A GLOBAL LEVEL.       Key components of our strategy are extension of our Internet-based market research and polling products and services to clients globally, expansion of our Internet panel to include global online panelists and development of strategic alliances globally. The following risks are inherent in doing business on a global level:       - inability to attract a critical mass of panel members in key countries        and regions, particularly in Europe,       - export controls relating to encryption technology,       - inability to comply with or enactment of more restrictive privacy laws,                                          30        - changes in regulatory requirements,       - currency exchange fluctuations,       - problems in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods,       - potentially adverse tax consequences,       - political instability,       - Internet access restrictions, and       - anti-American sentiment or terrorist activity against American interests        abroad.       We have little or no control over these risks. We have encountered more restrictive privacy laws in connection with our business operations in Europe, which have inhibited our ability to develop our European Internet panel. We have also experienced currency exchange fluctuations, the impact of which has not been material. As we increase our global operations in the future, we may experience some or all of these risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO KEEP PACE WITH RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE WITHIN THE MARKET RESEARCH AND POLLING INDUSTRY, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN.       The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. Our current competitors also offer Internet-based and traditional market research and polling services. We expect to face future competition from other organizations that develop Internet-related products and services. These companies may, either alone or in alliances with other firms, penetrate the Internet-based market research and polling market.       Our ongoing success will depend on our continued ability to improve the performance features and reliability of our products and services. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new products and services. We could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes.  ANY FAILURE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INTERNET-BASED TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.       Any system failure, including network, software or hardware failure, that causes an interruption in our ability to communicate with our Internet panel, collect research data, or protect visual materials included in our surveys, could result in reduced revenue, and could impair our reputation. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, earthquake, flooding, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins and similar events. One supplier of our secure off-site Web hosting facilities currently maintains approximately one-third of our servers at one facility, and while we have redundancy in our systems we depend upon the supplier and others to protect our systems and operations from the events described above.       We have experienced technical difficulties and downtime of individual components of our computer system in the past and believe that technical difficulties and downtime may occur from time to time in the future. Although technical difficulties and downtime have had minimal impact on our operations during the past fiscal year, their impact may be more severe in the future. We have no formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our systems. In addition, our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic. Any increase in demands on our servers beyond that which we currently anticipate, will require us to fund the expansion and modification of our network infrastructure. If we were unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand, unanticipated system disruptions and slower data collection would likely result.       Our Internet panel members communicate with us using various Internet service providers. These providers have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties unrelated to our systems in the future.       Major components of the Internet backbone itself could fail due to terrorist attack, war or natural disaster.                                          31        While the impact of these outages in the past has been minimal, any future system delays or failures in the Internet could adversely affect our access to our online panelists, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  SUSTAINING OUR GROWTH MAY STRAIN OUR MANAGERIAL AND SYSTEMS RESOURCES.       We have grown rapidly and need to continue to grow in all areas of our operations. Managing and sustaining our growth will place significant demands on management as well as on our administrative, operational, technical and financial systems and controls. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan at projected levels.  WE MUST CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES.       Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing, sales and client support personnel. Competition for these personnel exists, and we may be unable to attract, integrate or retain the proper numbers of sufficiently qualified personnel that our business plan assumes. We have experienced in the past, and we may experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. In the past, competition for highly skilled employees has resulted in additional costs for recruitment, compensation and relocation or the provision of remote access to our facilities. To the extent that we are unable to hire and retain skilled employees in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer.  THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN LOSS OF REVENUES.       Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key technical and senior management personnel. The loss of the services of any of these persons could seriously harm our business. Although some of our key employees have signed non-competitive agreements, only a few of our employees are currently bound by an employment agreement. All of our other relationships with our officers and key employees are at will. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than Gordon S. Black.  OUR SUCCESSION PLANS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED.       We have started our search to identify potential candidates for Chief Executive Officer. The hiring of a new CEO would allow Gordon S. Black, the current CEO, to move to a position as Executive Chairman and more fully concentrate on corporate strategy, major account marketing, international expansion. investor relations, and acquisition. If the succession plans for the CEO and other senior executives are not successfully executed, and appropriate replacement(s) cannot be hired, the senior management may be overtaxed and unable to properly execute all of their duties.  OUR BUSINESS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET. THE INTERNET MAY NOT GROW, OR MAY BE UNABLE TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS PLACED ON IT BY THIS GROWTH.       If worldwide Internet usage does not continue to grow, we may be unable to attract International online panelists to our Internet panel or clients for our Internet-based market research and polling products and services. If Internet usage does continue to grow, the Internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline. Varying factors could inhibit future growth or the ability of the Internet infrastructure to adequately support the growth in Internet usage, including:       - inadequate network infrastructure,       - security concerns,       - inconsistent quality of service, and       - unavailability of cost effective, high speed service.                                          32        Our Internet panel depends on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to the Internet and our websites. Many websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the Internet network infrastructure.       If worldwide Internet usage declines, or grows at a significantly slower rate than projected, our ability to maintain our current Internet panel, expand our global Internet panel and gather research data and information around the world will decrease, which would likely harm our business financial condition and results of operations.  A BREACH OF OUR INTERNET SECURITY MEASURES OR SECURITY CONCERNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.       Internet security concerns could cause some online panelists to reduce their participation levels, provide inaccurate responses or end their membership in our Internet panel. This could harm our credibility with our current clients. If our clients become dissatisfied, they may stop using our products and services. In addition, dissatisfied and lost clients could damage our reputation. A loss of online panelists or a loss of clients would hurt our efforts to generate increased revenues.       A failure in our security measures could result in the misappropriation of private data. As a result, we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  FAILURE OR INABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.       Our success and ability to compete depends substantially on our internally developed technologies and trademarks, which we protect through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws. We have registered a number of our trademarks, including Harris Interactive and The Harris Poll. If we were prevented from using The Harris Poll name, our brand recognition and business would likely suffer. We would have to make substantial financial expenditures to promote and rebuild our brand identity.       Currently, we have pending trademark applications for a number of our products and services. We also have patent applications currently pending for our CONCEPTLOC encryption system and our system and method for conducting product configuration research over a computer-based network. In addition, we may apply for additional trademarks or patents in the future. Our patent or trademark applications may not be approved, or if approved, our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated. We cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future, whether resulting from our internally developed intellectual property or licenses or content from third parties. Any future assertions or prosecutions could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to pay money damages, introduce new trademarks, develop non-infringing technology, or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Any of those events could substantially increase our operating expenses and potentially reduce our expected revenues.       We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with parties with whom we do business, and generally control access to, and distribution of, our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure, parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our technologies. The steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies, particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.       We also rely on off-the-shelf technologies that we license from third parties. \"Off-the-shelf\" technology refers to generally commercially available software that is not customized for a particular user. These third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The inability to use licensed technology important to our business could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost. In the future, we may seek to license additional technology to enhance our current technology infrastructure. We cannot be certain that any such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in providing our products and services until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated.                                          33   WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY FOR PUBLISHING OR DISTRIBUTING CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET.       We may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our websites. We also could be subject to liability for content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites. We may be accused of sending bulk unsolicited email, and have our email blocked by many ISPs and therefore be unable to conduct online data collection.       Although we carry general liability insurance, our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type, such as defamation or trademark infringement, or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. In addition, any claims of this type, with or without merit, would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel.  LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR INTERNET PANEL COULD BE COSTLY.       We could be subject to liability claims by our online panelists for any misuse of personal information. These claims could result in costly litigation. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and other domestic and international agencies have been investigating various Internet companies regarding their use of personal information. We could incur additional costs and expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated.  CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION OR INDUSTRY PRACTICES COULD LIMIT OUR INTERNET ACTIVITIES OR RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS ON THE INTERNET.       Any new laws pertaining to the imposition of taxes on Internet access and electronic commerce could adversely affect our business. In February 1999, the Federal Communications Commission issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to allow local exchange carriers to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic delivered to information service providers, particularly Internet service providers, on the basis that traffic bound for Internet service providers is largely interstate. As a result of this ruling, the costs of transmitting data over the Internet may increase and our business could suffer.       As of July 2003, at least 37 U.S. state legislatures had enacted laws regulating the distribution of unsolicited email.       In April 2003, The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN-SPAM) was introduced in the U.S. senate. This bill would require unsolicited e-mail marketing messages have a valid return address. E-mail marketers would be required to remove customers from their mailing lists if requested. The bill also give more legal ammunition for ISPs to take spammers to court, allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to impose fines, and gives state attorneys general the power to bring lawsuit.       Any future legislation or regulations or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet could limit our effectiveness in conducting Internet-based market research and polling, and increase our operating expenses. In addition, the application of existing laws to the Internet could expose us to substantial liability for which we might not be indemnified by content providers or other third parties. Existing laws and regulations currently address, and new laws and regulations and industry self-regulatory initiatives are likely to address, a variety of issues, including the following:       - email distribution,       - user privacy and expression,       - the rights and safety of children,       - intellectual property,       - information security,       - anti-competitive practices,       - the convergence of traditional channels with Internet commerce,       - taxation and pricing, and                                          34        - the characteristics and quality of products and services.       Those laws that do reference the Internet have limited interpretation by the courts and their applicability and scope are not well defined, particularly on an International basis. Any new laws or regulations relating to the Internet could adversely affect our business.       Industry standards related to the Internet are still evolving. Moreover, some private entities have proposed their own standards for communications with, and use of information related to, individuals who use the Internet. Internet service providers also have the ability to disrupt our communications with our panel. Although we believe that we maintain the highest standards for the recruitment of members into our database, communications with our panelists and use of information provided by our respondents, some service providers and/or self appointed industry regulators may not agree. As a result, our communications with our panelists may be disrupted from time to time.  WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND MAY INCUR THEM AGAIN.       We incurred net losses of $14.8 million in fiscal 2002, $24.0 million in fiscal 2001 and $20.9 million in fiscal 2000. We base current and future expense levels on our operating plans, which are based on our estimates of future revenues. While we have been profitable for fiscal 2003, if our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate, or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth, we may not be able to maintain profitability. Even if we remain profitable in the future, we may be unable to maintain current profitability growth on an ongoing basis.  VARIATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY CAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.       Our quarterly operating results have in the past, and may in the future, fluctuate significantly. Our future results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this happens, the price of our common stock would likely decline.       Factors that are outside of our control, and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future, include:       - declines in general economic conditions or the budgets of our clients,       - a general decline in the demand for market research and polling products        and services,       - seasonal decreases in demand for market research and polling services,       - development of equal or superior products and services by our        competitors,       - technical difficulties that cause general and long-term failure of the        Internet, and       - currency fluctuations.       Factors that are partially within our control, and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future, include:       - our relative mix of Internet-based and traditional market research and        polling businesses,       - technical difficulties that negatively affect our operations,       - our ability to maintain the proper critical mass and scope of our        Internet panel necessary to develop and sell new products and services        and generate expected revenues,       - our ability to recruit respondents into our sub-panels, such as our IT        Decision Makers, to conduct high-value research for our clients, and       - development of new, marketable products and services       The factors listed above may affect both our quarter-to-quarter operating results as well as our long-term success. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations or any other trend in our performance as an indication of our future results.                                          35   THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS.       The market prices of the securities of Internet-related companies have been especially volatile and these securities may be overvalued. The market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations. If financial operating results do not improve or improve at a slower rate than we anticipate, or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly, or if some other event adversely affects us, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. In addition, if the market for Internet-related stocks or the stock market in general experiences an additional loss in investor confidence or declines again, the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Investors might be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation. If we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\\'s attention and resources.  ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR CHARTER COULD DELAY OR PREVENT AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY.       Our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes and provides our board of directors with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.       This preferred stock could have voting rights, including voting rights that could be superior to that of our common stock, and the board of directors has the power to determine these voting rights. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire our company. The effect of these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law provisions could discourage or prevent third parties from seeking to obtain control of us, including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices.  POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF, OR INVESTMENTS IN, OTHER COMPANIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AND/OR HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.       As part of our continued strategy to increase revenue, expand our Internet panel, acquire additional intellectual capital and add to our portfolio of existing products and services, we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses, services, products or technologies. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire them at reasonable prices and/or on reasonable terms.       Some material risks of acquisitions are:       - difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations,        technologies, products and personnel of the acquired business,       - the diversion of management\\'s attention from other business concerns,       - the availability of favorable acquisition financing, and       - the potential loss of key employees and/or customers of any acquired        business.       Acquisitions may require the use of significant amounts of cash, resulting in the inability to use those funds for other business purposes. Acquisitions using our capital stock could have a dilutive effect, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Amortization of intangible assets would reduce our earnings, which in turn could negatively influence the price of our common stock. These difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses.                                          36   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The Company has international sales and facilities in the United Kingdom and Japan and therefore, is subject to foreign currency rate exposure. Non-U.S. sales are denominated in the functional currencies of the country in which our foreign subsidiaries reside. Total consolidated assets and liabilities of the Company are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each period presented. Accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders\\' equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in the Company\\'s results of operations, and were not material for the periods presented. As a result of operating in foreign markets, the Company\\'s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions. To the extent the Company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volumes paid in local currency, the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced. The Company has determined that the impact of a near-term 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. While the United Kingdom now contributes significantly to our revenues, we continue to believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk is low. Therefore the Company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk. However, this does not preclude the Company\\'s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future. As we continue to expand globally, the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.       As discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, \"Business Combinations\" and No. 142, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\", on July 1, 2001.                                            /S/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  Rochester, New York July 25, 2003                                          39                               HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                      YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001                 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  1.  BUSINESS       Harris Interactive Inc. (the \"Company\") is a leading global market research, polling and consulting firm, using Internet-based and traditional methodologies to provide clients with information about the views, behaviors and attitudes of people worldwide. Known for The Harris Poll (TM), the Company has over 45 years experience in providing clients with market research and polling services including custom, multi-client and service bureau research, in addition to customer relationship management services.  2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION       The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS       Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at date of purchase.    MARKETABLE SECURITIES       Harris Interactive Inc. accounts for its investments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No. 115, \"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\" All investments have been classified as available-for-sale securities as of June 30, 2003 and 2002. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in interest and other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT       Property, plant and equipment, including improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or extend useful life, are recorded at cost, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally 3 to 7 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, \"Accounting for the Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\" the Company assesses property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.    GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES       In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 141 (\"SFAS 141\"), \"Business Combinations,\" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 (\"SFAS 142\"), \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\" SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, thereby eliminating the pooling-of-interests method. Effective upon adoption, SFAS No. 142 eliminates the requirement to amortize goodwill and instead requires periodic testing of goodwill for impairment. If goodwill is impaired, it will be written down to its estimated fair value. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 142 did not result in an adjustment to recorded goodwill. Goodwill amortization expense was $330 in fiscal 2001. See also footnotes 16, 17 and 18.                                          44                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                      YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001  2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)    COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE       The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Position 98-1 \"Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use\" which accounts for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and identifies the characteristics of internal use software. Such amounts are included in other assets in the balance sheet and amounted to $1,485 and $1,628 at June 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Amortization expense related to these costs amounted to $1,072, $913 and $678 for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.    REVENUE RECOGNITION       The Company recognizes revenue from services principally on a proportional performance basis based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Subscription revenues are recognized upon delivery of the research project. Revenues include amounts billed to customers to cover subcontractor costs and other direct expenses. Provision for estimated contract losses, if any, is made in the period such losses are determined.    CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK       Financial instruments which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable as well as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Credit losses are provided for in the financial statements and have been within management\\'s expectations. In fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\\'s consolidated revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2001, the Company\\'s largest customer comprised 12% of total revenue and no other single customer comprised 10% of total revenue.    INCOME TAXES       The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company files separate state income tax returns in certain states and combined income tax returns in other states. The Company follows the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The Company has not provided any domestic income taxes applicable to the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as these amounts are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.    FOREIGN CURRENCY       For the Company\\'s subsidiaries outside of the United States, the local currency is the functional currency. In accordance with SFAS No. 52, \"Foreign Currency Translation,\" the financial statements of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars as follows: assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates; income, expenses and cash flows at average exchange rates; and stockholders\\' equity at historical exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.    ADVERTISING EXPENSES       Advertising expenses are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Such expenses amounted to $1,021, $1,275 and $1,653, for the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.                                          45                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                      YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001  2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)    RECLASSIFICATIONS       It is the Company\\'s policy to reclassify amounts in prior years\\' financial statements to conform to the current year\\'s presentation.    USE OF ESTIMATES       The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, if any, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS       Cash and accounts receivable are valued at their carrying or redemption amounts, which are reasonable estimates of their fair value. The fair value of all other instruments approximates cost.    INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE       Basic income (loss) per share amounts are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income (loss) per share reflects the assumed exercise and conversion of employee stock options that have an exercise price that is below the average market price of the common shares for the respective periods.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    SFAS 145       In May 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 145, \"Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections\". SFAS No. 145 eliminates the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of the related income tax effect. However, an entity is not prohibited from classifying such gains and losses as extraordinary items, so long as they meet the criteria outlined in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, \"Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of Disposal Occurring Events and Transactions. SFAS No. 145 also eliminates the inconsistency between the accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with early adoption encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS No. 145 on July 1, 2002. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 146       In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 146, \"Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities\". SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. Previous accounting guidance was provided by Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\") Issue No. 94-3, \"Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)\". SFAS No. 146 replaces EITF Issue No. 94-3. This                                          46                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                      YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001  2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)  standard is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 148       In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 148, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -- Transition and Disclosure.\" SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company is required to follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures required by SFAS No. 148 in its annual financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2003 and is also required to provide the disclosures in its quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods. The Company adopted SFAS 148 on January 1, 2003 and elects to continue to account for its stock based compensation plans under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees\" as are described in Note 14 of these Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 149       In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 149, \"Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.\" SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except for those provisions of SFAS No. 149 which relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 149 to have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    SFAS 150       In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 150, \"Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.\" SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or as an asset in some circumstances). SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and is otherwise effective for the Company beginning July 1, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 150 to have a material impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    FIN 45       In November 2002, the FASB published Interpretation No. 45, \"Guarantor\\'s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others.\" FIN 45 requires that a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee and also discusses additional disclosures to be made in the interim and annual financial statements of the guarantor regarding                                          47                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)                      YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, 2002 AND 2001  2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- (CONTINUED)  obligations under certain guarantees. The initial measurement and recognition requirements of FIN 45 are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted FIN 45 on January 1, 2003. The adoption did not have an impact on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.    FIN 46       In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, \"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities.\" This standard clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, \"Consolidated Financial Statements,\" and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities (more commonly known as Special Purpose Entities or SPE\\'s). FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved. FIN 46 also enhances the disclosure requirements related to variable interest entities.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS       On November 1, 2001 the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of Total Research Corporation (\"Total Research\"), a Delaware corporation, located in Princeton, New Jersey, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 5, 2001, among the Company, Total Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Total Research. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Total Merger Sub was merged with and into Total Research (the \"Merger\"), with Total Research continuing as the surviving corporation and as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Harris Interactive and Total Research are engaged in complementary businesses in the market research and polling industry. The acquisition has created revenue growth, cost savings and other synergies including the ability to convert Total Research traditional-based clients to the Internet, sell to one another\\'s customers, offer customers more comprehensive and diverse services, and use a combined worldwide network.       Upon consummation of the Merger, each outstanding share of Total Research common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.222 shares of Harris Interactive common stock, par value $.001 per share. An aggregate of approximately 16,610,000 shares of common stock, with an estimated fair value of $41,259, was issued to the stockholders of Total Research Corporation. The value was determined using the average fair market value of the stock for the range of trading days beginning August 2, 2001 and ending August 8, 2001. Additionally, pursuant to the merger agreement, all outstanding options to purchase shares of Total Research common stock were, upon consummation of the Merger, fully vested and converted into an option to purchase 1.222 shares of Harris Interactive common stock. As a result, the former option holders of Total Research received from Harris Interactive options to purchase approximately 2,899,000 shares of Harris Interactive common stock, with an estimated fair value of $3,609. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with FAS 141 and is included in the Company\\'s financial statements commencing on November 1, 2001.       The Company has recorded approximately $50,521 in goodwill and intangibles related to the acquisition in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142 (See Notes 16 and 17).       The pro forma information set forth below assumes the acquisition with Total Research Corporation had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2002, after giving effect to adjustments for amortization of intangibles. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated at that time.                                          48                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.

RESTRUCTURING (CREDITS) CHARGES AND ASSET WRITE-DOWNS       During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring and asset write-down charge of $6,222 directly related to the operational integration of Harris Interactive and Total Research. Management developed a formal plan that included a 5% reduction in Harris Interactive staff of the full-time workforce in Rochester, NY; New York, NY; Norwalk, CT and a few other outlying locations. The affected employees were mainly support staff with overlapping functions in the combined Company. Other integration actions included the closing of our telephone center located in Youngstown, OH and offices in New York, NY and Chicago, IL, which resulted in asset write-downs and a reserve for lease commitments at these locations. The plan was formally communicated to the affected employees during the second fiscal quarter of 2002.                                          49                              HARRIS INTERACTIVE INC.

A change in ownership could create a limitation on the amount of income that can be offset by net operating loss carryforwards and credits.       Deferred tax assets have been recognized to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized. Changes in facts, circumstances and projections may have an effect on the amount of the asset recognized in future periods.       The reversal of the valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets for temporary differences resulting from APB 16 purchase accounting is credited directly to goodwill, rather then income tax expense, resulting in zero net effect to the income statement. If the deferred assets underlying the valuation allowance are recognized, $3,192 of the valuation allowance would be credited to goodwill.       Of the June 30, 2003 valuation allowance, $5,217 was established against deferred tax assets associated with stock option deductions. The future reversal of this portion of the valuation allowance would be credited directly to additional paid in capital, which would result in no tax benefit recorded in the income statement.       The (benefit) provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before income taxes as follows:                                                                 2003     2002      2001                                                             ------   -------   -------     Expense (Benefit) at Federal statutory rate...............  $2,772   $(5,017)  $(8,167) State income tax benefit, net of Federal income tax.......     249      (938)   (1,162) Foreign rate differential.................................

STOCKHOLDERS\\' EQUITY    COMMON STOCK       In fiscal 2000, the Company amended the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized common stock to 100,000,000 shares. At June 30, 2003 and 2002 the Company had no outstanding Warrants.    EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN       The Company registered 500,000 shares of common stock in March 2000 for issuance under the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The ESPP provides employees with an opportunity to purchase the Company\\'s common stock through payroll deductions. Under the ESPP, the Company\\'s employees may purchase, subject to certain restrictions, shares of common stock at the lesser of 85 percent of the fair value at either the beginning or the end of each offering period. During fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, employees purchased 99,383, 104,507 and 145,143 shares of common stock through the ESPP, respectively.    TREASURY STOCK       In December 2000, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5,000 of its common stock at market prices. The amount and timing of any purchase will depend upon a number of factors, including the price and availability of the Company\\'s shares and general market conditions. The Company\\'s purchases of common stock are recorded as \"Treasury Stock\" and result in a reduction of \"Stockholders\\' Equity\" unless such shares are formally retired. As of June 30, 2003, the Company had repurchased and retired 655,600 shares of common stock, at a cost of $1,693 under such program.    INVESTOR STOCK OPTIONS       At June 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding options to acquire 12,220 and 244,400, respectively, shares of its common stock (not including options under the Company\\'s employee stock option plan, as discussed in Note 14 below), which represent options to acquire common stock of Total Research which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Merger.  13.  NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE       The following table presents the shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") for the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Unexercised stock options to purchase 564,343 shares of the Company\\'s common stock for the year ended June 30, 2003 at a weighted average price per share of $8.05 were not included in the computations of diluted earnings per share because the options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the Company\\'s common stock for fiscal 2003. As a result of losses from continuing operations, unexercised stock options to purchase 6,543,458 and 3,858,484 shares of the Company\\'s common stock for the years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively, at weighted average prices per share of $2.67 and $3.38, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would have been anti-dilutive.
