PART I           Item 1.     Business       General         Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. ( Streamline     Health®      or  the Company ) formerly known as LanVision Systems,     Inc. is a healthcare information technology company, which is     focused on developing and licensing proprietary software     solutions that improve document-centric information flows and     complement and enhance existing transaction-centric hospital     healthcare information systems. The Company s workflow and     document management solutions bridge the gap between current,     predominantly paper-based processes and transaction-based     healthcare information systems by 1) electronically     capturing document-centric information from disparate sources,     2) electronically directing that information through vital     business processes, and 3) providing access to the     information to authenticated users (such as physicians, nurses,     administrative and financial personnel and payers) across the     continuum of care. Streamline Health s systems are designed     for enterprise wide deployment to seamlessly connect disparate     departmental systems, or silos of independent technologies which     create Friction     PointsTM,     in a common interoperable document management workflow solution.         The Company s workflow-based products and services offer     solutions to specific healthcare business processes within the     Health Information Management (HIM) and revenue cycle, such as:     remote coding, abstracting and chart completion, remote     physician order processing, pre-admission registration scanning,     insurance verification, secondary billing services, explanation     of benefits processing, release of information processing and     other departmental workflow processes.         The Company s products and services also create an     integrated document-centric repository of historical health     information that is complementary to, and can be seamlessly      bolted on  to existing transaction-centric clinical,     financial and management information systems, allowing     healthcare providers to aggressively move toward fully     Electronic Medical Record (EMR) processes while improving     service levels and convenience for all stakeholders. These     integrated systems allow providers and administrators to     dramatically improve the availability of patient information     while decreasing direct costs associated with document     retrieval,     work-in-process,     chart completion, document retention and archiving.        1    Table of Contents         The Company s software solutions can be provided on a     subscription basis via remote application-hosting services or     licensed and installed locally. Streamline Health provides     ASPeNSM,     Application Service Provider-based remote hosting services to,     The University Hospital, a member of the Health Alliance of     Greater Cincinnati, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and     Children s Medical Center of Columbus, OH, among others. In     addition, Streamline Health has licensed its workflow and     document management solutions, which are installed at leading     healthcare providers including Stanford Hospital and Clinics,     the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, Beth Israel Medical     Centers, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Medical     University Hospital Authority of South Carolina, and     Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, among others.         The Company s applications allow authenticated users, such     as physicians, nurses, administrative and financial personnel,     and payers with access to patient healthcare information that     exists in disparate systems across the continuum of care and     improve operational efficiencies through business process     re-engineering and automating labor-intensive and demanding     paper environments. Streamline Health s applications and     services are complementary to existing clinical and financial     systems, and use document imaging and advanced workflow tools to     ensure users can electronically access both      structured  (transaction-centric) and      unstructured  (document-centric) patient data and all     the various forms of clinical and financial healthcare     information from a single permanent and secure repository,     including clinician s handwritten notes, laboratory     reports, photographs, insurance cards, etc.         The Company s workflow solutions offer value to all of the     constituents in the healthcare delivery process by enabling them     to simultaneously access and utilize Streamline Health s     advanced technological workflow applications to process     information, on a real-time basis from virtually any location,     including the Physician s desktop, using web-based     technology. Streamline Health s solutions integrate its own     proprietary imaging platform, application workflow modules and     image and web-enabling tools that allow for the seamless merger     of  back office  functionality with existing Clinical     and Financial Information Systems at the desktop.         The Company offers its own document imaging/management     infrastructure (Foundation Suite) that is built for high volume     transaction processing and is specifically designed for the     healthcare industry. In addition to providing access to     information not previously available at the desktop, Streamline     Health s applications fulfill the administrative and     regulatory needs of the Health Information Management, Patient     Financial Services and other hospital departments. Furthermore,     these systems have been specifically designed to integrate with     any Clinical Information System. For example, Streamline Health     has integrated its products with selected systems from Siemens     Medical Solutions USA Inc. (Siemens), Cerner Corporation, and     IDX Information Systems Corporation (IDX) (now part of GE     Medical see below) applications, thus enabling customers to use     our solutions without the expense of replacing entire software     systems to gain the software functionality. By offering     electronic access to all the patient information components of     the medical record, this integration completes one of the most     difficult tasks necessary to provide a true Electronic Medical     Record. Streamline Health s systems deliver on-line     enterprise wide access to fully updated patient information,     which historically was maintained on a variety of media,     including paper, magnetic disk, optical disk, and microfilm.         The Company operates in one segment as a provider of health     information technology solutions that streamline healthcare     information flows within a healthcare facility. The financial     information required by Items 101(b) of     Regulation S-K     is contained in Item 6 Selected Financial Information of     this     Form 10-K.         Historically, Streamline Health has derived most of its revenues     from recurring application-hosting services, recurring     maintenance fees, professional services and system sales     involving the licensing, either directly or through remarketing     partners, of its Health Information Management Workflow and     Revenue Cycle Management Workflow solutions to Integrated     Healthcare Delivery Networks (IDN). In a typical transaction,     Streamline Health, or its remarketing partners, enter into a     perpetual license or     fee-for-service     subscription agreement for Streamline Health s software     application suite and may license or sell other third-party     software and hardware components to the IDN. Additionally,     Streamline Health provides professional services, including     implementation, training, and product support.         Streamline Health earns its highest margins on proprietary     Streamline Health software and application-hosting services and     the lowest margins on third-party hardware and software. Sales     to customers may include different configurations of Streamline     Health software, hardware, third party software, and     professional services, resulting in        2    Table of Contents       varying margins among contracts. The margins on professional     services revenues fluctuate based upon the negotiated terms of     the agreement with each customer and Streamline Health s     ability to fully utilize its professional services, maintenance,     and support services staff.         Beginning in 1998, Streamline Health began offering customers     the ability to obtain its workflow solutions on an     application-hosting basis as an Application Service Provider     (ASP). Streamline Health established a hosting data center and     installed Streamline Health s suite of workflow products,     called ASPeN (Application Service Provider eHealth     Network) within the hosting data center. Under this arrangement,     customers electronically capture information and securely     transmit the data to the hosting data center. The     ASPeN services store and manage the data using     Streamline Health s suite of applications, and customers     can view, print, fax, and process the information from anywhere     using the Streamline Health web-based applications. Streamline     Health charges and recognizes revenue for these     ASPeN services on a per transaction or     subscription basis as information is captured, stored, retrieved     and processed.         The decisions by a healthcare provider to replace, substantially     modify, or upgrade its information systems are a strategic     decision and often involve a large capital commitment requiring     an extended approval process. Since inception, Streamline Health     has experienced extended sales cycles. It is not uncommon for     sales cycles to take six to eighteen months from initial contact     to the execution of an agreement. As a result, the sales cycles     can cause significant variations in     quarter-to-quarter     operating results. These agreements cover the licensing,     implementation and maintenance of the system, which typically     takes place in one or more phases. The licensing agreements     generally provide for the licensing of Streamline Health s     proprietary software and third-party software with a perpetual     or term license fee on either an unlimited number of users (site     license) or a specific number of users (concurrent users     license) that is adjusted upward depending on the number of     concurrent users using the software. Site-specific     customization, interfaces with existing customer systems and     other consulting services are sold on a fixed fee or a time and     materials basis. Alternatively, with Streamline Health s     ASP services solution, the application-hosting services     agreements generally provide for utilizing Streamline     Health s software and third-party software on a fee per     transaction or recurring subscription basis.     ASPeN services was designed to overcome obstacles     in the buying decision such as large capital commitment, length     of implementation, and the scarcity of time for Healthcare     Information Systems personnel to implement new systems.     Streamline Health believes that large IDN s and smaller     healthcare providers are looking for this type of ASP     application because of the ease of implementation and lower     entry-level costs. Streamline Health believes its business model     is especially well suited for the medium to small acute care     facility marketplace as well as the ambulatory marketplace and     is actively pursuing remarketing agreements, in addition to     those discussed below, with other Healthcare Information Systems     and staff outsourcing providers to distribute Streamline     Health s workflow solutions.         Generally, revenues from systems sales are recognized when an     agreement is signed and products are made available to     end-users. Revenue recognition related to routine installation,     integration and project management are deferred until the work     is performed. Revenues from consulting, training, and     application-hosting services are recognized as the services are     performed. Revenues from short-term support and maintenance     agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the     agreements. Billings to customers recorded prior to the     recognition of the revenue are classified as deferred revenues.     Revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are     recorded as contract receivables.         In 2002, Streamline Health entered into a five year Remarketing     Agreement with IDX Information Systems Corporation, which was     acquired by GE Healthcare, a unit of the General Electric     Company in January 2006. Under the terms of the Remarketing     Agreement, IDX was granted a non-exclusive worldwide license to     distribute all Streamline Health workflow software including     accessANYwareTM,     Coding Workflow, and ASPeN application-hosting     services to IDX customers and prospective customers, as defined     in the Remarketing Agreement. The Agreement has an automatic     annual renewal provision and, after the initial five year     period, can be cancelled by IDX upon 90 days written notice     to the Company. The Company believes that the agreement will be     renewed and will not be terminated.         Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with IDX (now part of     GE Healthcare), Streamline Health records this revenue when the     products are made available to end-users. Royalties are remitted     to Streamline Health        3    Table of Contents       based upon IDX sublicensing Streamline Health s software to     its customers. Thirty percent of the royalty is due 45 days     following the end of the month in which IDX executes an end-user     license agreement with its customer. The remaining seventy     percent of the royalty is due from IDX, in varying amounts based     on specific milestones, 45 days following the end of the     month in which a milestone occurs.         Streamline Health s quarterly operating results have varied     in the past and will continue to do so in the future because of     various reasons including: demand for Streamline Health s     products and services, long sales cycles, and extended     installation and implementation cycles based on customer s     schedules. Sales are often delayed because of customers      budgets and competing capital expenditure needs as well as     personnel resource constraints within an integrated delivery     network.         Delays in anticipated sales or installations have a significant     impact on Streamline Health s quarterly revenues and     operating results, because substantial portions of the operating     expenses are fixed.         The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in its     National Health Expenditure Projections released in January     2003, believes that health spending expenditures will reach $3.1     trillion in 2012, growing at an average annual rate of 7.3%     during the forecasted period     2002-2012.     As a share of the Gross Domestic Product, health spending is     projected to reach 17.7% by 2012 up from its 2002 level of     14.1%. Total spending on healthcare was $1.9 trillion in 2004,     over four times the amount spent on defense (source: National     Coalition on Health Care). Hospital spending accounted for 28%     of the growth in personal health spending between 1997 and 2000     and increased to 38% by 2002   2004. The federal     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projections indicate     that by 2015, health spending will account for 20% of the gross     domestic product, up from 16% in 2005 and the growth in spending     is projected to average 7.2% a year. In response to this     growth, the healthcare industry is undergoing significant change     as competition and cost-containment measures imposed by     governmental and private payers have created significant     pressures on healthcare providers to control healthcare costs     while providing quality patient care. At the same time, the     healthcare delivery system is experiencing a shift from a highly     fragmented group of non-allied healthcare providers to     integrated healthcare networks, which combine all of the     services, products and equipment necessary to address the needs     of healthcare customers. As a result, healthcare providers are     seeking to cut costs, increase productivity and enhance the     quality of patient care through improved access to information     throughout the entire hospital or integrated healthcare network.         In 2004, President Bush called for all Americans to have     electronic health records by 2014. Since then he has emphasized     health-care information technology in some very high-profile     speeches, including his 2007 State of the Union address, calling     it critical to making the United States health-care system more     efficient, affordable, and safe.         Today, the majority of the patient records are paper-based. The     inefficiencies of paper-based records increase the cost of     patient care. Physicians often cannot gain access to medical     records at the time of patient visits, and multiple users cannot     simultaneously access the record when only a single copy of the     paper-based patient record is available. Based upon Streamline     Health s experience in installing its systems, a typical     500 bed hospital can produce 15,000 to 20,000 pages of new     patient information each day even with computerized admission,     billing, laboratory and radiology systems, and individual     physician document retrieval requests can be as high as     100 documents per physician per day. The volume of medical     images in the patient record is expanding as well. In addition     to images such as x-rays and CAT scans, MRI s, new image     forms such as digitized slides, videos and photographs     proliferate. Thus, the ability to store and retrieve images of     voluminous paper records and medical images on a timely basis is     a critical feature of a complete Computerized Patient Record.         In order to simultaneously reduce costs and enhance the level of     patient care, hospitals and other healthcare providers are     requiring comprehensive, cost-effective information systems that     deliver rapid access to fully updated and complete patient     information. Traditional Healthcare Information Systems are     inadequate because: (i) they do not capture large amounts     of the patient records which are paper-based and stored in     various sites throughout the enterprise; (ii) computerized     patient data is generated using a variety of disparate systems     which cannot share information; and (iii) multimedia     medical information such as x-rays, CAT scans, MRI s, video     and audio information are frequently inaccessible at the point     of patient care. Accordingly, hospitals and other healthcare     providers have begun to increase their information systems     expenditures. In 2001, the eleventh Annual Healthcare     Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Leadership     Survey, healthcare business issues were driving Information     Technology priorities with over half of the respondents     indicating that cost pressures would        4    Table of Contents       continue to be a driving force in improving operational     efficiencies. Included in the top ten Information Technology     priorities was the implementation of Computerized Patient     Records. Respondents believe that implementing eHealth and HIPAA     (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of     1996) strategies (See Regulations Relating to     Confidentiality below) will consume most of the Information     Technology budget, because use of interactive eHealth solutions     has become a competitive advantage. Providers, payers and     suppliers know that the consequences of ignoring an eHealth     Strategy will result in the loss of market share.         Streamline Health believes that the HIPAA regulations are an     additional impetus for IDN s to embrace Streamline Health     products and services as a means of ensuring compliance with     Federal Regulations.         Document imaging and workflow (management) technologies are     essential elements of a complete EMR because they allow for the     storage of unstructured data (i.e., patient record elements     other than data or text, such as hand written physician or     nursing notes and physician orders, photographs, images of a     document) and they enable digitized x-rays, CAT scans,     MRI s, video and audio information to be accessed and     delivered to the caregiver at the point of patient care.     Streamline Health believes the demand for its Health Information     Management Workflow solutions, which can supply document-imaging     capabilities to the EMR, will increase in future years.         In addition to mandated HIPAA regulations, the healthcare     industry is being strongly encouraged by many professional     medical organizations to make greater use of information     technology. A report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the     National Academies, entitled To Err is Human: Building a     Better Health System, envisioned a revamped system that,     among other things, makes greater use of information technology     to enable providers and institutions to move away from     paper-based medical record systems to take advantage of new     information technology. The American Medical Association,     American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of     Physicians, American Society of Internal Medicine, and the     American College of Surgeons, issued a joint statement     supporting the IOM recommendations.     Regulatory     Matters         The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HSS)     asked the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of     Sciences to design a standardized model of an electronic health     record, in a move that may help spur nationwide acceptance of     EMR s. The impact of such a change, if implemented by HSS,     on current Streamline Health products and services is unknown at     this time. However, Streamline Health believes that its software     and systems are sufficiently flexible to accommodate changing     regulatory requirements. Also, in 2004, President Bush put forth     the goal of establishing EMR s for most Americans within     10 years. A national health-technology coordinator has been     appointed who reports to the Secretary of HSS. His     responsibility is specifically to create a plan to guide the     highly fragmented industry toward an interoperable electronic     medical records system. As noted in a Wall Street Journal     article dated July 21, 2004,  Putting such a system in     place can cost a major hospital $20 million or more. HSS     estimated then that in the U.S., only about 13% of hospitals had     adopted electronic health records for patients. As a result, the     health-care industry lags far behind most other industries in     using computers.  In 2005, President Bush appointed a     national coordinator for Health Information Technology in the     Health and Human Services Department. His task is to  give     every American an electronic medical record of their health care     by 2014, and link all the records into one giant medical     Internet, called the National Health Information Network.      HHS  will build the network s backbone and set the     standards for swapping data.  Physicians and hospitals will     have to pay for the computers, software, and other     infrastructure, which according to HSS is  estimated at up     to $150 billion over five years.      President s     Information Technology Advisory Committee         In 2004, the President s Information Technology Advisory     Committee issued its report entitled Revolutionizing Health     Care Through Information Technology, which focused on the      most fundamental and pervasive problem of healthcare     delivery: the paper-based medical record.  In the report,     they stated  the potential of information technology to     reduce the number of medical errors, reduce cost, and improve     patient care is enormous.        5    Table of Contents       The essence of our recommendations is a framework for     21st century health care information infrastructure that     revolutionizes medical records systems. The four core elements     of this framework are:         (1) Electronic health records for all Americans that     provide every patient and his or her caregivers the necessary     information required for optimal care while reducing costs and     administrative overhead.         (2) Computer-assisted clinical decision support to increase     the ability of health care providers to take advantage of     state-of-the-art     medical knowledge as they make treatment decisions (enabling the     practice of evidenced-based medicine).         (3) Computerized provider order entry   such as     for tests, medicine, and procedures   both for     outpatient care and within the hospital environment.         (4) Secure, private, interoperable, electronic health     information exchange, including both highly specific standards     for capturing new data and tools for capturing     non-standard-compliant electronic information from legacy     systems.          Streamline Health s current products and services can     currently be used to implement some of the recommendations or     provide interim solutions to some of the aspects recommended in     items 1, 3 & 4 above, especially with regard to     legacy, paper   based, medical information, order     entry systems, other than medication, and security of exchanging     health information.         Based on the Federal initiatives noted above, Streamline Health     believes that its product and services are able to support these     and other similar initiatives, and its products are currently     available and installed at leading healthcare facilities     throughout the U.S.     Regulations     Relating to Confidentiality         Federal and state laws regulate the confidentiality of patient     records and the circumstances under which such records may be     released. These regulations govern both the disclosure and use     of confidential patient health information. Regulations     governing electronic health data privacy are continuing to     evolve. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act     of 1996, enacted August 22, 1996, is designed to improve     the efficiency of healthcare by standardizing the interchange of     specified electronic data, and to protect the security and     confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI). The     legislation requires that covered entities comply with national     standards for certain types of electronic health information     transactions and the data elements used in such transactions,     and adopt policies and practices to ensure the integrity and     confidentiality of PHI.         Regulations adopted pursuant to HIPAA include rules addressing     several areas. Compliance with the new Privacy Rule was required     by most covered entities (other than small health plans) by     April 2003. The final Privacy Rule also extended the scope of     enforcement to PHI residing on non-electronic media, such as     paper, as well as to email, oral and written communications. The     regulations under the Security Rule were effective in April     2003, with a compliance date of April 2005. Small health plans     had until April 2006 to comply with the Security Rule. The     regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse     affect on our business. Streamline Health cannot predict the     potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet     been released or made final, or any other regulations that might     be adopted. Congress may adopt legislation that may change,     override, conflict with, or preempt the currently issued     regulations. Additionally, legislation governing the     dissemination of patient health information is also from time to     time proposed and debated at the state level. These laws or     regulations, when adopted, could restrict the ability of     customers to obtain, use, or disseminate patient health     information. Streamline Health believes that the features and     architecture of Streamline Health s products are such that     it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary     modifications to its products, if required, to ensure support of     the HIPAA regulations, and other legislation or regulations.         However, if the regulations are unduly restrictive, this could     cause delays in the delivery of new versions of products and     adversely effect the licensing of Streamline Health s     products. Overall, Streamline Health believes the HIPAA     regulations will continue to stimulate healthcare organizations     to purchase computer-based EMR systems that automate the     collection, use, and disclosure of patient health information,     while maintaining appropriate        6    Table of Contents       security and audit controls over the information. However, there     can be no assurance that an increase in the purchase of new     systems or additional use of Streamline Health     application-hosting services will occur.     Rapid     Technological Change and Evolving Market         The market for Streamline Health s products and services is     characterized by rapidly changing technologies, regulatory     requirements, evolving industry standards and new product     introductions and enhancements that may render existing products     obsolete or less competitive. As a result, Streamline     Health s position in the healthcare information technology     market could change rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the     features and functions of competing products, as well as the     pricing models for such products. Streamline Health s     future success will depend, in part, upon Streamline     Health s ability to enhance its existing products and     services and to develop and introduce new products and services     to meet changing requirements.     Changes     and Consolidation in the Healthcare Industry         Streamline Health derives substantially all of its revenues from     the licensing of software, providing professional services and     maintenance services and providing application-hosting services     within the healthcare industry. Accordingly, the success of     Streamline Health is dependent upon the regulatory and economic     conditions in the healthcare industry. Many healthcare providers     are consolidating to establish integrated delivery networks to     take advantage of economies of scale, greater marketing power     and greater leverage in negotiating with vendors who supply the     industry with the goods and services they require. The impact of     such consolidations, Streamline Health believes, will benefit     Streamline Health as more healthcare organizations investigate     methods to streamline operations, including outsourcing non-core     services to reduce costs and improve the quality of patient care     through the use of information technology, especially in the     paper intensive area of Patient Medical Records and Patient     Financial Services.     Key     Personnel         Streamline Health s success depends, to a significant     degree, on its management, sales and technical personnel.     Streamline Health must recruit, motivate and retain highly     skilled managers, and sales force, consulting and technical     personnel, including application programmers, database     specialists, consultants and system architects skilled in the     technical environments in which Streamline Health s     products operate. Competition for such technical expertise is     intense. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel     could have a material adverse impact on the Company.     Limited     Protection of Proprietary Technology         The success of Streamline Health depends on the protection of     its intellectual property rights relating to its proprietary     technology. Streamline Health relies on a combination of     confidentiality, nondisclosure, license, and employment     agreements, trade secret laws, copyrights, and restrictions on     the disclosure of its intellectual property. Notwithstanding     these precautions, others may copy, reverse engineer or design     independently, technology similar to Streamline Health s     products. It may be necessary to litigate to enforce or defend     Streamline Health s proprietary technology or to determine     the validity of the intellectual property rights of others.     Streamline Health could also be required to defend itself     against claims made by third parties for intellectual property     right infringement. Any litigation, could be successful or     unsuccessful, may result in substantial cost and require     significant attention by management and technical personnel.     Warranties     and Indemnities         Streamline Health s products are very complex and may not     be error free, especially when first released. Failure of any     Streamline Health product to operate in accordance with its     specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of     the license agreement and require Streamline Health to correct     the deficiency. If such deficiency is not corrected within the     agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be     corrected in a timely manner, it could constitute a material     breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and     possibly subjecting Streamline Health to a financial liability.     Also, Streamline Health indemnifies its customers against        7    Table of Contents       third-party infringement claims. If such claims are made, even     if they are without merit, they could be expensive to defend. If     Streamline Health becomes liable to a third-party for     infringement of their intellectual property, Streamline Health     could be required to pay substantial amounts as damages, obtain     a license to use the infringing technologies, develop its own     noninfringing technologies, or cease using the infringing     intellectual property.     Competition         Several companies historically have dominated the Healthcare     Clinical Information System software market and several of these     companies have either acquired, developed or are developing     their own document imaging and workflow technologies. The     industry is undergoing consolidation and realignment as     companies position themselves to compete more effectively.     Strategic alliances between vendors offering Health Information     Management Workflow and document imaging technologies and     vendors of other healthcare systems are increasing. Barriers to     entry to this market include technological and application     sophistication, the ability to offer a proven product, a     well-established customer base and distribution channels, brand     recognition, the ability to operate on a variety of operating     systems and hardware platforms, the ability to integrate with     pre-existing systems and capital for sustained development and     marketing activities. Streamline Health believes that these     barriers taken together represent a moderate to high level     barrier to entry. Foreign competition has not been a significant     factor in the market, to date.         Streamline Health has many competitors including Clinical     Information System vendors that are larger and more established     and have substantially more resources than Streamline Health. In     addition, information and document management companies serving     other industries may enter the market. Suppliers and companies     with whom Streamline Health may establish strategic alliances     may also compete with Streamline Health. Such companies and     vendors may either individually, or by forming alliances     excluding Streamline Health, place bids for large agreements in     competition with Streamline Health. A decision on the part of     any of these competitors to focus additional resources in the     image-enabling, workflow, and other markets addressed by     Streamline Health could have a material adverse effect on     Streamline Health.         Streamline Health believes that the principal competitive     factors in its market are customer recommendations and     references, company reputation, system reliability, system     features and functionality (including ease of use),     technological advancements, customer service and support,     breadth and quality of the systems, the potential for     enhancements and future compatible products, the effectiveness     of marketing and sales efforts, price and the size and perceived     financial stability of the vendor. In addition, Streamline     Health believes that the speed with which companies in its     market can anticipate the evolving healthcare industry structure     and identify unmet needs are important competitive factors.     There can be no assurance that Streamline Health will be able to     compete successfully in the future against existing or potential     competitors.         Streamline Health believes that its principal competitors are:     American Management Systems, Incorporated; Cerner Corporation;     Eclipsys Corporation; Hyland Software, Inc.; McKesson HBOC,     Inc.; MedPlus, Inc. (a subsidiary of Quest Diagnostics     Incorporated); Perceptive Vision, Inc.; Siemens Medical     Solutions USA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Siemens AG); and SoftMed     Systems, Inc., which was recently acquired by 3M.     The     Streamline Health Solution         Streamline Health s products and services streamline     information flows and provide Health Information Management     Workflow, Patient Financial Services and other departmental     Workflow solutions for the patient and other information access     needs of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks.     Streamline Health s systems enable medical and     administrative personnel to rapidly and efficiently capture,     store, manage, route, retrieve and process vast amounts of     clinical, financial, patient and other information.         Streamline Health s systems:  (i) capture     and store electronic data from disparate hospital information     systems through real-time, computerized interfaces;     (ii) provide applications for efficiently scanning and     automatically indexing paper-based records; (iii) allow     storage of a patient s lifetime medical record on secure     media which also provides rapid access to high volumes of data     enterprise wide; (iv) provide technologically advanced     workflow automation software to facilitate the re-engineering of     business processes; and (v) incorporate        8    Table of Contents   physician-oriented     interfaces that allow the user to easily locate and retrieve     patient information in the hospital or clinical setting,     including the point of patient care.         Streamline Health s Health Information Management Workflow     and Patient Financial Services Workflow solutions provide     financial, administrative, and clinical benefits to the     healthcare provider and facilitate more effective patient care.     These benefits include: (i) improved access to patient     information to assist in making informed clinical and financial     decisions; (ii) reduced costs for administrative personnel     due to increased workflow efficiency, as data can be routed     within an organization to all users who need to process that     information simultaneously or in sequence as required;     (iii) increased productivity through the elimination of     file contention by providing multiple users simultaneous access     to patient medical records;(iv) reduced costs and improved care     through the reduction of unnecessary testing and admissions;     (v) improved cash flow through accelerated account     receivable collections and reductions in  technical     denials  (which occur when a third-party payer refuses     payment because of the provider s inability to substantiate     billing claims due to loss of portions or all of the patient     record); (vi) expedited treatment decisions, and fewer     redundant tests as a result of timely access to complete     information; (vii) fewer medical record errors by     minimizing misfiled, lost and improperly completed records; and     (viii) increased security of patient information through     improved controls on access to confidential data and the     creation of audit trails that identify the persons who accessed     or even tried to access such information.     The     Streamline Health Strategy         Streamline Health s objective is to continue to be a     leading provider of Health Information Management and Patient     Financial Services Workflow solutions to the healthcare     industry. Important elements of Streamline Health s     business strategy include:     Expand     Distribution Channels         Streamline Health estimates the total market for Streamline     Health s document management products and services could be     in excess of $16 billion, and the market is less than 15%     penetrated. A 2001 healthcare industry report stated that in     order to comply with the HIPAA healthcare information electronic     transmission regulations, healthcare systems will need to adjust     existing systems or purchase new Information Technology systems,     hire and retrain staff, and make significant changes to the     current processes associated with maintaining patient privacy,     the cost of which is estimated to be somewhere between three to     four times the amount of expenditures required for Year 2000     remediation, or an amount in excess of $25 billion.     Streamline Health strongly believes its highly evolved, secure     and technologically advanced web browser-based ASP solutions     will position Streamline Health to take advantage of, what it     continues to believe will be, significantly increasing market     opportunities for Streamline Health and its distribution     partners in the future.         In 2002, Streamline Health entered into a five-year Remarketing     Agreement with IDX (now GE Healthcare), which offers a wide     variety of patient care products to integrated delivery     networks, group practices, academic medical centers,     radiological centers, and hospitals nationwide. IDX has     installed its products at more than 2,600 customer sites     with systems deployed to serve over 120,000 physicians. Under     the terms of the Agreement, IDX was granted a non-exclusive     worldwide license to distribute all Streamline Health     applications and ASPeN services to IDX     customers and prospective customers, as defined in the     Agreement. GE Healthcare sells Streamline Health s Health     Information Management and enterprise document management and     document Workflow solutions as an integrated component of the GE     Centricity®     Enterprise clinical and financial information systems. The     Agreement has an automatic annual renewal provision and, after     the initial five year period, can be cancelled by IDX upon     90 days written notice to the Company. The Company believes     that the agreement will be renewed and will not be terminated.         It is Streamline Health s intention to develop additional     remarketing alliances with other Healthcare Information Systems,     Medical Records management, and Medical Records outsourcing     vendors and to explore other means of expanding Streamline     Health s distribution channels.        9    Table of Contents     Application     Service Provider Application-hosting Services         In 1998, Streamline Health began offering customers the ability     to obtain its workflow solutions on an application-hosting basis     as an ASP. Streamline Health established a hosting data center     and installed Streamline Health s suite of workflow     products, called ASPeN within the hosting data     center, which utilizes Streamline Health s web     browser-based applications across an Internet/Intranet, to     deliver high quality, transaction-based services to healthcare     providers from a centrally located data center.     ASPeN enables its healthcare customers to achieve     enhanced patient care, improved security, and accessibility to     patient records at significant cost savings with minimal     up-front capital investment, maintenance, and support costs.     Customers realize benefits more quickly with less economic risk.     Customers are charged on a per transaction or subscription     basis, which is an attractive alternative to purchasing an     in-house system. This service is made possible through the     advancement of web browser-based technology,     state-of-the-art     communication technology and advanced software design.     Maintain     Technological Leadership Through the Development of New Software     Applications and Increased Functionality of Existing     Applications         Streamline Health intends to continue its product development     efforts and increase the functionality of existing applications     along with the development of new applications using workflow     technologies. In particular, Streamline Health intends to     increase the functionality of its web-based applications.     Streamline Health has continued to add new features,     functionality and workflow applications to its suite of     products, including revenue cycle management solutions such as     remote coding, remote physician order processing, pre-admission     registration scanning, insurance verification, denial     management, secondary billing services, explanation of benefits     processing, etc. (See  A brief description of Streamline     Health s products  below.)         Streamline Health has released its latest generation product,     accessANYware, a web-based application with a user interface     that includes the best features of Streamline Health s     entire product portfolio. The accessANYware application utilizes     a common database for medical records and patient financial     services, thereby improving system administration and     eliminating redundant data entry.         Streamline Health has implemented its first hospital revenue     cycle product, Coding Workflow, an application that     provides workflow automation of the coding and abstracting     process by allowing hospital personnel to electronically access     documents to be coded and abstracted from remote locations,     including the employee s home. The Coding Workflow product     can also be integrated with third-party encoding or abstracting     software thus avoiding redundant data entry.         Streamline Health believes only the most robust, flexible,     dependable products will survive in the healthcare market, and     Streamline Health has attempted to establish itself as a leader     in document imaging/management and workflow applications through     strong product development.     Image-Enable     Clinical Data Repositories and Other Applications     Software         Today, healthcare information is often stored on numerous     dissimilar host-based and departmental systems that are spread     throughout an enterprise and are not integrated. Additionally,     these current systems do not address the data stored on paper or     the increasing volume of medical images such as CAT scans,     MRI s, digitized slides, exploratory scopes, photographs,     audio, etc. Streamline Health believes the efficiencies and     productivity of hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery     networks can be greatly enhanced by seamlessly integrating their     historical information systems with document imaging and     workflow applications. Physicians, clinicians, and other     healthcare users then have access to the complete patient     medical record, including the structured data, such as     laboratory results, and related unstructured data, or a     doctor s hand written notes. Streamline Health has     image-enabled many popular Clinical Data Repositories, such as     those offered by Oacis Healthcare Holdings Corp., GE Healthcare,     and Cerner Corporation. Streamline Health is marketing     image-enabling technology through its accessANYware and the     Streamline Health Integration Tools. Streamline Health intends     to continue to aggressively market its unique image-enabling     solutions to end-users and other third-party software     application providers. Streamline Health has several large     scale, enterprise wide image enabled sites, including Memorial     Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which utilizes Streamline     Health s solution on over 7,000 workstations and over 1,150     simultaneous users at any point in time.        10    Table of Contents     Systems     and Services         Streamline Health s systems employ an open architecture     that supports a variety of operating systems, including     Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 2000 and 2003, and UNIX.     Streamline Health s systems can be configured with various     hardware platforms, including INTEL-compatible personal     computers. Streamline Health s systems include a user     interface designed specifically by Streamline Health for     physicians and other medical and administrative personnel in     hospitals and integrated healthcare networks. Streamline     Health s systems operate on multiple imaging platforms,     including Siemens and FileNet in addition to its own proprietary     document imaging platform. Streamline Health s Health     Information Management Workflow solutions incorporate advanced     features, including workflow and security features, which allow     customers to restrict direct access to confidential patient     information, secure patient data from unauthorized indirect     access and have audit trail features.         A brief description of Streamline Health s products follows:         Streamline Health products and services are built using advanced     document imaging/management and workflow automation technologies     to create robust Medical Records and Revenue Cycle Workflow     solutions. Document imaging technology makes paper-based     information, as well as medical images, sound and video     information as readily available and easy to process as     traditional electronic data. In addition to intelligent     electronic routing of documents, workflow automation offers     sophisticated management tools and reporting to increase     efficiency and support of business process re-engineering     efforts.         Streamline Health s products and services were designed to     be complementary with existing third-party HIS and ASP-based     services, providing value-added functionality to these     third-party applications, including the following:                          The ability to gain seamless electronic access to medical     records, business office documents and medical images     (unstructured data);                     Workflow-based automated chart deficiency analysis and     completion;                     Workflow-based automated release of information and billing;                     Workflow-based remote coding and seamless integration to     third-party encoder and abstracter software;                     Workflow-based physician order routing for scheduling;                     Workflow-based financial screening and routing of patient     financial ability to pay information;                     Computer-aided data extraction solutions using OCR technology to     scan, extract, verify, and input into existing information     systems data;           Streamline Health has developed innovative application tool sets     to  image and web-enable  existing HIS clinical and     patient financial services applications, thereby allowing users     to have a common graphical user interface on a universal     workstation. Streamline Health has also developed its own     document imaging middleware to efficiently provide the     object-oriented business processes common to all of its     applications, such as scanning/indexing, faxing/printing, data     archiving migration, security and auditing. Through its     application software, document imaging middleware, and its     workflow, image and web-enabling tools, Streamline Health allows     the seamless merging of its Medical Record and Patient Financial     Services department  back office  functionality with     existing clinical information systems at the desktop.         For maximum flexibility, accessANYware, the current Streamline     Health product portfolio, is packaged into four distinct     offerings: (i) the Health Information Management (HIM)     Suite, (ii) the Patient Financial Services (PFS) Suite,     (iii) the Enterprise Suite; and (iv) a set of     Productivity Tools.         The accessANYware family of products is Streamline Health s     fifth-generation document-centric repository of historical     health information that is complementary to and can be     seamlessly  bolted on  to existing transaction-centric     clinical, financial and management information systems, allowing     healthcare providers to aggressively move toward a true EMR. It     allows authorized users to perform document searching,     retrieval, viewing, processing, printing and faxing, as well as     report generation   all from a single login.        11    Table of Contents     HEALTH     INFORMATION MANAGEMENT Suite         The HIM Suite includes accessANYware   Patient     Folders, Completion Workflow, Release Workflow, and Coding     Workflow.     accessANYware       Patient Folders         accessANYware   Patient Folders is a web-based     application that provides hospital organizations the ability to     electronically store, search and retrieve medical records from     any location within the facility, physician offices, off-site     clinics and even from home. In addition,     accessANYware   Patient Folders provides a complete     web-based chart deficiency management system that includes     analysis, electronic signature and management     reports   all from a single login.     accessANYware   Patient Folders allows the user to     securely view the entire medical record from a visit view or a     category-based longitudinal view of historical patient     information.     Completion     Workflow         The Completion Workflow application is a chart deficiency     management workflow that provides management reporting along     with providing analysts and clinicians the ability to remotely     analyze, electronically sign and complete deficient records. In     addition to a single login, accessANYware delivers a single user     interface and integrated database. Therefore, from a single     system login, users with appropriate security have the ability     to search and retrieve information regarding patients and cases     (for chart analysis), view, print and fax patient documents, as     well as analyze or complete deficient documents. The functions     presented to the user vary with the user s security. For     example, if the user is a clinician,     he/she is     presented with an inbox function that displays a list of     incomplete charts (awaiting completion) and a list of      linked  patients assigned to them. The clinician then     has the option to complete deficient charts or retrieve patient     information via searching or by clicking on the      linked  patients within their inbox. This access may     occur from any workstation within the facility, the     physician s office, or some other remote site. With proper     security, the user is able to view, print and fax patient     information.     Release     Workflow         Streamline Health clients also have the option of further     enhancing the productivity of their operations through the     release workflow module which fulfills internal and external     requests for patient information and allows for automatic     invoicing capability. It also provides the ability to     electronically search for, print, mail or fax information to     third parties that request copies of patient records.     Coding     Workflow         Due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel, there     currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and     retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more     efficient. The Coding Workflow module provides workflow     automation of the coding and abstracting process by allowing     hospital personnel to electronically access documents to be     coded and abstracted from remote locations, including the     employee s home. It may also be integrated with third-party     encoding or abstracting software, avoiding redundant data entry.     PATIENT     FINANCIAL SERVICES Suite         The PFS Suite includes accessANYware   Non Patient     Folders, Referral Order Workflow, and Cash Posting Workflow.     accessANYware       Non Patient Folders         accessANYware   Non Patient Folders is a web-based     application that allows any department of a healthcare     organization the ability to store, retrieve and process     document-centric information using a site-defined electronic     folder hierarchy with a user-friendly interface.     accessANYware   Non Patient        12    Table of Contents       Folders provides document imaging and workflow capabilities for     a hospital organization s enterprise-wide departmental     needs, such as Patient Financial Services, Business Office,     Human Resources, Materials Management, Medical Staff Office,     Purchasing and virtually any other department that has document     intensive storage, retrieval and processing needs.     Referral     Order Workflow         Referral Order Workflow   provides automatic routing     of physician orders to the appropriate personnel for scheduling     patient appointments.     Cash     Posting Workflow         Cash Posting Workflow   provides the ability to import     electronic remittances directly into individual patient     accounts; OCR to scan and electronically capture Explanation of     Benefits (EOB) information resulting in the ability to post     payments directly from the remittance document image, and cash     posting assistant to index EOB s to the account folder     while posting.     Enterprise     Suite         The Enterprise Suite is a full offering of Streamline Health     products including the HIM Suite, the PFS Suite, and the     Streamline Health Integration Tools.     The     Streamline Health Integration Tools     (STRM-ITTM)         STRM-IT supports powerful image-enabling and workflow technology     that allows healthcare users to immediately and simultaneously     access any patient information, including multimedia and     paper-based information, through their existing third-party     clinical or billing applications. As a result, any application     across the entire enterprise can be image-enabled, including the     host Healthcare Information Systems, Patient Billing Systems,     Clinical Data Repositories and others. When the Clinical Data     Repository is image-enabled, users can access any piece of     information on the same workstation and from the same screen     display, including the point of patient care. This means users     can view traditional electronic data and images simultaneously     on the same screen without signing in and out of multiple     applications.     ASPeN...Application     Service Provider eHealth Network         Streamline Health s Hosting Services (ASPeN)     offers healthcare organizations an ever increasing,     cost-effective solution to manage its information. Through the     use of the Internet and private line telecommunications,     Streamline Health provides its healthcare customers with fast     and secure access to its data stored at Streamline Health s     data center, for a monthly subscription fee. The hosted pricing     model helps its healthcare customers to overcome the barriers of     high capital and     start-up     costs as well as the technological burdens of implementing and     managing a document workflow system.     Professional     Services         Streamline Health provides a full complement of professional     services to implement its software applications. Streamline     Health believes that high quality consulting and professional     implementation services are important to attracting new     customers and maintaining existing customer satisfaction. These     services include implementation and training, project     management, business process re-engineering, and custom software     development. The implementation and training services include     equipment and software installation, system integration and     comprehensive training. The project management services include     needs and cost/benefit analysis, hardware and software     configuration and business process re-engineering. The custom     software development services include interface, workflow and     report development.        13    Table of Contents     Research     and Development         Streamline Health continues to focus its research and     development efforts to develop new application software and     increase the functionality of existing applications. Customer     requirements and desires significantly influence Streamline     Health s research and development efforts.         Product research and development expense was $2,716,163,     $2,733,293, and $2,061,207 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.     In addition, Streamline Health also capitalized approximately     $2,130,000, $1,450,000, and $1,000,000 of software development     expenditures in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.     Existing     Customers         Streamline Health s customers include healthcare providers     located throughout the United States. Streamline Health has     implemented or is in the process of implementing one or more of     its systems in the following representative list of healthcare     institutions:         Albert Einstein Healthcare Network, Philadelphia, PA     Beth Israel Medical Center, New York, NY     Children s Medical Center of Dallas, Dallas, TX     Christiana Care Health Services, New Castle, DE     Medical University Hospital Authority:       Medical University of South Carolina, Columbia,     SC     Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY     OhioHealth Corporation:       Grant/Riverside Methodist Hospitals, Columbus, OH          ProMedica Health Systems, Toledo, OH     Sarasota Memorial Hospital, Sarasota, FL     Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Palo Alto, CA     Texas Health Resources, Inc., Arlington, TX      UPMC Health System, Pittsburgh, PA     ASPeN Application-hosting Customers include:         Children s Hospital, Columbus, OH     Health Alliance of Greater Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH     M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX     University of California, School of Medicine,     San Francisco, CA     Pattie A. Clay Regional Medical Center, Richmond, KY     RevenueMed, Inc., Alpharetta, GA         GE Healthcare has also sublicensed Streamline Health s     suite of products or its ASPeN Services to eleven healthcare     organizations.         In fiscal year 2006, GE Healthcare, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center     and Texas Health Resources, Inc., accounted for 28%, 11% and 8%,     respectively, of Streamline Health s total revenues. In     fiscal year 2005, Texas Health Resources, Inc., GE Healthcare,     and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, accounted for 18%, 12% and     11%, respectively, of Streamline Health s total revenues.     In fiscal year 2004, GE Healthcare, M. D. Anderson Cancer     Center, and OhioHealth Corporation accounted for 21%, 13% and     13%, respectively, of Streamline Health s total revenues.         The small number of customers, the dependence on remarketing     partner GE Healthcare, and extended sales cycles has contributed     to variability in quarterly and annual operating results.     Streamline Health expects that as its customer base continues to     increase and sales through its Remarketing Agreements increase,     the actions of any one customer will have less of an effect on     its quarterly and annual operating results. The loss of a major     customer or the remarketing partner GE Healthcare could have a     material adverse effect on Streamline Health.        14    Table of Contents     Signed     Agreements   Backlog         See also ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       Backlog, for an explanation of the current year backlog compared     with the prior year backlog.         Streamline Health enters into master agreements with its     customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed     and/or     services to be provided by Streamline Health, the agreed upon     aggregate price and the timetable for implementation. The master     agreement typically provides that Streamline Health will deliver     the system in phases, thereby allowing the customer flexibility     in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments     that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in     customer needs. The master agreement also allows the customer to     request additional components as the installation progresses,     which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and     terms. Historically, customers have ultimately purchased systems     and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the     master agreement, although there can be no assurance that this     trend will continue in the future.         At January 31, 2007, Streamline Health has master     agreements and purchase orders from remarketing partners for     systems and related services (excluding support and maintenance,     and transaction-based revenues for the application-hosting     services) that have not been delivered, installed which, if     fully performed, will generate future revenues of approximately     $5,226,000. The related products and services are expected to be     delivered over the next two to three years. Furthermore,     Streamline Health has entered into application-hosting     agreements, which are expected to generate revenues in excess of     $5,256,000 through their respective renewal dates in fiscal     years 2007 through 2012.         Streamline Health s master agreements also generally     provide for a limited initial maintenance period and require the     customer to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a     monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. Maintenance and support     revenues for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 were     approximately $5,617,000, $5,104,000, and $5,220,000,     respectively. Maintenance and support revenues are expected to     increase in the future. At January 31, 2007, Streamline     Health had Maintenance Agreements and purchase orders from     remarketing partners for maintenance, which if fully performed,     will generate future revenues of approximately $4,469,000,     through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year 2007 and     2008.         The commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the     size and complexity of the system, the implementation schedule     requested by the customer and usage by customers of the     application-hosting services. Therefore, Streamline Health is     unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve     in any particular period. Streamline Health s master     agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its     agreement upon a material breach by Streamline Health, or may     delay certain aspects of the installation. There can be no     assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of     a master agreement or delay installations. A termination or     installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the     failure of Streamline Health to procure additional agreements,     could have a material adverse effect on Streamline Health s     business, financial condition, and results of operations.     Royalties         Streamline Health incorporates software licensed from various     vendors into its proprietary software. In addition, third-party,     stand-alone software is required to operate Streamline     Health s proprietary software. Streamline Health licenses     these software products, and pays the required royalties     and/or     license fees when such software is delivered to Streamline     Health s customers.     Employees         As of January 31, 2007, Streamline Health had     105 full-time employees, an increase of 11 during the     fiscal year. In addition, Streamline Health utilizes independent     contractors to supplement its staff, as needed. None of     Streamline Health s employees are represented by a labor     union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.     Streamline Health has never experienced a work stoppage and     believes that its employee relations are good.        15    Table of Contents         Copies of documents filed by Streamline Health Solutions, Inc.     with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including annual     reports on     Form 10-K,     quarterly reports on     Form 10-Q,     current reports on     Form 8-K,     etc., and all amendments to those reports, if any, can be found     at the web site www.streamlinehealth.net as soon as     practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or     furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Risk     Factors           See also, PART I, ITEM 1, BUSINESS.         The following is a list of risk factors that affect the Company.     They are not listed in any particular order or relative     importance and no inferences should be given to the listing     order.     The     variability of quarterly operating results can be     significant.                The Company s future revenues and operating results may     vary significantly from     quarter-to-quarter     as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside     the control of the Company. These factors include the relatively     large size of customer agreements, unpredictability in the     number and timing of system sales, length of the sales cycle,     delays in installations and changes in customer s financial     condition or budgets.     The     Company needs to manage its     growth.         The Company is currently experiencing a period of growth and     expansion which has placed, and could continue to place, a     significant strain on the Company s services and support     operations, sales and administrative personnel and other     resources. Streamline Health believes that it must expand the     workforce to develop new products enhance existing products and     serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base.     The Company s ability to successfully expand its operations     will depend, in large part, upon its ability to attract and     retain highly qualified employees. The Company s ability to     manage its planned growth effectively also will require the     Company to continue to improve its operational, management, and     financial systems and controls, to train, motivate, and manage     its employees and to increase its operating expenses in     anticipation that such growth will increase future revenues.     The     Company could be less profitable than     expected.         Because of the relatively fixed operating expenses and overhead,     the future profitability of the Company is dependent on     increasing revenues which may not materialize as anticipated.     Sales     have been concentrated in a small number of     customers.         The Company s revenues have been concentrated in a     relatively small number of large customers, and the Company has     historically derived a substantial percentage of its total     revenues from a few customers. There can be no assurance that a     customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master     agreement or delay installations. A termination or installation     delay of one or more phases of an agreement, or the failure of     Streamline Health to procure additional agreements, could have a     material adverse effect on Streamline Health s business,     financial condition, and results of operations. The     Company s major reseller could choose to discontinue     reselling Streamline Health products, and significant customers     could elect to discontinue using our products. The Company needs     to ensure that it expands the distribution channels to reduce     the reliance on a single major reseller and expand the customer     base to ensure that the loss of a customer is not a significant     loss in total revenues.        16    Table of Contents     Streamline     Health faces significant competition, including from companies     with significantly greater     resources.                The Company currently competes with many other companies for the     licensing of similar software products and related services.     Many of these companies are larger than Streamline Health and     have significantly more resources to invest in their business.     Streamline     Health s intellectual property rights are valuable, and any     inability to protect them could reduce the value of Streamline     Health s products and     services.                The Company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property,     which represents an important asset to the Company. Streamline     Health does not have any patent protection on any of its     software. The Company relies upon license agreements, employment     agreements, confidentiality, nondisclosure agreements, etc. to     maintain the confidentiality of Streamline Health s     proprietary information and trade secrets. If the Company fails     to adequately protect the intellectual property through     trademarks and copyrights, license agreements, employment     agreements, confidentiality, nondisclosure agreements, etc., the     intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others,     invalidated, or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate     the Company s technology or may otherwise limit any     competitive technology advantage the Company may have. Also, the     Company could be subject to intellectual property infringement     claims as the number of software patents and copyrighted and     trademarked materials are produced as our software functionality     is expanded. Any claim, even if not meritorious, would be     expensive to defend, and if the Company were to become liable     for infringing third party intellectual property rights, the     Company could be liable for substantial damage awards, and     potentially be required to cease using the technology, produce     noninfringing technology or obtain a license to use such     technology.         Due to the rapid pace of technology change, the Company believes     its future success is likely to depend upon continued     innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer     support and services rather than on legal protection of our     property rights. However, the Company has in the past, and     intends in the future, to aggressively assert its intellectual     property rights when necessary.     Rapid     technology changes and short product life cycles could harm     Streamline Health s     business.                The technology underlying Streamline Health s product is     subject to rapid change including the potential introduction of     new products and technologies, which may have a material,     adverse impact on its business, operating results, and financial     condition. The Company needs to maintain an ongoing research and     development program to continue to develop new products and     apply new technologies to the existing products.     The     impact of new or changes in existing federal, state, and local     regulations governing healthcare information.         Healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material     adverse affect on business. However, the Company cannot predict     the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not     yet been released or made final, or any other regulations that     might be adopted. Congress may adopt legislation that may     change, override, conflict with, or preempt the currently issued     regulations. Additionally, legislation governing the     dissemination of patient health information is also from     time-to-time     proposed and debated at the state level. These laws or     regulations, when adopted, could restrict the ability of     customers to obtain, use, or disseminate patient health     information. Streamline Health believes that the features and     architecture of Streamline Health s products are such that     it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary     modifications to its products, if required, to ensure support of     the HIPAA regulations, and other legislation or regulations.     The     loss of key personnel could adversely affect Streamline     Health s     business.                Streamline Health s success depends, to a significant     degree, on its management, sales force and technical personnel.     The Company must recruit, motivate, and retain highly skilled     managers, consulting and technical personnel, including     application programmers, database specialists, consultants, and     system architects who have the requisite expertise in the     technical environments in which our products operate.     Competition for such technical expertise is intense.        17    Table of Contents     Streamline     Health software may not be error free and could result in claims     of breach of contract and     liabilities.         Streamline Health software products are very complex and may not     be error free, especially when first released. Although the     Company performs extensive testing, failure of any product to     operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation     could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require     Streamline Health to correct the deficiency. If such deficiency     is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations     on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner, it     could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the     termination thereof and possibly subjecting the Company to     liability. Streamline Health s license agreement generally     limits the Company s liability arising from such claims but     such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or     under some circumstances. A significant uninsured or     under-insured judgment against the Company could have a material     adverse impact on the Company.     The     application-hosting services and support services could     experience     interruptions.                The Company provides hosting services for certain clients,     including the storage of critical patient and administrative     data. In addition, it provides support services to clients     through the client support facility. The Company has     redundancies, such as backup generators and redundant     telecommunications lines, built into its operations to prevent     disruptions. However, complete failure of all generators or     impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty     damage to the building or equipment inside the buildings housing     our data center or client support facilities could cause a     disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend     on the application hosting services. Any interruption in     operations at its data center or client support facility could     cause the Company to lose existing clients, impede our ability     to obtain new clients, result in revenue loss, cause potential     liability to our clients, and increase our operating costs.     Third     party products are essential to Streamline Health s     software.                Streamline Health software incorporates software licensed from     various vendors into its proprietary software. In addition,     third-party, stand-alone software is required to operate the     Company s proprietary software. The loss of the ability to     use these third party products, or ability to obtain substitute     third party software at comparable prices, could have a material     adverse affect on the ability to license Streamline Health     software.     The     Company could be liable to customers or third     parties.                The Company s systems provide access to patient information     used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing     medical care. The medical care provided by physicians and other     medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice     and other claims. The Company attempts to limit any potential     liability of the Company to customers by limiting the warranties     on its systems in the Company s agreements with healthcare     provider. However, such agreements do not protect the Company     from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from     any or all persons or entities connected to the process of     delivering patient care. The Company maintains insurance, which     provide limited protection from such claims, if they are     successfully litigated. Although no such claims have been     brought against the Company to date regarding injuries related     to the use of our software solutions, such claims may be made in     the future. A significant uninsured or under-insured judgment     against the Company could have a material adverse impact on the     Company.     The     Company needs to continuously anticipate future events, such as     changes in regulations that could affect its products, and the     probability of natural disasters, catastrophes, war, or     terrorism     etc.                The Company may not correctly anticipate such future events     which could have a material adverse impact on the Company.         In addition, risks and uncertainties not currently known to the     Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial     also may materially adversely affect the Company, its financial     condition     and/or     operating results.        18    Table of Contents     Item 1B.  Unresolved     Staff Comments          None           Item 2.     Properties           Streamline Health s principal offices are located at 10200     Alliance Road, Suite 200, Cincinnati,     OH 45242-4716.     The offices consist of approximately 21,700 square feet of     space under a lease that expires in July 2010. In addition,     Streamline Health leases dedicated collocation high security     data center space in the Cincinnati, OH area, for its     ASPeN Services, application-hosting data center     operations, which lease expires in June 2007, but has automatic     renewal provisions. The current rental expense for all of these     facilities approximates $368,000 annually.         Streamline Health believes that its facilities are adequate for     its current needs and that suitable alternative space is     available to accommodate expansion of Streamline Health s     operations.

In addition, the stock market, in general, has     experienced price and volume fluctuations which have     particularly affected the market price of high technology     companies and which have been often unrelated to the operating     performance of a specific company. Many technology companies,     including Streamline Health, experience significant fluctuations     in the market price of their equity securities. There can be no     assurance that the market price of the Common Stock will not     decline, or otherwise continue to experience significant     fluctuations in the future.         (b) According to the stock transfer agent records,     Streamline Health had 140 stockholders of record as of     April 2, 2007. Because brokers and other institutions on     behalf of stockholders hold many of such shares, Streamline     Health is unable to determine with complete accuracy the current     total number of stockholders represented by these record     holders. Streamline Health estimates that it has approximately     2,700 stockholders, based on information provided by the     Company s stock transfer agent from their search of     individual participants in security position listings.         (c) Streamline Health has not paid any cash dividends on     its Common Stock since its inception and does not intend to pay     any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.        20    Table of Contents     MARKET     PRICE OF AND DIVIDENDS ON THE REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY     AND RELATED STOCK MATERS         The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return     on Common Stock with the cumulative total return on the NASDAQ     US Total Return Index and on the NASDAQ Computer and Data     Processing Services Stock Index for the period commencing     January 31, 2002 and ending January 31, 2007, assuming     an investment of $100 and the reinvestment of any dividends.

See also PART 1, ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS for a general     description of factors that affect Streamline Health s     business.     Application     of Critical Accounting Policies (See also Notes to Consolidated     Financial Statements)         Streamline Health s discussion and analysis of its     financial condition and results of operations are based upon its     consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in     accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the     United States. The preparation of these financial statements     requires Streamline Health to make estimates and judgments that     affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,     and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities.     On an on-going basis, Streamline Health evaluates its estimates,     including those related to product revenues, bad debts,     capitalized software development costs, income taxes, warranty     obligations, support contracts, contingencies and litigation.     Streamline Health bases its estimates on historical experience     and on various other assumptions that Streamline Health believes     are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which     form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of     assets and liabilities and revenue recognition. Actual results     may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or     conditions.         Streamline Health believes the following critical accounting     policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates     used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.     Revenue     Recognition         Streamline Health records revenues for customer contracts,     including special payment agreements and royalties from     third-party resellers in accordance with Statement of Position     97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. Revenue is derived from:     (i) the licensing and sale of systems, either directly to     end-users or through third-party resellers, comprising     internally developed software, third-party software and hardware     components; (ii) product support, maintenance and     professional services; and, (iii) application-hosting     services that provide high quality, transaction or subscriptions     based document imaging/management/workflow services from a     central data center. Generally, revenues from software license     fees and hardware sales to end-users are recognized when a     master agreement is signed and products are made available to     end-users. Revenues from agreements that contain     multiple-element arrangements are allocated to the various     elements based on the fair value of the elements. Revenues     related to routine installation and integration and project     management are deferred until the work is performed. Revenues     from consulting, education, and application-hosting services are     recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from     short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized     ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings to customers     recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as     deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to progress     billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables.         Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with IDX (now part of     GE Healthcare), Streamline Health records this revenue when the     products are made available to end-users. Royalties are remitted     to Streamline Health based upon IDX sublicensing Streamline     Health s software to its customers. Thirty percent of the     royalty is due 45 days following the end of the month in     which IDX executes an end-user license agreement with its     customer. The remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due,     in varying amounts based on specific milestones, 45 days     following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs.         Each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate     Streamline Health Client Manager to determine the     appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to     the individual contracts based upon the most currently available     information as to the status of the contract, the customer     comments, if any, and the status of any open or unresolved     issues with the customer.     Bad     Debts         Accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed     Streamline Health for licensed software, professional services,     including maintenance services and application-hosting     activities. Contracts with individual customers and resellers     determine when receivables are due and payable. In determining     the allowance for doubtful        23    Table of Contents       accounts, each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the     appropriate Streamline Health Client Manager to determine the     payment status based upon the most currently available     information as to the status of the receivables, the customer     comments, if any, and the status of any open or unresolved     issues with the customer preventing the payment thereof.     Corrective action, if necessary, is taken by Streamline Health     to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables. During     these quarterly reviews, Streamline Health determines the     required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses     resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers     or resellers to make required payments. If the financial     condition of Streamline Health s customers or resellers     were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability     to make payments, additional allowances may be required.     Streamline Health s customers typically have been     well-established hospitals, medical facilities, or major     Healthcare Information Systems companies that resell Streamline     Health s products, which have good credit histories, and     payments have been received within normal time frames for the     industry. However, some healthcare facilities have experienced     significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a     result of limits on third-party reimbursements from insurance     companies and governmental entities. Extended payment of     Streamline Health receivables is not uncommon.     Capitalized     Software Development Costs         Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,     Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or     Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and     designing phase of software development, including coding and     testing activities necessary to establish technological     feasibility are classified as product research and development     and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has     been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development,     including coding, testing, and product quality assurance, are     capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of     unamortized cost or net realizable value. Streamline Health     capitalized approximately $2,130,000, $1,450,000, and $1,000,000     in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.         Research and development expense, net of capitalized software     development expenditures, was $2,716,163, $2,733,293, and     $2,061,207 in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.         Amortization is provided on a     product-by-product     basis over the estimated economic life of the software, not to     exceed three years, using the straight-line method. Amortization     commences when a product is available for general release to     customers. Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in     excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at     the date of such determination. Amortization expense was     approximately $1,083,000, $800,000, and $633,000 in 2006, 2005,     and 2004, respectively.         Streamline Health reviews, on an on-going basis, the carrying     value of its capitalized software development expenditures, net     of accumulated amortization. Streamline Health believes that to     replicate the existing software would cost significantly more     than the stated net book value of $3,753,361 at January 31,     2007. Over the last three years, Streamline Health has spent     approximately $12,090,000 in research and development, of which     $4,580,000, or 38%, has been capitalized. Amortization of     capitalized software expenditures during the last three years     has amounted to approximately $2,516,000 or a net increase in     capitalized software of approximately $2,064,000 during the last     three years. Many of the programs related to capitalized     software development continue to have great value to Streamline     Health s current products and those under development, as     the concepts, ideas, and software code are readily transferable     and are incorporated into new products.     Equity     Awards   Stock-Based Compensation         The Company was required to adopt the revised standards of     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),     Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which requires     the expensing the fair value of the equity award effective the     first quarter of fiscal year 2006. The Company has determined     that the impact on future earnings for existing outstanding     equity awards is not material. However, future grants of equity     awards could have a material impact on reported expenses     depending upon the number, value and vesting period of future     awards.        24    Table of Contents     Income     Taxes         In June, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued     Interpretation No, 48, Accounting for Uncertainties in Income     Taxes (FIN 48), an interpretation of Financial     Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 109, Accounting     for Income Taxes, to create a single model to address     accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. FIN 48     clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a     minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet     before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48     also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement,     classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim     periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for     fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company     will adopt FIN 48 as of February 1, 2007, as required.     The cumulative effect, if any, of adopting FIN 48 will be     recorded in retained earnings and or other accounts as     applicable. The Company has not determined the effect, if any,     the adoption of FIN 48 will have on the Company s     financial position and results of operations.         The net income tax expense was $31,180 in 2006 and the tax     benefit was $867,361, and $455,753, in 2005 and 2004,     respectively. The net current deferred tax asset was $625,000     and the non-current deferred tax asset was $1,250,000 at     January 31, 2007 and the net current deferred tax asset was     $601,000 and the non current deferred tax asset was $1,274,000     at January 31, 2006. A key assumption in the determination     of the book tax benefit or (provision) is the amount of the     valuation allowance required to reduce the related deferred tax     assets. A valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to     a level which will, more likely than not, be realized. Whether     the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the     generation of future taxable income during the periods in which     the deferred tax asset become deductible. The net deferred tax     assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which     will, more likely than not, reduce future taxable income.         As of January 31, 2007, Streamline Health believes that a     valuation allowance is required to reduce a portion of the     deferred tax assets, primarily relating to certain net operating     loss carry forwards, for the following reasons:         Although Streamline Health generated approximately $1,913,000 of     earnings before income taxes during the three-year period ended     January 31, 2007, there can be no assurance that Streamline     Health will be able to achieve consistent profitability on a     quarterly or annual basis or be able to sustain or increase its     revenue growth in future periods and believes historical     operating results may not be indicative of the future     performance of Streamline Health in the near or long-term.     Streamline Health has incurred net losses as indicated by the     carry forwards of approximately $28,000,000.         Based on the expenses associated with current and planned     staffing levels, continued profitability and utilization of     carry forwards to be evaluated as  more likely than     not  is dependent upon increasing revenues.         As of January 31, 2007, Streamline Health estimates that a     valuation allowance of approximately $8,309,000 was required to     reduce the deferred tax assets, primarily relating to loss carry     forwards, to a level Streamline Health currently believes     will be utilized to offset future earnings before income taxes     based on the current backlog and forecasts over the next two     years. The valuation allowance is required due to the inability     to predict on a longer term basis that Streamline Health will      more likely than not  attain levels of profitability     required to utilize additional carry forwards.

The     amount of the computer equipment        25    Table of Contents       leased assets is $267,237. The lease is payable monthly in     installments of $8,192, through August 2008. The present value     of the future lease payments upon lease inception was $267,237     using the interest rates implicit in the lease agreement at the     inception of the lease.     Long-term     Debt         In January 2007, Streamline Health entered into a three year     working capital revolving loan agreement, with an option for two     one year extensions. The loan is secured by all of the assets of     Streamline Health and the loan agreement restricts Streamline     Health from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed     money, including capitalized leases, etc. without lender     consent. The Company is required to meet certain financial     covenants, including minimum level of tangible net worth, fixed     charge coverage ratio, working capital ratio and funded     indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation     and amortization. These covenants may limit the borrowing under     this credit agreement.         Streamline Health complied with all of the provisions of its     loan agreements during the year.         In connection with the issuance of the long-term debt in 1998,     Streamline Health issued Warrants to purchase     750,000 shares of Common Stock of Streamline Health at     $3.87 per share at any time through July 16, 2008. The     Warrants are subject to customary antidilution and registration     rights provisions.     Operating     Leases         Streamline Health rents office, data center space and equipment     under noncancelable operating leases that expire, at various     times, during the next five fiscal years. The minimum payments,     by year, are detailed in the Contractual Obligations table above.     Warranties     and Indemnities         Streamline Health provides for the estimated cost of the product     warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Should products     fail to meet certain performance standards for an initial     warranty period, Streamline Health s estimated warranty     liability might need to be increased. Streamline Health bases     its warranty estimates on the nature of any performance     complaint, the effort necessary to resolve the issue, customer     requirements and any potential concessions which may be required     to be granted to a customer which result from performance     issues. Streamline Health s ASPeN     application-hosting services guarantees specific      up-time  and  response time  performance     standards, which, if not met may result in reduced revenues, as     a penalty, for the month in which the standards are not met.     Streamline Health s standard agreements with its customers     also usually include intellectual property infringement     indemnifications provisions to indemnify them from and against     third-party claims, and for liabilities, damages, and expenses     arising out of Streamline Health s operation of its     business or any negligent act or omission of Streamline Health.     To date Streamline Health has always maintained the     ASPeN performance standards and has not been     required to make any material penalty payments to customers or     indemnify any customers for any material third-party claims. At     January 31, 2007 and 2006, Streamline Health has a warranty     reserve in the amount of $250,000. Each contract is reviewed     quarterly with the appropriate Streamline Health Client Manager     to determine the need for a warranty reserve based upon the most     currently available information as to the status of the     contract, the customer comments, if any, and the status of any     open or unresolved issues with the customer.     Off     Balance Sheet Arrangements         Streamline Health does not have any off balance sheet     arrangements.        26    Table of Contents     Results     of Operations         The following table sets forth, for each fiscal year indicated,     certain operating data as percentages:     Consolidated     Statements of Income(1)                                                         Fiscal Year(2)                 2006           2005           2004               Systems sales                     27.0       %               37.9       %               23.2       %      Services, maintenance and support                     52.4                   43.1                   56.4          Application-hosting services                     20.6                   19.0                   20.4                                                                Total revenues                     100.0                   100.0                   100.0          Cost of sales                     45.2                   39.9                   47.5          Selling, general and administrative                     36.6                   32.4                   29.0          Product research and development                     17.1                   16.9                   16.2                                                                Total operating expenses                     98.9                   89.2                   92.7                                                                Operating profit(3)                     1.1                   10.8                   7.3          Other income (expense), net                     (.5       )               (0.3       )               (6.5       )      Income tax net benefit(4)                                         5.3                   3.6                                                                Net earnings(3 & 4)                     0.6       %               15.8       %               4.4       %                                                            Cost of systems sales                     56.7       %               36.9       %               78.6       %                                                            Cost of services, maintenance and     support                     43.4       %               45.0       %               39.0       %                                                            Cost of application-hosting     services                     34.5       %               34.3       %               35.3       %                                                                             (1)        Because a significant percentage of the operating costs are     expensed as incurred, a variation in the timing of systems sales     and installations and the resulting revenue recognition can     cause significant variations in operating results. As a result,     period-to-period     comparisons may not be meaningful with respect to the past     operations nor are they necessarily indicative of the future     operations of Streamline Health in the near or long-term. The     data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of     reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to     revenues for the periods indicated.          (2)        All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year     commencing on February 1 of that calendar year and ending on     January 31 of the following year.          (3)        Operating profit and net earnings in 2004 include a $300,000     reduction in reserves due to a change in estimates and in 2006,     a $100,000 reduction in reserves due to changes in estimates.          (4)        Net earnings in 2005 and 2004 include a tax benefit of $897,000     and $420,000, respectively, relating to the reduction in the     valuation allowances for the deferred tax assets relating to the     net operating loss carry forward based upon reasonable future     earnings before income tax projections.      Comparison     of fiscal year 2006 with 2005     Revenues.  Total revenues for fiscal year 2006     were $15,866,973 compared with revenues of $16,126,808 in fiscal     year 2005, a decrease of approximately $260,000, or 2%. The     decrease was primarily due to an approximately 47% or $2,100,000     decrease in software licensing revenues, offset by an     approximately $1,840,000, increase in all other revenue     categories other than software. Because software revenues     generate the highest margins this lower revenues resulted in     significantly reduced operating profits for the fiscal year when     compared to the prior year.         Revenues from systems sales in fiscal year 2006 were $4,278,792,     a decrease of $1,833,935, or 30% of systems sales in fiscal year     2005 primarily resulting from the significant decrease in     software licensing revenues as discussed above.        27    Table of Contents         Revenues from services, maintenance, and support in fiscal year     2006 were $8,314,979, an increase of $1,364,797, or 20% over     fiscal year 2005. Professional services revenues in fiscal year     2006 were $2,697,927, an increase of $852,505, of the     professional services revenues in fiscal year 2005. Maintenance     and support revenues in fiscal year 2006 were $5,617,052, an     increase of $512,292, or 10%, over maintenance and support     revenues in fiscal year 2005. The increase in professional     services revenues was due to increased customer installations.     The increase in maintenance and support results from the     addition of new customers who pay annual maintenance.         Revenues from application-hosting services were $3,273,202 or an     increase of $209,303, or 7% over fiscal year 2005. The increase     was due primarily to increased revenues from existing customers.     Application-hosting services revenues at some locations are     usage based and fluctuations in admissions, length of stay,     return patient visits, etc. affect the system usage and the     corresponding application-hosting services revenues.         In fiscal year 2006, three customers accounted for 26% of the     total revenues compared with 38% in fiscal year 2005, exclusive     of our remarketing partners. Total revenues from Siemens were     $420,921 in fiscal year 2006 compared with $382,594 in fiscal     year 2005. No additional revenues are anticipated from Siemens     in the future. Total revenues from IDX were $4,395,189 in fiscal     year 2006, ($1,003,000 was hardware sales, $919,000 was software     and $1,421,415 in maintenance and support revenues) compared     with $1,988,412 in fiscal 2005. The increase in IDX revenues     included increased software revenues, significantly increased     hardware and third party software sales and increased     professional services and maintenance revenues. A substantial     portion of fiscal year total 2006 revenues came from fulfillment     of backlog and add-on business, primarily expansion and upgrades     of systems for Streamline Health s existing customers.     Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales consists of cost     of systems sales, cost of services, maintenance and support, and     cost of application-hosting services. Cost of systems sales     includes amortization of capitalized software expenditures,     royalties, and the cost of third-party hardware and software.     Cost of systems sales, as a percentage of systems sales, varies     from     period-to-period     depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems     sold. The cost of systems sales as a percentage of associated     revenues in fiscal year 2006 and 2005 were 57% and 37%,     respectively. The higher costs in 2006 reflect a significantly     lower volume of Streamline Health software, with high margins     and a significantly higher volume of hardware and third party     software with significantly lower margins, when compared with     2005 when a greater portion of system sales included more     software and less hardware and third party software. Cost of     services, maintenance, and support includes salaries and     benefits for support and professional services personnel and the     cost of third-party maintenance contracts. Cost of services,     maintenance and support as a percentage of services, maintenance     and support revenues in 2006 and 2005 were 43% and 45%,     respectively. The lower relative cost reflects increased     professional services revenues without a corresponding increase     in expenses. The cost of application-hosting services in 2006     and 2005 as a percentage of revenues was 34% and 34%,     respectively, and represents primarily salaries and benefits,     depreciation and the cost of the collocation high security     application hosting data center.     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling,     general and administrative expenses consist primarily of     personnel and related costs, travel and living expenses,     tradeshows, etc. for selling and marketing activities and     general corporate and administrative activities. In fiscal year     2006, selling, general, and administrative expenses were     $5,802,656 compared with $5,218,303 in fiscal year 2005. The     year-to-year     increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and     marketing staff as the Company expanded its staff to respond to     increasing inquiries and sales opportunities, additional     expenses for tradeshows, marketing collateral and market costs     associated with the re-branding of the Company as      Streamline Health  to strengthen the focus on new     market opportunities involving business process improvement via     workflow automation technologies.     Product Research and Development.  Product     research and development expenses in fiscal year 2006 were     $2,716,163 compared with $2,733.293 in fiscal year 2005. During     2006, Streamline Health increased its technical staff and added     additional contractors to concentrate its development efforts     primarily on its new products and new workflow technologies.     Streamline Health capitalized approximately $2,130,000 in     software development expenditures in fiscal year 2006, compared     with $1,450,000 in 2005. The increase in capitalized software in     2006, reflects the increased 2006 development activities related     to new products or enhancements to existing products.        28    Table of Contents   Operating Profit.  Operating profit in fiscal     year 2006 was $181,590 compared with $1,738,322 in fiscal year     2005. The $1,556,732, or 90% decrease, results primarily from an     approximately $1,834,000 decrease in high margin software     licensing revenues discussed above and increased expenses during     the fiscal year.     Other Income (Expense).  Interest income     consists primarily of interest on cash balances. The interest     income declined during 2006 because of lower cash balances.     Interest expense in 2006 was related to the then current term     loan and capitalized leases. The decrease in the interest     expense in 2006 results primarily from the reduction of the     outstanding debt during the year.     Provision for Income Taxes.  Streamline Health     is in a tax loss carry forward position. The tax loss carry     forward approximates $28,000,000, which begins to expire in     2013. Streamline Health also has an Alternative Minimum Tax     credit carry forward of approximately $74,000, which has an     unlimited carry forward period. The income tax provision in     fiscal years 2005 and 2003 includes the Alternative Minimum Tax     paid by the Company, as all income could not be offset against     the Alternative Minimum Tax loss carry forward. In fiscal year     2005, and 2004 Streamline Health recorded a tax benefit in the     amount of $897,000, and $420,000, respectively, as a result of a     reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets     relating primarily to the tax loss carry forward based on future     earnings before income tax projections.     Net Earnings.  Net earnings in fiscal year 2006     were $96,461 compared with net earnings of $2,551,072 in fiscal     year 2005. The decrease results primarily from decreased     software revenues and higher operating expenses.         The decrease in cash resulted primarily from the reduction in     long-term debt during the year.         The decrease in accounts and contract receivables, both current     and non-current is due to significantly lower software licensing     revenues during the fourth quarter of 2006 compared with the     fourth quarter of 2005.         The decrease in property and equipment, net is due to the     disposal of obsolete equipment in 2006. The disposal had no     impact on operations as it was all fully depreciated as the time     of disposal.         The decrease in accounts payable is due to a large sale of third     party hardware and software in the last few days of the prior     fiscal year, which were not paid for until the first quarter     fiscal 2006. There was no similar increase in 2006 accounts     payable because there was no similar large hardware sale in the     fourth quarter of 2007.         The decrease in accrued compensation in 2006 is due to lower     accrued commissions on significantly decreased fourth quarter     revenues and decreased accrued bonuses as a result of the     Company not meeting its fourth quarter Operating Profit     threshold for the payment of bonuses when compared with 2005.     Comparison     of fiscal year 2005 with 2004     Revenues.  Total revenues for fiscal year 2005     were $16,126,808 compared with revenues of $12,750,658 in fiscal     year 2004, an increase of approximately $3,376,000, or 26%. The     increase was primarily due to approximately a 391% or $3,587,000     increase in software licensing revenues, and approximately     $465,000, or 18% in application hosting revenues, substantially     all of which was due to expansion of our systems at existing     customers, offset by a decrease of approximately $439,000 in     hardware and third party software revenues, and $236,000 in     services, maintenance, support and other revenues.         Revenues from systems sales in fiscal year 2005 were $6,112,727,     an increase of $3,147,465, or 106% of systems sales in fiscal     year 2004 primarily resulting from the significant increase in     software licensing revenues as discussed above.         Revenues from services, maintenance, and support in fiscal year     2005 were $6,950,182, a decrease of $236,122 over fiscal year     2004. Professional services revenues in fiscal year 2005 were     $1,845,422, a decrease of $121,320, of the professional services     revenues in fiscal year 2004. Maintenance and support revenues     in fiscal year 2005 were $5,104,760, a decrease of $114,802,     over maintenance and support revenues in fiscal year 2004. The     decrease in professional services revenues was due to some     delays in customer installations. The decrease in maintenance     and support results from some discontinuation of support on some     items by some customers.         Revenues from application-hosting services were $3,063,899 an     increase of $464,807, or 18% over fiscal year 2004. The increase     was due to increased revenues from existing customers.     Application-hosting services revenues        29    Table of Contents       at some locations were usage based and fluctuations in     admissions, length of stay, return patient visits, etc. affect     the system usage and the corresponding application-hosting     services revenues.         In fiscal year 2005, three customers accounted for 38% of the     total revenues compared with 34% in fiscal year 2004, exclusive     of our remarketing partners. Total revenues from Siemens were     $382,594 in fiscal year 2005 compared with $451,255 in fiscal     year 2004 and through IDX, $1,988,412 in fiscal year 2005     compared with $2,760,900 in fiscal 2004. A substantial portion     of fiscal year 2005 revenues came from fulfillment of backlog     and add-on business, primarily expansion and upgrades of systems     for Streamline Health s existing customers, and 15% came     from resellers, compared with 25% in fiscal year 2004. The     decrease in the percentage of revenues from resellers reflect     the declining maintenance revenues from Siemens customers and     less than expected new system revenues from IDX in 2005.     Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales consists of cost     of systems sales, cost of services, maintenance and support, and     cost of application-hosting services. Cost of systems sales     includes amortization of capitalized software expenditures,     royalties, and the cost of third-party hardware and software.     Cost of systems sales, as a percentage of systems sales, varies     from     period-to-period     depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems     sold. The cost of systems sales as a percentage of associated     revenues in fiscal year 2005 and 2004 were 37% and 79%,     respectively. The lower costs in 2005 reflect a significantly     higher volume of Streamline Health software, with high margins     when compared with 2004 when a greater portion of system sales     included more hardware and third party software. Cost of     services, maintenance, and support includes salaries and     benefits for support and professional services personnel and the     cost of third-party maintenance contracts. Cost of services,     maintenance and support as a percentage of services, maintenance     and support revenues in 2005 and 2004 were 45% and 39%,     respectively. The higher relative cost reflects increased     staffing necessary in providing the services. The cost of     application-hosting services in 2005 and 2004 as a percentage of     revenues was 34% and 35%, respectively, and represents primarily     salaries and benefits, depreciation and the cost of the     collocation high security application hosting data center. The     decline in the relative cost percentage reflects higher revenues     without a corresponding increase in costs as the operating costs     are relatively fixed and additional clients do not require a     corresponding large increase in operating costs.     Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling,     general and administrative expenses consist primarily of     personnel and related costs, travel and living expenses,     tradeshows, etc. for selling and marketing activities and     general corporate and administrative activities. In fiscal year     2005, selling, general, and administrative expenses were     $5,218,303 compared with $3,701,443 in fiscal year 2004. The     year-to-year     increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and     marketing staff as the Company expanded its staff to respond to     increasing inquiries and sales opportunities, additional     expenses for tradeshows, marketing collateral and market costs     associated with the re-branding of the Company as      Streamline Health  to strengthen the focus on new     market opportunities involving business process improvement via     workflow automation technologies, and increased sales     commissions and bonus expenses, resulting from increased     revenues and operating profits.     Product Research and Development.  Product     research and development expenses in fiscal year 2005 were     $2,733,293 compared with $2,061,207 in fiscal year 2004. During     2005, Streamline Health increased its technical staff and added     additional contractors to concentrate its development efforts     primarily on its new products and new workflow technologies.     Streamline Health capitalized approximately $1,450,000 in     software development expenditures in fiscal year 2005, compared     with $1,000,000 in 2004.     Operating Profit.  Operating profit in fiscal     year 2005 was $1,738,322 compared with $935,893 in fiscal year     2004. The $802,429, or 85% increase, results primarily from an     approximately $3,587,000 increase in high margin software     licensing revenues discussed above notwithstanding the     significant increases in operating expenses.     Other Income (Expense).  Interest income     consists primarily of interest on cash balances. Interest     expense in 2005 is related to the current term loan and     capitalized leases. The 2004 interest expense includes     approximately $784,000 in interest on the unpaid balance of the     1998 long-term debt, and additional interest on the unpaid     long-term accrued interest payable relating to the 1998     long-term debt. The decrease in the interest expense in 2005     results primarily from the repayment of the 1998 high interest     rate long-term debt and the accrued and unpaid accrued interest     relating thereto in July 2004 and replacing it with     significantly lower cost debt.        30    Table of Contents   Provision for Income Taxes.  Streamline Health     is in a tax loss carry forward position. The income tax     provision in fiscal years 2005 includes the Alternative Minimum     Tax paid by the Company, as all income could not be offset     against the Alternative Minimum Tax loss carry forward. In     fiscal year 2005 and 2004, Streamline Health recorded a tax     benefit in the amount of $897,000, and $420,000, respectively,     as a result of a reduction in the valuation allowance on the     deferred tax assets relating primarily to the tax loss carry     forward based on future earnings before income tax projections.     Net Earnings.  Net earnings in fiscal year 2005     were $2,551,072 compared with net earnings of $557,676 in fiscal     year 2004. The increase results primarily from increased     software revenues and partially offset by higher operating     expenses, combined with lower interest expense for fiscal year     2005 as a result of the repayment of the high interest rate debt     in July 2004 and the increased tax benefit, as a result of the     adjustment of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance.         The increase in accounts and contract receivables, both current     and non-current is due to the significant licensing revenues     recorded in January 2006. The payment terms also include     deferred payments due in fiscal 2007.         The increase in property and equipment, net is due to the     relocation and expansion of the office facilities to accommodate     the increased staff, and additional computer equipment for the     Application-hosting data center in fiscal 2005.         The increase in accounts payable is due to the sale of third     party hardware and software in January 2006, which was not paid     for until fiscal 2006.         The increase in accrued compensation is due to an increase in     accrued commissions on significantly increased fourth quarter     revenues and increased accrued bonuses as a result of the     Company meeting its annual Operating Profit threshold for the     payment of bonuses in fiscal 2005. The Company paid no such     Operating Profit bonuses in fiscal 2004 as the Operating Profit     threshold was not met.     Backlog         At January 31, 2007 Streamline Health has master agreements     and purchase orders from customers and remarketing partners for     systems and related services (excluding support and maintenance,     and transaction-based application-hosting revenues), which have     not been delivered or installed which, if fully performed, would     generate future revenues of approximately $5,226,000 compared     with $4,159,000 at January 31, 2006. The related products     and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to     three years. The increase in the backlog is the result of     signing new agreements with new and existing customers late in     the fourth quarter of 2005 and early 2006 which have not been     fully implemented. In addition, customers contract for     maintenance and support services on a monthly, quarterly, or     annual basis. At January 31, 2007, Streamline Health had     maintenance agreements, purchase orders, from remarketing     partners for maintenance, which if fully performed, will     generate future revenues of approximately $4,469,000, compared     with $3,533,000 at January 31, 2006, through their     respective renewal dates in fiscal year 2007 and 2008. The     increase results from the addition of new customers or expansion     of systems with existing customers. In 2006, maintenance and     support revenues approximated $5,617,000 compared with     $5,104,000 in 2005 and are expected to increase in fiscal year     2007. At January 31, 2007, Streamline Health has entered     into application-hosting agreements, which are expected to     generate revenues in excess of $5,256,000 through their     respective renewal dates in fiscal years 2007 through 2012. The     application-hosting backlog is higher than the $4,784,000 in     2005 as the multi year agreements were renewed and new clients     added.         Revenues from the IDX/GE Healthcare Remarketing Agreement for     the last three years amounted to approximately $9,145,000, or     20% of the total revenues for the last three fiscal years.     Streamline Health relies on IDX/GE Healthcare for a significant     amount of its revenues, the loss of which would have a material     adverse affect on future results of operations.         Streamline Health believes a greater percentage of its future     revenues will come from remarketing agreements with, IDX/GE     Healthcare, and other HIS related vendors. Streamline Health     continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other     companies.        31    Table of Contents         Streamline Health believes the large HIS vendors, hospitals and     integrated healthcare delivery networks now have a better     understanding of the valuable role the document management and     workflow technologies play in providing truly computerized     information and the benefits of such systems in utilizing     advanced workflow solutions. As more healthcare providers become     aware of and better understand the significant economic and     operating benefits of utilizing document management and workflow     applications, Streamline Health believes the future demand for     its products and services will increase.         Many companies have emerged to provide healthcare applications     through private Intranets or secure applications on the     Internet. Additionally, the traditional HIS companies have     developed clinical information systems for the Internet.     Streamline Health s applications are well suited for     integration with such clinical systems and are optimized for use     on the Internet and private Intranets. Through Streamline     Health s ASPeN Services, application-hosting     customers can rapidly deploy and access healthcare information     using web browser-based technology from a central data center on     a per transaction or subscription basis thereby minimizing     up-front capital expenditures. Streamline Health believes     healthcare organizations will continue to increase their use of     healthcare applications through the Internet, and Streamline     Health s products are an integral part of providing a     complete EMR across the Internet. Streamline Health continues to     actively pursue strategic relationships with other healthcare     Application Service Providers.         Management believes that revenue growth can be fueled by: the     expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts, an increase     in incremental revenue from existing and new strategic     distribution partners, an increase in interest by healthcare     organizations in Streamline Health products and services to     assist in compliance with the Federal HIPAA standards as they     relate to the confidentiality and security of medical records,     and incremental new revenues derived from new lines of business     for Streamline Health in the remote coding, revenue cycle and     other workflows for the hospital marketplace. The revenue cycle     workflows are a logical extension of the product line because of     the ability of the Financial Services departments of hospitals     to access and process patient information from the EMR. Due to     an acute shortage of available coding personnel, there currently     exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain     qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient.         Since commencing operations in 1989, Streamline Health has     incurred substantial cumulative operating losses. Although     Streamline Health achieved operating profitability during the     last seven years, Streamline Health incurred net losses in most     fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2000. Based upon the expenses     associated with current and planned staffing levels, continued     profitability is dependent upon increasing revenues. Although     the Company believes that it can continue to be profitable,     there can be no assurance that Streamline Health will be able to     neither achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or     annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue     growth in future periods and believes historical operating     results may not be indicative of the future performance of     Streamline Health in the near or long-term.     Liquidity     and Capital Resources         During the last five fiscal years, Streamline Health has funded     its operations, working capital needs, and capital expenditures     primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations, a     $3,500,000 bank loan in 2004 and the current revolving credit     facility. Streamline Health s liquidity is dependent upon     numerous factors including: (i) the timing and amount of     revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers,     (ii) amounts invested in research and development, capital     expenditures, and (iii) the level of operating expenses,     all of which can vary significantly from     quarter-to-quarter.         Streamline Health s customers typically have been     well-established hospitals or medical facilities or major HIS     companies that resell Streamline Health  products, which     have good credit histories and payments have been received     within normal time frames for the industry. However, some     healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating     losses as a result of limits on third-party reimbursements from     insurance companies and governmental entities. Agreements with     customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms     typically require customers to make progress payments.         Streamline Health has no significant obligations for capital     resources, other than its $1,000,000 of revolving debt, the     noncancelable operating leases of approximately $1,287,000     payable over the next four years and        32    Table of Contents       capitalized leases of approximately $156,000, payable over the     next two years. Capital expenditures for property and equipment     in 2007 are not expected to exceed $500,000.         During the last three years, Streamline Health has expended     approximately $1,853,000 for capital expenditures, increased its     sales and marketing expenses, product research and development     and support and consulting expenses, and made net debt and     deferred interest repayments of approximately $7,625,000. This     resulted in significant net cash outlays over the last four     years. Although Streamline Health reduced staffing levels and     related expenses during 2003 and 2004, the stringent expense     controls and reduced staffing, caused by the necessity to retire     the long-term debt, hampered the growth of revenues in fiscal     year 2003 and 2004. Accordingly, to continue to achieve     increasing revenues and profitability it was necessary for the     Company to significantly increase the sales and marketing     expenses in fiscal 2005 and 2006. The Company believes that this     strategic initiative to expand sales and marketing should     produce improved results in 2007 and beyond as the expanded     sales and marketing efforts begin to produce results. However,     there can be no assurance Streamline Health will be able to do     so.         At January 31, 2007, Streamline Health had cash of     $3,316,614, of which $1,000,000 was used in February 2007 to     repay the then outstanding balance of the revolving loan.         Streamline Health has carefully monitored operating expenses     during the last five fiscal years. Notwithstanding the current     levels of revenues and operating profit, for the foreseeable     future, Streamline Health will need to continually assess its     revenue prospects compared to its then current expenditure     levels. If it does not appear likely that revenues will     increase, it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or     raise cash through additional borrowings, the sale of assets, or     other equity financing. Certain of these actions will require     current lender approval. However, there can be no assurance     Streamline Health will be successful in any of these efforts. If     it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses, this     could have an adverse effect on future operating performance.         Streamline Health believes that its present cash position,     combined with cash generation currently anticipated from     operations and the availability of the revolving credit facility     will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the     short term. However, continued expansion of the Company will     require additional resources. The Company may need to refinance     its current debt, obtain an additional infusion of capital, or a     combination of both, depending on the extent of the expansion of     the Company and future revenues. However, there can be no     assurance Streamline Health will be able to do so.         To date, inflation has not had a material impact on Streamline     Health s revenues or expenses.         Net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 exceeded     $2,500,000, down from approximately $2,770,000 in the prior     fiscal year. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for     the individual components comprising the net cash provided by     operating activities.           Item 7A.     Quantitative     and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk           Streamline Health currently invests its cash balances, in excess     of its current needs in an interest bearing account. Streamline     Health does not invest for the purposes of trading in     securities. Additionally, Streamline Health does not have any     significant market risk exposure at January 31, 2007.        33                Item 8.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of     Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. as of January 31, 2007     and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,     changes in stockholders  equity, and cash flows for each of     the three years in the period ended January 31, 2007. Our     audits also included the financial statement schedule of     Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. listed in item 15(a).     These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility     of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to     express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule     based on our audits.         We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the     Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those     standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain     reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are     free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an     audit of the Company s internal control over financial     reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control     over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit     procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not     for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of     the Company s internal control over financial reporting.     Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes     examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and     disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the     accounting principles used and significant estimates made by     management, and evaluating the overall financial statement     presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable     basis for our opinion.         In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above     present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated     financial position of Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. at     January 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of     its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in     the period ended January 31, 2007, in conformity with     U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our     opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when     considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken     as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the     information set forth herein.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            1.     Organization     and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies           Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. (Streamline Health or the     Company) operates in one segment as a provider of Healthcare     Information Workflow Technology through the licensing of its     Electronic Health Information Management, Patient Financial     Services and other Workflow software applications and the use of     such applications through its application-hosting services as an     Application Service Provider. Streamline Health s products     enable hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery systems in     the United States to capture, store, manage, route, retrieve,     and process vast amounts of patient clinical, financial and     other healthcare provider information.     Fiscal     Year         All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year     commencing February 1 in that calendar year and ending on     January 31 of the following year.     Consolidation         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of     Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiary, Streamline     Health, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions are     eliminated.     Use of     Estimates         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States     requires management to make estimates and assumptions that     affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and     accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those     estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006, Streamline     Health recorded a $100,000 favorable change in the estimate for     miscellaneous reserves. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year     2004, Streamline Health recorded a $300,000 favorable change in     the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts and     miscellaneous reserves. In fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the     Company made certain estimates of its future earnings before     income taxes in determining the amount of the valuation     allowance required for the deferred income tax assets relating     to the net operating loss carry forward (See Note 4).     Revenue     Recognition         Revenue is derived from: the licensing and sale of systems,     either directly to end-users or through third-party resellers,     comprising internally developed software, third-party software     and hardware components; product support, maintenance and     professional services; and application-hosting services that     provide high quality, transaction or subscription based document     imaging/management services from a central data center.     Streamline Health s revenue recognition policies conform to     Statement of Position     97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.  Generally,     revenue from software license fees and hardware sales to     end-users is recognized when a master agreement is signed and     products are made available to end-users. Revenues from     agreements that contain multiple-element arrangements are     allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the     specific elements. Revenues related to routine installation and     integration and project management are deferred until the work     is performed. Streamline Health follows this method since     reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs     applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Revenues     from consulting, education, and application-hosting services are     recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from     short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized     ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings to customers     recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as     deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to progress     billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables.     Cash         Cash includes demand deposits.        40    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)    Receivables         Accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed     Streamline Health for licensed software, professional services,     including maintenance services and application-hosting     activities and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of     $200,000 at January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006,     respectively. Contracts with individual customers and resellers     determine when receivables are due. In determining the allowance     for doubtful accounts, each unpaid receivable is reviewed     quarterly with the appropriate Streamline Health Client Manager     to determine the payment status based upon the most currently     available information as to the status of the receivables, the     customer comments, if any, and the status of any open or     unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment     thereof. Corrective action, if necessary, is taken by Streamline     Health to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables.     During these quarterly reviews, Streamline Health determines the     required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses     resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers     or resellers to make required payments.     Concentrations         Financial instruments, which potentially expose Streamline     Health to concentrations of credit risk, as defined by Statement     of Financial Accounting Standards No. 105, Disclosure of     Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet     Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit     Risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable. Streamline     Health s accounts receivable are concentrated in the     healthcare industry. However, Streamline Health s customers     typically have been well-established hospitals, medical     facilities, or major Health Information Systems companies that     resell Streamline Health s products that have good credit     histories and payments have been received within normal time     frames for the industry. However, some hospitals and medical     facilities have experienced significant operating losses as a     result of limits on third-party reimbursements from insurance     companies and governmental entities and extended payment of     receivables from these entities is not uncommon.         To date, Streamline Health has relied on a limited number of     customers and remarketing partners for a substantial portion of     its total revenues. Streamline Health expects that a significant     portion of its future revenues will continue to be generated by     a limited number of customers and its remarketing partners. The     failure to obtain new customers or expand sales through     remarketing partners, the loss of existing customers or     reduction in revenues from existing customers could materially     and adversely affect Streamline Health s operating results     (See Note 6).         Streamline Health currently buys all of its hardware and some     major software components of its Healthcare Information Systems     from third-party vendors. Although there are a limited number of     vendors capable of supplying these components, management     believes that other suppliers could provide similar components     on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause     a delay in system implementations and a possible loss of     revenues, which could adversely affect operating results.     Other     Current Assets         Other current assets are primarily: prepaid insurance,     commissions, maintenance, deposits, deferred Federal income tax     assets and prepaid expenses related to future revenues (See     Note 4).     Property     and Equipment         Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is     computed using the straight-line depreciation, over the     estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful     lives are as follows:                          Computer equipment and software                     3-4 years          Office equipment                     5 years          Office furniture and fixtures                     7 years          Leasehold improvements                     Life of lease                41    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)        In 2005, Streamline Health entered into a sixty-six month     operating lease for office space. In connection with the lease,     the property owner provided certain lease inducements to the     Company, including a $326,000 build out allowance and use of the     premises for six months rent free. The Company has accounted for     the value of these inducements by recording the build out     allowance as a leasehold improvement with a corresponding lease     incentive liability. The total amount of the lease payments are     amortized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the term     of the lease. The leasehold improvement asset and the lease     incentive liability are each amortized on a straight line basis     over the term of the lease to depreciation and as an offset to     rent expense, respectively. Any timing differences between the     actual monthly lease payments and the straight line rent expense     is recorded as an adjustment to the lease incentive liability.         Depreciation expense for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $735,897,     $670,655, and $514,149, respectively.         Leased computer equipment and software meeting certain criteria     are capitalized and the present value of the related lease     payments is recorded as a liability. Depreciation of the     capitalized lease assets is computed on the straight-line method     over the term of the lease.         Normal repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred.     Replacements are capitalized and the property and equipment     accounts are relieved of the items being replaced or disposed     of, or if no longer of value. The related cost and accumulated     deprecation of the disposed assets are eliminated and any gain     or loss on disposition is included in the results of operations     in the year of disposal.     Capitalized     Software Development Costs         Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,     Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or     Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and     designing phase of software development, including coding and     testing activities necessary to establish technological     feasibility are classified as product research and development     and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has     been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development,     including coding, testing, and product quality assurance, are     capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of     unamortized cost or net realizable value. Streamline Health     capitalized approximately $2,130,000, $1,450,000, and $1,000,000     in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.         Research and development expense, net of capitalized amounts,     was $2,716,163, $2,733,293, and $2,061,207 in 2006, 2005 and     2004, respectively.         Amortization is provided on a     product-by-product     basis over the estimated economic life of the software, not to     exceed three years, using the straight-line method. Amortization     commences when a product is available for general release to     customers. Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in     excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at     the date of such determination. Amortization expense was     approximately $1,083,000, $800,000, and $633,000 in 2006, 2005,     and 2004, respectively.     Other     non-current assets         Other non-current assets at January 31, 2007 and 2006     consist primarily of deferred tax assets (See Note 4).     Accrued     Other Expenses         Accrued other expenses at January 31, 2007, and 2006     include warranty reserves, accrued franchise and property taxes,     professional fees and other similar liabilities.     Income     Taxes         The provisions for income taxes are accounted for in accordance     with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,     Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and     liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and     liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences     attributable to differences between the        42    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)        financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and     liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets     and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to     apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary     differences are expected to be recovered or settled.     Stock     Options and Stock Appreciation Rights         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,     Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a     fair value method of financial accounting and reporting for     stock-based compensation plans. Streamline Health elected to     continue to account for stock options under the intrinsic value     method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion     No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees     and, accordingly, adopted the disclosure only provisions of     Statement 123 through fiscal year 2005. No stock-based     compensation cost is reflected in the net earnings for fiscal     years 2005 and 2004, as all options granted under the plans had     exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying     common stock on the date of grant. The table below illustrates     the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if     Streamline Health had applied the fair value recognition     provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards     No. 123, to stock-based employee compensation.         The Company adopted the revised standards of Statement of     Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), Accounting     for Stock-Based Compensation, effective the first quarter of     fiscal year 2006, which requires expensing the fair value of the     equity awards. The Company elected to adopt the     Modified-Prospective Transition method. Under this method, the     Company is required to recognize compensation cost for     share-based payments based on their grant-date fair value from     the beginning of the fiscal period in which the recognition     provisions are first applied. As a result of adopting     Statement 123(R) on February 1, 2006, the Company     incurred total additional annual compensation expense of     $111,137 in the amount of $22,966, $30,062, $27,875 and $30,234     in the four fiscal quarters, respectively. The fair value of the     2006 stock-based compensation was estimated at the date of     grants using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the     following weighted average assumptions for fiscal year 2006:     risk-free interest rate of 4.25%, a dividend yield of zero     percent; a weighted average volatility factor of the expected     market price of Streamline Health s Common Stock of .823,     and a weighted average expected life of stock options of five     years. Future grants of equity awards accounted for as     stock-based compensation could have a material impact on     reported expenses depending upon the number, value and vesting     period of future awards.         At January 31, 2007 Streamline Health had two stock-based     compensation plans, which are more fully disclosed in     Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.         Pro forma information regarding the net earnings and net     earnings per common share is required by Statement 123 for     fiscal years 2005 and 2004 and has been determined as if     Streamline Health had accounted for its stock options under the     fair value method of that Statement. The fair value of these     options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes     option- pricing model with the following weighted average     assumptions for fiscal year 2005 and 2004: risk-free interest     rate of 4.25% for both years; a dividend yield of zero percent     for both years; a volatility factor of the expected market price     of Streamline Health s Common Stock of .842 in 2005 and     .864 in 2004, and a weighted average expected life of the     options of five years for both years.        43    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)        The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in     estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting     restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option     valuation models require the input of highly subjective     assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.     Because Streamline Health s stock options have     characteristics significantly different from those of traded     options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions     can materially affect the fair value estimate, in Streamline     Health s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily     provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock     options.                                             Fiscal Year                 2005           2004               Net earnings, as reported                 $       2,551,072               $       557,676          Deduct: Total stock based     compensation expense determined under the fair value based     method for all awards, net of related tax effects                     (74,227       )               (66,503       )                                            Pro forma net earnings                 $       2,476,845               $       491,173                                                Earnings per share:                                            Basic   as reported                 $       .28               $       .06                                                Basic   pro forma                 $       .27               $       .06                                                Diluted   as reported                 $       .27               $       .06                                                Diluted   pro forma                 $       .26               $       .06                                                   Net     Earnings Per Common Share         The net earnings per common share are computed in accordance     with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128,     Earnings per Share. The basic net earnings per common     share are computed based on the weighted average number of     common shares outstanding during each period. The diluted net     earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that     could occur if Stock Options, Stock Purchase Plan commitments     and Warrants were exercised into Common Stock, under certain     circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of     Streamline Health.         The following is the calculation of the basic and diluted net     earnings per share of common stock.

The diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year 2004, exclude     the effect of 249,589 outstanding Stock Options and the 750,000     Warrants because the inclusion would be antidilutive.           2.     Operating     Leases           Streamline Health rents office and data center space and     equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire at     various times through fiscal year 2010. Future minimum lease     payments under noncancelable operating leases for the next five     fiscal years are approximately as follows: 2007, $414,000; 2008,     $365,000; 2009, $342,000; 2010, $165,000 each year. Rent expense     was approximately $350,000, $287,000, and $253,000 for fiscal     years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. In February 2005,     Streamline Health entered into a sixty-six month lease for     office space. In connection with the lease, the property owner     provided a $326,000 build out allowance. As a further inducement     to rent the facilities, the owner provided the Company with the     use of the premises for six months rent free. The Company pays a     base rent and a proportional amount of the building operating     expenses, currently estimated at approximately $308,000 per     year. The lease has no renewal provisions and predetermined     increases in the base rent in 2007 and again in 2009.           3.     Long-term     Debt and Capitalized Leases           In January 2007, Streamline Health prepaid its then existing     term debt and entered into a new three year $5,000,000 working     capital revolving line of credit facility, with an option for     two one-year extensions. The loan is secured by all of the     assets of Streamline Health and the loan agreement restricts     Streamline Health from incurring additional indebtedness for     borrowed money, including capitalized leases, etc. without     lender consent. The Company is required to meet certain     financial covenants, including minimum level of tangible net     worth, minimum working capital, fixed charge ratio coverage and     funded indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes,     depreciation and amortization ratio (EBITDA). These requirements     may limit the borrowing under this credit agreement. At     January 31, 2007, the Company had the ability to utilize     $3,800,000 of the line of credit. Interest on this facility     ranges from Prime minus 1% to Prime based on the amount borrowed     to EBITDA. The Company pays a commitment fee on the unused     portion of the facility of .35%. Simultaneously with the signing     of the new agreement, the Company borrowed $1,000,000 under the     new agreement to prepay the then existing term loan balance that     was due in July 2007, which resulted in lowering the interest     rate to prime minus 1% on the outstanding debt. In February     2007, the Company repaid the then outstanding balance of the     revolving credit facility.         In 1998, Streamline Health issued a $6,000,000 note. In     connection with the issuance of the note, Streamline Health     issued Warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of Common Stock     of Streamline Health at $3.87 per share at any time through     July 16, 2008. The Warrants are subject to customary     antidilution and registration rights provisions.         Streamline Health believes the fair market value of the     revolving credit facility loan balance approximates the carrying     value based on the term, interest rate and maturity that     Streamline Health believes is currently available to it.         During the third quarter of fiscal year 2005, Streamline Health     acquired additional computer equipment for the     application-hosting services data center, which are accounted     for as capitalized leases. The amount of the computer equipment     leased assets is $267,237. The lease is payable monthly in     installments of $8,192, through August 2008. The present value     of the future lease payments upon lease inception was $267,237     using the interest rates implicit in the lease agreement at the     inception of the lease.        45    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)          The following is an analysis of the assets under capital lease     at the fiscal year end:                                             2006           2005               Computer equipment                 $       267,237               $       267,237          Accumulated depreciation                     (89,079       )               (22,270       )                                                       $       178,158               $       244,967                                                       Total depreciation and amortization expense on assets under     capital leases was $66,809 in 2006, $164,646 in 2005, and     $156,525 in 2004.         Total obligations under capital leases are as follows: $98,306     in 2007 and $57,346 in 2008.

As of January 31, 2007, Streamline Health reduced     the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets primarily     related to the carry forward by $1,875,000 based upon reasonable     future earnings before income tax projections. A valuation     allowance of $8,308,951 is still required to reduce the deferred     tax assets, primarily relating to loss carry forwards, to a     level currently believed will be utilized to offset future     earnings before income taxes based upon the current backlog and     forecasts over the next two years. The valuation allowance is     required due to the inability to predict on a longer term basis     that Streamline Health will  more likely than not      attain levels of profitability required to utilize additional     loss carry forwards.         At January 31, 2007, Streamline Health had a net operating     loss carry forward of approximately $28,000,000, which begins to     expire in 2013. Streamline Health also has an Alternative     Minimum Tax credit carry forward of approximately $74,000, which     has an unlimited carry forward period. Certain changes in stock     ownership can result in a limitation on the amount of net     operating loss carry forward that can be utilized each year.           5.     Retirement     Plan           Streamline Health has established a 401(k) retirement plan that     covers all employees. Company contributions to the plan may be     made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Effective     February 1, 2006, the Company began to match 100% up to the     first 4% of compensation deferred by each employee in the 401(k)     plan. The total compensation expense for this matching     contribution was $291,719 in 2006.           6.     Major     Customers           During fiscal year 2006, three customers, exclusive of our     remarketing partners, accounted for 11%, 8%, and 7% of total     revenues. During fiscal year 2005, three customers, exclusive of     our remarketing partners, accounted for 18%, 11%, and 10% of     total revenues. During fiscal year 2004, three customers,     exclusive of our remarketing partners, accounted for 13%, 13%,     and 7% of total revenues. At January 31, 2007 and 2006, 38%     and 60%, respectively, of Streamline Health s accounts     receivable were due from three customers excluding remarketing     partners. At January 31, 2007 and 2006 approximately, 20%     and 6%, respectively, of Streamline Health s accounts     receivables were due from remarketing partners.        47    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)            7.

At January 31, 2007, there was approximately $180,000 of     compensation cost that has not yet been recognized related to     nonvested stock-based awards. That cost is expected to be     recognized over a remaining weighted average period of two years.         Cash received from exercise of options and the employee stock     purchase plan was $85,318, $88,091 and $75,459, respectively, in     2006, 2005 and 2004.         The 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan and the 2005 Incentive     Compensation Plan contains change of control provisions whereby     any outstanding equity awards under the plans subject to     vesting, which have not fully vested as of the date of the     change in control, shall automatically vest and become     immediately exercisable. One of the change in control provisions     is deemed to occur if there is a change in beneficial ownership,     or authority to vote, directly or indirectly, securities     representing 20% or more of the total of all of Streamline     Health s then outstanding voting securities, unless through     a transaction arranged by, or consummated with the prior     approval of the Board of Directors. Other change in control     provisions relate to mergers and acquisitions or a determination     of change in control by Streamline Health s Board of     Directors.           8.     Employee     Stock Purchase Plan           Streamline Health has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under     which employees may purchase up to 500,000 shares of Common     Stock. Under the plan, eligible employees may elect to     contribute, through payroll deductions, up to 10% of their base     pay to a trust during any plan year, July 1 through     June 30, of the following year. At June 30 of each     year, the plan issues for the benefit of the employees shares of     Common Stock at the lesser of (a) 85% of the Fair Market     Value of the Common Stock on July 1, of the prior year, or     (b) 85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on     June 30, of the current year. At January 31, 2007,     339,330 shares remain that can be purchased under the plan.         During fiscal year 2006, 27,191 shares were purchased at     the price of $2.26 per share; 2005, 12,006 shares were     purchased at the price of $2.26 per share; and in 2004,     21,468 shares were purchased at the price of $1.66 per     share.         The purchase price at June 30, 2007, will be 85% of the     lower of (a) the closing price on July 3, 2006 ($5.27)     or (b) 85% of the closing price on June 30, 2007.        49    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)            9.     Commitments     and Contingencies       Maintenance     Agreements, Warranties, and Indemnities         Streamline Health warrants to customers that its software will     meet certain performance requirements for an initial limited     warranty period. Streamline Health has maintenance agreements to     provide services in future periods after the expiration of the     initial limited warranty period. Streamline Health invoices     customers in accordance with the agreements and records the     invoicing as deferred revenues and recognizes the revenues     ratably over the term of the maintenance agreements. Streamline     Health s standard agreements with its customers usually     include intellectual property infringement indemnification     provisions to indemnify them from and against third-party     claims, and for liabilities, damages, and expenses arising out     of Streamline Health s operation of its business or any     negligent act or omission of Streamline Health. At     January 31, 2007 and 2006, Streamline Health has a warranty     reserve in the amount of $250,000.     Application-hosting     Services         Streamline Health enters into long-term agreements to provide     document imaging/management and workflow services to its     healthcare customers on an outsourced basis from a central data     center. Streamline Health guarantees specific      up-time  and  response time  performance     standards, which, if not met may result in reduced revenues, as     a penalty, for the month in which the standards are not met.     Employment     Agreements         Streamline Health has entered into employment agreements with     its officers and employees that generally provide annual salary,     a minimum bonus, discretionary bonus, stock incentive     provisions, and severance arrangements.     Reserved     Common Stock         Streamline Health has reserved 1,630,830 shares of the     Common Stock authorized for issuance in connection with various     Equity Award Plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and     750,000 shares for the Warrants issued in connection with     the 1998 long-term debt.     Litigation         There are, from time to time, claims pending against Streamline     Health Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiary. Based on a review of     such litigation with legal counsel, Streamline Health believes     any resulting liability would not have a material affect on     Streamline Health s consolidated financial position or     results of operations.        50    Table of Contents     NOTES TO     CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL     STATEMENTS   (Continued)          10.

Item 9A.     Controls     and Procedures           Streamline Health maintains disclosure controls and procedures     that are designed to ensure that there is reasonable assurance     that the information required to be disclosed in Streamline     Health s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,     summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the     SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is     accumulated and communicated to Streamline Health s     management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief     Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions     regarding required disclosure based on the definition of      disclosure controls and procedures  in Exchange Act     Rules 13a-15(e)     and     15d-15(e).     In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and     procedures, management recognizes that any controls and     procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can     provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired     control objectives, and management necessarily was required to     apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship     of possible controls and procedures.         As of the end of the period covered by this report, an     evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the     participation of Streamline Health s senior management,     including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial     Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of     Streamline Health s disclosure controls and procedures to     provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives     of the disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that     evaluation, Streamline Health s management, including the     Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that     there is reasonable assurance that Streamline Health s     disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end     of the period covered by this report and there have been no     material changes in Streamline Health s internal control or     in the other controls during the quarter ended January 31,     2007 that could materially affect, or is reasonably likely to     materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.
