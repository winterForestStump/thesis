This can be calculated by taking the difference between the company's total revenues in FY2020 and FY2022, and dividing that by the number of years elapsed. Using the formula:\nTotal Revenue CAGR = (FY2020 Total Revenue - FY2022 Total Revenue) \/ Number of Years Elapsed\nPlugging in the values from the statement of income, we get:\nTotal Revenue CAGR = ($12,989 million - $14,367 million) \/ 2 = 5.6%\nTherefore, Lockheed Martin's 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022 was 5.6%.","103":"The answer is not in the provided information.

Adding this to the depreciation and amortization of $3.4 billion gives us the total unadjusted EBITDA of $10.3 billion.\nIt's worth noting that the term \"unadjusted EBITDA\" refers to the operating income plus depreciation and amortization calculated using the direct method of accounting for depreciation and amortization, rather than the indirect method used in the income statement.

In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program.

Investing in 3Ms business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Companys primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.

For licensed content, cash payment terms have historically been in line with the amortization period.

For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to significantly increase our investments in global streaming content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity and result in future negative free cash flows for many years.

For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. In addition, we include a factor of eight for rent expense that estimates the hypothetical capitalization of our operating leases. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP that is the most directly comparable financial measure to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities; and incorporates a factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.\nAlthough ROI is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\nNumerator\nConsolidated net income\n$\n10,523\n$\n14,293\nDenominator\nAverage total assets(1)\n$\n201,674\n$\n199,203\nReturn on assets (ROA)\n5.2\n%\n7.2\n%\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT\nNumerator","type":"Document"}],"18":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/936468_10K_2022_0000936468-23-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"936468","company":"LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-01-26","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"MD","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/936468\/000093646823000009\/lmt-20221231.htm","filename":"936468_10K_2022_0000936468-23-000009.htm"},"page_content":"In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt.

The Companys credit ratings have served to lower 3Ms borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit rating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. Moodys Investor Service downgraded the Companys credit rating from A1 to A2, and S&P Global Ratings downgraded the Companys credit rating from A to A- (and downgraded the Companys short-term credit rating from A-2 to A-1), in connection with the Companys announcement of the Settlement. The addition of further leverage to the Companys capital structure could impact 3Ms credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely affect the Companys cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"27. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","type":"Document"}],"24":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-09","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747623000007\/pep-20221231.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.htm"},"page_content":"2020 Acquisitions\nOn March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash.

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced periodically.

We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industrys broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/2488_10K_2022_0000002488-23-000047.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"2488","company":"ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-27","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1230","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/2488\/000000248823000047\/amd-20221231.htm","filename":"2488_10K_2022_0000002488-23-000047.htm"},"page_content":"See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 - The Company\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company.

Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (RR) and cost per point (CPP) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment.

Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $607 million impact on operating earnings.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments","type":"Document"}],"63":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/12927_10K_2022_0000012927-23-000007.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"12927","company":"BOEING CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-01-27","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/12927\/000001292723000007\/ba-20221231.htm","filename":"12927_10K_2022_0000012927-23-000007.htm"},"page_content":"Note 17 -

Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2021, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the BodyArmor trademark and $2.2 billion was preliminarily allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount preliminarily allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned to the North America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement when valuations are finalized.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/66740_10K_2018_0001558370-19-000470.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"66740","company":"3M CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-02-07","period_of_report":"2018-12-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/66740\/000155837019000470\/mmm-20181231x10k.htm","filename":"66740_10K_2018_0001558370-19-000470.htm"},"page_content":"* Change in the Companys credit ratings could increase cost of funding.

In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps.

The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of A or better.\nOn May 6, 2021, the Company entered into two 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts of $125 million and $150 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt, which was subsequently issued on May 10, 2021. These treasury lock agreements had an average fixed rate of 1.58%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss.

As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.
