These include fluctuations in sales volume due to global economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, and cost management strategies implemented by the company. However, I cannot provide specific figures without access to their financial reports.

Operating margin is a useful metric for companies like 3M as it measures profitability from core operations before interest and taxes.

However, it's essential to consider other financial metrics as well since the operating margin alone might not provide a comprehensive view of a company's performance. For instance, revenue growth and net income are also crucial indicators for evaluating Adobe's overall health and profitability.

Operating margin is still useful because it measures how efficiently a company generates profits from its operations by comparing operating income to total revenue.

Gross margin is indeed a useful metric as it indicates how efficiently a company generates revenue relative to its direct costs (cost of goods sold). A higher gross margin suggests that the company has better control over production costs, which can lead to increased profitability and competitiveness in their industry. However, if you believe that gross margin may not be an appropriate metric for evaluating AMCOR's performance, it could be due to factors such as a focus on service-based businesses or unique cost structures where other financial metrics like operating margin or net income might provide more insight into the company's overall health.",No. For AMCOR there has been a slight decline in gross margins by 0.8%.
