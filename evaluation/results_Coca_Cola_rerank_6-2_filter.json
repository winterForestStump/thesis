For example, the interest rate on short-term debt is likely to be the prevailing market rate at the time of borrowing, which was around 0.25% to 0.50% per annum in early 2023. Long-term debt, on the other hand, typically has a lower interest rate compared to short-term debt, as it is a longer-term obligation.

Based on the table provided, the COCA COLA CO's current assets were $168 billion, and its current liabilities were $107 billion, resulting in a current ratio of 1.57.\nThe quick ratio, also known as the acid test, is calculated by dividing the company's quick assets (current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses) by its current liabilities.

As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related to these derivatives of $14 million and $79 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and recorded a loss of $206 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income.

Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Companys performance.\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):","type":"Document"}],"3":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2018-02-23","period_of_report":"2017-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134418000008\/a2017123110-k.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.htm","relevance_score":0.9574280381},"page_content":"Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $357 million and $447 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
