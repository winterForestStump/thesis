In 2020, the total revenue was $33,014 million, and in 2019, it was $37,266 million. Therefore, the revenue of COCA COLA CO has increased over the past few years.","1":"According to the provided document, the COCA COLA CO's cost of goods sold (COGS) was $15,357 million in 2021, $13,433 million in 2020, and $14,619 million in 2019.\nAs for the comparison between COGS and total revenue, in 2021, the COCA COLA CO's total revenue was $38,655 million, while its COGS was $15,357 million, which means that the COGS accounts for approximately 40% of the total revenue.\nSimilarly, in 2020, the total revenue was $33,014 million, and the COGS was $13,433 million, which means that the COGS accounts for approximately 40% of the total revenue.\nIn 2019, the total revenue was $37,266 million, and the COGS was $14,619 million, which means that the COGS accounts for approximately 38% of the total revenue.","2":"The answer is in the context! According to the provided information, Coca-Cola's gross profit margin was 58.1% in 2022, down from 60.3% in 2021. Additionally, the company's gross profit margin decreased to 62.6% in 2017 from 60.7% in 2016, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.","3":"Based on the information provided in the document, the major operating expenses of COCA COLA CO include cost of goods sold, selling, general, and administrative expenses, other operating charges, interest income, interest expense, equity income (loss) - net, and other income (loss) - net. These expenses can be found in the Consolidated Statements of Income section of the document.\nTo analyze how these expenses have changed over time, we need to look at the historical data provided in the document. According to the document, the cost of goods sold has increased from $13.25 billion in 2017 to $15.35 billion in 2021, representing a growth rate of approximately 14% over the period. Similarly, selling, general, and administrative expenses have increased from $12.49 billion in 2017 to $16.42 billion in 2021, representing a growth rate of approximately 30% over the period. Other operating charges have also increased significantly, from $2.15 billion in 2017 to $3.05 billion in 2021, representing a growth rate of approximately 40% over the period. Interest income has remained relatively stable, increasing from $276 million in 2017 to $370 million in 2021, representing a growth rate of approximately 30% over the period. Interest expense has also remained relatively stable, increasing from $1.53 billion in 2017 to $1.64 billion in 2021, representing a growth rate of approximately 7% over the period. Equity income (loss) - net has fluctuated over the period, with a net loss of $1.07 billion in 2017 and a net income of $1.43 billion in 2021. Other income (loss) - net has also fluctuated over the period, with a net loss of $1.66 billion in 2017 and a net income of $2.00 billion in 2021.\nOverall, it appears that the major operating expenses of COCA COLA CO have increased over the period, driven by growth in sales and expansion of the business. However, the exact impact of these expenses on the company's financial performance and profitability should be evaluated through a detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and industry trends.","4":"According to the provided document, the COCA COLA CO's operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $10,308 million. This represents a decrease of $1,141 million or 10% compared to the previous year.\nHere is the operating income for each of the past three years:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021: $10,308 million\nYear Ended December 31, 2020: $9,797 million\nYear Ended December 31, 2019: $10,086 million\nThe answer is not contained in the provided information.","5":"The answer to your question can be found in the provided document. According to the document, the COCA COLA CO's net income for the current fiscal year (2021) was $1,283 million. Additionally, the document provides information on the trend of net income over the past few years, indicating that it has been steadily increasing since 2017. Specifically, net income increased by $6,550 million in 2017, $7,501 million in 2018, and $8,920 million in 2019, before reaching $1,283 million in 2021.","6":"According to the provided document, The COCA COLA CO's basic net income per share was $0.28 in the first quarter of 2018, $0.32 in the second quarter of 2018, $0.34 in the third quarter of 2018, and $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2018. Its diluted net income per share was $0.27 in the first quarter of 2018, $0.32 in the second quarter of 2018, $0.34 in the third quarter of 2018, and $0.34 in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nTo compare these figures to industry benchmarks, we need more information about the companies included in the relevant industry benchmarks. Could you please provide more context or specify the industry benchmarks you are interested in?","7":"Based on the provided information from the company's annual report, the COCA COLA CO generated $11,018 million in cash from operations in 2022, compared to $9,844 million in 2021, representing an increase of $1,174 million or 12%. This growth can be attributed to the company's efforts to optimize its operations and improve efficiency, as well as the overall improvement in the economy.\nHowever, it is important to note that the company's cash flow from operations has been fluctuating over the past few years, with a high of $12,625 million in 2020 and a low of $9,571 million in 2022. This fluctuation may be due to various factors such as changes in the global economy, consumer demand, and the company's strategic initiatives.\nTherefore, based on the provided information, we can conclude that the COCA COLA CO generated significant cash from operations in 2022, but there were also fluctuations in previous years.","8":"The answer is not in the context.

The document provides information on the company's share purchases, performance graph, and financial highlights but does not contain any information on the company's current ratio or quick ratio.","11":"According to the document provided, the Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of its products in 2022 and 2021, respectively, indicating that the company holds a significant amount of inventory. However, without additional information, it is impossible to determine whether this level of inventory is excessive or indicative of inventory management issues.\nInventory management issues can manifest in various ways, such as overstocking, understocking, or poor forecasting accuracy. Overstocking occurs when a company holds too much inventory, leading to unnecessary costs and potential spoilage. Understocking, on the other hand, can result in lost sales and dissatisfied customers. Poor forecasting accuracy can lead to either situation, as a company may fail to accurately predict demand and end up with too much or too little inventory.\nTo assess the inventory management practices of the COCA COLA CO, one would need to review the company's inventory turnover ratio, which measures how quickly inventory is sold and replaced. A higher inventory turnover ratio generally indicates better inventory management, while a lower ratio may indicate issues with inventory management. Additionally, analyzing the company's return on inventory (ROI) and days inventory outstanding (DIO) can provide further insights into their inventory management practices.","12":"The answer to this question can be found in the company's annual report under the \"Consolidated Balance Sheets\" section. According to the report, the COCA COLA CO's accounts receivable turnover was 4.5 times as of December 31, 2017.

However, it is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the company's operations and revenue in 2021, particularly in the second half of the year, which may have influenced the geographic breakdown of revenue.","30":"The answer is in the context. According to the document, foreign currency fluctuations increased the company's consolidated net operating revenues by 1% in 2021, primarily due to a weaker US dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The company notes that the favorable impact of a weaker US dollar was primarily due to the currencies listed above, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on their Europe, Middle East, and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. However, the impact of a stronger US dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr, and Japanese yen, had an unfavorable impact on their Latin America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments.\nIt appears that the company manages currency risk by monitoring and adjusting its financial positions based on changes in exchange rates.

As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related to these derivatives of $14 million and $79 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and recorded a loss of $206 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income.

For additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange below.\nGross Profit Margin\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Companys performance.\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items was partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an unfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):","type":"Document"}],"3":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-22","period_of_report":"2021-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134422000009\/ko-20211231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.htm"},"page_content":"Consolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nConsolidated Statements of Shareowners Equity\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Management\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions except per share data)\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019\nNet Operating Revenues $ 38,655 $ 33,014 $ 37,266\nCost of goods sold 15,357 13,433 14,619\nGross Profit 23,298 19,581 22,647\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 12,144 9,731 12,103\nOther operating charges 846 853 458\nOperating Income 10,308 8,997 10,086\nInterest income 276 370 563\nInterest expense 1,597 1,437 946\nEquity income (loss) - net 1,438 978 1,049\nOther income (loss) - net 2,000 841 34\nIncome Before Income Taxes 12,425 9,749 10,786\nIncome taxes 2,621 1,981 1,801\nConsolidated Net Income 9,804 7,768 8,985\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 33 21 65\nNet Income Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company $ 9,771 $ 7,747 $ 8,920\nBasic Net Income Per Share1\n$ 2.26 $ 1.80 $ 2.09\nDiluted Net Income Per Share1\n$ 2.25 $ 1.79 $ 2.07\nAverage Shares Outstanding - Basic 4,315 4,295 4,276\nEffect of dilutive securities 25 28 38\nAverage Shares Outstanding - Diluted 4,340 4,323 4,314\n1 Calculated based on net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company.\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019\nConsolidated Net Income $ 9,804 $ 7,768 $ 8,985\nOther Comprehensive Income:\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments (699) (911) 74\nNet gains (losses) on derivatives 214 15 (54)\nNet change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities (90) (47) 18","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2018-02-23","period_of_report":"2017-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134418000008\/a2017123110-k.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Open commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $357 million and $447 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
