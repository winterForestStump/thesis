According to the document, currency fluctuations can have an adverse impact on the company's financial performance. The company pays for ingredients, raw materials, and commodities used in its business in various currencies, and fluctuations in exchange rates can affect its financial performance. Additionally, the company's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which means that the financial statements of its subsidiaries outside the US, where the functional currency is other than the US dollar, are translated into US dollars. This means that fluctuations in exchange rates can also affect the company's financial performance.\nTo manage currency risk, the company may use various hedging strategies, such as forward contracts, options, and swaps, to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on its financial performance. However, it is important to note that these hedging strategies may not always be effective, and the company may still be exposed to currency risks. Therefore, it is essential for the company to monitor and manage currency risks carefully to minimize their impact on its financial performance.","31":"Based on the provided document, the following are the critical accounting policies disclosed by The Coca-Cola Company:\n1. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its obligations under contracts with customers, which typically involves delivering products to customers or providing services. Revenue is recognized net of returns and allowances.\n2. Inventory Valuation: The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.\n3. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets: The Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.\n4. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans: The Company recognizes expense for pension and postretirement benefit plans based on the expected future payment obligations.\n5. Share-Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the fair value of the awards.\n6. Deferred Taxes: The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities.\n7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities: The Company uses derivatives to manage currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks. The Company records the fair value of these derivatives in the statement of income.\n8. Business Combinations: The Company follows the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, which requires the recognition of identifiable assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests acquired in the combination.\n9. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset's carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n10. Employee Retirement Plans: The Company recognizes expense for employee retirement plans based on the expected future payment obligations.\n\nChanges in these critical accounting policies could significantly impact the Company's financial statements, particularly those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, goodwill and other intangible assets, share-based compensation, deferred taxes, derivatives and hedging activities, business combinations, and impairment of long-lived assets. For instance, a change in the revenue recognition policy could result in different amounts of revenue recognized in different periods, while a change in inventory valuation policy could lead to higher or lower inventory costs reported in the financial statements. Similarly, changes in accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, share-based compensation, deferred taxes, derivatives and hedging activities, business combinations, and impairment of long-lived assets could result in different amounts of expenses recognized in the financial statements. Therefore, it is essential to carefully review and analyze the Company's critical accounting policies to understand their potential impact on the financial statements.","32":"Based on the information provided in the document, the Coca-Cola Company had a net pension and other postretirement benefit liability of $354 million in 2022, which represents an increase of $267 million compared to the previous year.
