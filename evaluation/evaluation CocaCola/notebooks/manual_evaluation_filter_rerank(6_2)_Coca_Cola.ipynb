For example, the interest rate on short-term debt is likely to be the prevailing market rate at the time of borrowing, which was around 0.25% to 0.50% per annum in early 2023. Long-term debt, on the other hand, typically has a lower interest rate compared to short-term debt, as it is a longer-term obligation. As of December 31, 2022, the weighted average interest rate on long-term debt was 4.3% per annum.\n",

According to the document, the company uses derivative financial instruments to further reduce its net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect their financial results. Additionally, the document states that foreign currency fluctuations decreased their consolidated net operating revenues by 3%, with a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies having an unfavorable impact on their Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments.\n",
