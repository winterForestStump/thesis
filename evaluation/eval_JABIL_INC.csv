What is the JABIL INC's current ratio and quick ratio and how do these ratios compare to industry averages?,"Based on the provided information, the JABIL INC's current ratio and quick ratio are not explicitly mentioned. However, the information does provide some insight into the company's liquidity position. For example, it states that the company's working capital requirements are largely affected by its sales cycle and inventory management, which suggests that JABIL INC has a significant amount of current assets to support its operations. Additionally, the information provides details on the company's sales cycle, inventory turns, and accounts receivable and payable days, which can be used to estimate the company's liquidity position. To provide a more accurate answer, additional information would be necessary, such as JABIL INC's latest balance sheet and income statement. However, based on the provided information, it appears that JABIL INC has a solid liquidity position, with a significant amount of current assets and a relatively short accounts receivable period. This could indicate that the company has a good ability to meet its short-term financial obligations and maintain its operations.","The current ratio and quick ratio of JABIL INC as of August 31, 2023, are not provided directly in the given information. However, we can calculate these ratios using the information available in the consolidated financial statements.

The current ratio is calculated by dividing the current assets by the current liabilities:

Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities

As per the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, the current assets and current liabilities for JABIL INC as of August 31, 2023, are:

Current Assets:

* Cash and cash equivalents: $578 million
* Accounts receivable, net: $4,697 million
* Inventory: $2,553 million
* Prepaid expenses and other current assets: $279 million

Total Current Assets: $7,537 million

Current Liabilities:

* Accounts payable: $2,924 million
* Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: $1,347 million
* Short-term debt: $150 million

Total Current Liabilities: $4,421 million

Now, let's calculate the current ratio:

Current Ratio = Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities
= $7,537 million / $4,421 million
= 1.70

So, the current ratio of JABIL INC as of August 31, 2023, is 1.70.

Quick Ratio:

The quick ratio is similar to the current ratio, but it excludes inventory from the calculation.

Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities

Using the same figures as above:

Quick Ratio = ($7,537 million - $2,553 million) / $4,421 million
= $5,084 million / $4,421 million
= 1.15

Therefore, the quick ratio of JABIL INC as of August 31, 2023, is 1.15.

Industry Averages:
The industry averages for current ratio and quick ratio vary across different industries. However, as a general rule, a current ratio above 2 and a quick ratio above 1 are considered good indicators of liquidity.

In comparison, the current ratio and quick ratio of JABIL INC as of August 31, 2023, are 1.70 and 1.15, respectively. These ratios indicate that JABIL INC has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations and is in a relatively strong position to pay its bills on time.","{'lc_attributes': {}, 'lc_secrets': {}, 'metadata': {'source': '/content/files/898293_10K_2023_0001193125-23-259599.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'cik': '898293', 'company': 'JABIL INC', 'filing_type': '10-K', 'filing_date': '2023-10-20', 'period_of_report': '2023-08-31', 'state_location': 'FL', 'fiscal_year_end': '0831', 'htm_filing_link': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/898293/000119312523259599/d533726d10k.htm', 'filename': '898293_10K_2023_0001193125-23-259599.htm'}, 'page_content': 'anticipated to close within the first two quarters of our fiscal year 2024 (which is the period from September 1, 2023 through February 29, 2024), and is subject to closing conditions, including required regulatory approvals.\nSee Note 13 - Concentration of Risk and Segment Data to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSummary of Results\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain key operating results and other financial information (in millions, except per share data):\nFiscal Year Ended August 31,\nNet revenue $ 34,702\n$ 33,478\n$ 29,285\nGross profit $ 2,867\n$ 2,632\n$ 2,359\nOperating income\n$ 1,537\n$ 1,393\n$ 1,055\nNet income attributable to Jabil Inc.\n$\n$\n$\nEarnings per share - basic\n$ 6.15\n$ 7.06\n$ 4.69\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$ 6.02\n$ 6.90\n$ 4.58\nKey Performance Indicators\nManagement regularly reviews financial and non-financial performance indicators to assess the Companys operating results.

What is the JABIL INC's accounts receivable turnover and are there any concerns regarding receivables aging?,"The answer is not in the context. The document does not provide enough information to calculate the accounts receivable turnover for JABIL INC. Additionally, there is no mention of any concerns regarding receivables aging.","The accounts receivable turnover for JABIL INC. is not explicitly stated in the provided information. However, we can calculate it using the information available.

The company's accounts receivable balance at the end of August 31, 2023, was $3,647 million, and its net sales for the year ended August 31, 2023, were $19,424 million. Therefore, we can calculate the accounts receivable turnover as follows:

Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Sales / Average Accounts Receivable

Average Accounts Receivable = (Beginning Accounts Receivable + Ending Accounts Receivable) / 2

= ($3,995 million + $3,647 million) / 2
= $3,821 million

Now, we can calculate the accounts receivable turnover:

Accounts Receivable Turnover = $19,424 million / $3,821 million

This means that on average, JABIL INC. collects its accounts receivable 5.06 times per year.

Regarding concerns about receivables aging, the company does not provide any specific information about the age of its accounts receivable. However, based on the accounts receivable turnover calculation above, it appears that the company has a relatively low accounts receivable turnover compared to industry benchmarks, which could indicate that its accounts are aging slower than expected.

How does the JABIL INC's management view the JABIL INC performance?,"According to the document, JABIL INC's management views the company's performance based on several key financial indicators, including: 1. Sales cycle: This refers to the time it takes to convert manufacturing services into cash through sales. Management tracks this indicator to assess the efficiency of the sales process. 2. Inventory turns: This metric measures how quickly the company sells and replaces its inventory. Higher inventory turns indicate better inventory management and a more efficient supply chain. 3. Days in accounts receivable: This indicator shows how long it takes to collect payment from customers. Lower days in accounts receivable indicate better cash flow management and a healthier business. 4. Days in inventory: This metric shows how long the company holds onto inventory before selling it. Lower days in inventory indicate better inventory management and a more efficient supply chain. 5. Days in accounts payable: This indicator shows how long it takes to pay suppliers and vendors. Lower days in accounts payable indicate better cash flow management and a healthier business. By tracking these key performance indicators, JABIL INC's management can assess the company's financial health and identify areas for improvement.","The management of JABIL INC views the company's performance positively, highlighting its financial and non-financial performance indicators. In the annual report, management notes that changes in operating assets and liabilities are largely affected by working capital requirements, which are dependent on the effective management of the sales cycle as well as timing of payments. They also mention that they believe the metrics set forth in the report are useful to investors in measuring liquidity, as future liquidity needs will depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Additionally, they provide key performance indicators such as sales cycle, inventory turns, days in accounts receivable, days in inventory, and days in accounts payable to assess the company's liquidity. Overall, the management seems optimistic about the company's performance and liquidity.","{'lc_attributes': {}, 'lc_secrets': {}, 'metadata': {'source': '/content/files/898293_10K_2023_0001193125-23-259599.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'cik': '898293', 'company': 'JABIL INC', 'filing_type': '10-K', 'filing_date': '2023-10-20', 'period_of_report': '2023-08-31', 'state_location': 'FL', 'fiscal_year_end': '0831', 'htm_filing_link': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/898293/000119312523259599/d533726d10k.htm', 'filename': '898293_10K_2023_0001193125-23-259599.htm'}, 'page_content': '32.1*\nSection 1350 Certification by the Chief Executive Officer of the Registrant.\n32.2*\nSection 1350 Certification by the Chief Financial Officer of the Registrant.\nThe following financial information from Jabils Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended August 31, 2023, formatted in Inline XBRL: (i) Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022; (ii) Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021; (iii) Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021; (iv) Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Stockholders Equity for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021; (v) Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021; and (vi) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCover Page Interactive Data File (Embedded within the inline XBRL Document in Exhibit 101).\nIndicates management compensatory plan, contract of arrangement.\n*\nFiled or furnished herewith.\n**\nCertain portions of this exhibit have been redacted pursuant to Item 601(b)(10)(iv) of Regulation S-K.

What is the JABIL INC's dividend history and how sustainable are the dividend payouts?,"According to the document provided, JABIL INC has a history of paying dividends to its shareholders. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, the company paid out $818 million in dividends, representing a payout ratio of 21.6% based on net income. This means that for every dollar of net income, the company paid out $0.216 in dividends. To determine the sustainability of these dividend payouts, we need to analyze the company's cash flow and balance sheet. According to the document, JABIL INC had net revenues of $34.7 billion and net income attributable to Jabil Inc. of $818 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. The company also had a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, totaling $4.5 billion, which can be used to fund dividend payments. However, it's important to note that the company also had a significant amount of debt, totaling $4.3 billion, which could impact its ability to sustainably pay dividends in the future. A high level of debt can limit the company's financial flexibility and increase its borrowing costs, making it more difficult to maintain dividend payments. In conclusion, while JABIL INC has a history of paying dividends and has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund these payments, the company's high level of debt may make it challenging to sustainably pay dividends in the future without implementing cost-cutting measures or reducing debt levels.","The answer is not in the context.

How does the JABIL INC manage currency risk and are there impacts on financials due to currency fluctuations?,"The answer is in the context. According to the document, JABIL INC manages currency risk through the use of derivatives as risk management tools to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks, including foreign currency risk. The company uses forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk associated with anticipated foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses. As of August 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, the company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $491 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. These contracts are designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The company also disclosed that it faces exposure to currency exchange rates due to its global operations and that an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to its customers of its products in markets outside the United States where it sells in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of materials or services that it purchases in foreign currencies.

What are the JABIL INC's critical accounting policies disclosed and how might changes in these policies affect financial statements?,"According to the document provided, Jabil Inc.'s critical accounting policies include: 1. Loss Contingencies: Jabil estimates the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. 2. Accounting for Acquisitions: Jabil evaluates the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, and records the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value as goodwill. Changes in these policies may significantly impact Jabil's financial statements, as they affect the estimation of losses, the valuation of assets and liabilities, and the recognition of revenue and expenses. For instance, if Jabil experiences changes in the probability of loss or impairment of assets, it may require adjustments to the estimated loss contingency accruals. Similarly, changes in the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities may result in different values being recorded on the balance sheet. Therefore, it is essential to carefully consider and disclose any changes in these critical accounting policies to ensure transparency and accuracy in the financial statements.","The critical accounting policies disclosed by JABIL INC are:

1. Loss contingencies: The company is subject to various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, and it recognizes an estimated loss contingency when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
2. Accounting for acquisitions: The company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition.

Changes in these policies could affect the financial statements by impacting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, if the company were to change its estimate of a loss contingency, it could result in a different expense being recognized in the financial statements. Similarly, changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with an acquisition could impact the reported financial results.","{'lc_attributes': {}, 'lc_secrets': {}, 'metadata': {'source': '/content/files/932021_10K_2022_0001493152-22-028326.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'cik': '932021', 'company': 'GLOBAL TECHNOLOGIES LTD', 'filing_type': '10-K', 'filing_date': '2022-10-13', 'period_of_report': '2022-06-30', 'state_location': 'NJ', 'fiscal_year_end': '0630', 'htm_filing_link': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/932021/000149315222028326/form10-k.htm', 'filename': '932021_10K_2022_0001493152-22-028326.htm'}, 'page_content': 'Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

The Company considers the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as its ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when management concludes that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
