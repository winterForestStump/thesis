Increases in debt related to October 2017 debt issuances of $2.0 billion, commercial paper of $745 million outstanding at year end 2017, and the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries. These are partially offset by June 2017 repayments of $650 million aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes and the October 2017 $305 million debt tender. Net commercial paper issuances and repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in Change in short-term debt - net in the preceding table. Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances.\nProceeds from debt for 2017 primarily related to the October 2017 issuance of $650 million aggregate principal amount of 5.5-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2023 with a coupon rate of 2.25%, $850 million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2027 with a coupon rate of 2.875%, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2047 with a coupon rate of 3.625%. Refer to Note 12 for more detail of these debt issuances.\nIn October 2017, via cash tender offers, 3M repurchased $305 million aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $110 million of its $330 million principal amount of 6.375% notes due 2028 and $195 million of its $750 million principal amount of 5.70% notes due 2037. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense associated with the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses.\n2016 Debt Activity:', 'Total Debt:\nThe strength of 3Ms capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Companys maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service.\nThe Companys total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its well-known seasoned issuer (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3Ms previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Companys medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.']"," The company's total outstanding debt at December 31, 2017, was $2.3 billion higher than in 2016.

Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\nRelated Party Activity:\n3M does not have any material related party activity.\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings', 'NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\t\t\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nThe strength and stability of 3Ms business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3Ms businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3Ms primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nTotal Debt:']", I don't have the specific information on the company's total outstanding debt from the provided context.
