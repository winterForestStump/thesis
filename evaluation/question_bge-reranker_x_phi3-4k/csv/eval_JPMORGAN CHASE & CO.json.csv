After these goals are achieved, the intent is to remove the Firms capital from the investment.\nShelf securities: Securities registered with the SEC under a\nshelf registration statement that have not been issued,\noffered or sold.

The notes typically contain embedded (but not separable or detachable) derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal, interest, or both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of traditional interest rates or indexes.\nSuspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but are currently on hold, which could be due to bankruptcy or loss mitigation.

An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a hybrid. The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the host. For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative).

Net realizable value is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (transaction costs). Transaction costs for the Firms physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firms physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value.
