This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the company's efforts to optimize its supply chain and reduce costs, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.\n",
            "However, it is important to note that the cash flow generated from operations has been fluctuating over the past few years, with significant variations observed in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In particular, the cash flow generated from operations in fiscal year 2020 was $6,657 million, which is higher than the amount observed in fiscal year 2021. This may be due to various factors, such as changes in the company's business strategy or economic conditions affecting its operations.\n",
            "Overall, while the cash flow generated from operations has shown an increasing trend over the past few years, it is essential to analyze the company's financial performance in more detail to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.\n",

According to the provided information, NIKE manages its foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address risks material to NIKE, Inc. The company takes advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and hedges a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and the foreign currency adjustment program enhanced the company's ability to manage its foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within its portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Additionally, the company's hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged.\n",

The company has implemented IT systems in all geographical regions where it operates and continues to invest in enhancing and securing these systems. However, NIKE acknowledges that these systems may be negatively impacted by service interruptions or shutdowns, and it cannot provide assurance that the measures taken to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss.
