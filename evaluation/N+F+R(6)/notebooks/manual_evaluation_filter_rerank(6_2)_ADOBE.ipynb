According to the text, unanticipated changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where the company's income is earned could affect its future results of operations, and the company's future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it does business. Additionally, the company mentions that the United States, countries in the European Union, and other countries where it does business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect the company's effective tax rates or result in other costs to it.\n",

According to the document, the company has a stock repurchase program aimed at returning value to its stockholders and minimizing dilution from stock issuances. The program allows the company to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, the company entered into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, which allowed it to repurchase shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume-weighted average price of its common stock over a specified period of time. The company only enters into such transactions when the discount received is higher than its estimated foregone return on its cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases.\n",
