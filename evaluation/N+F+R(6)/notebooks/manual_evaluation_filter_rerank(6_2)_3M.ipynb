According to the document, 3M CO's key risks include foreign exchange rate, interest rate, and commodity price fluctuations, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. To mitigate these risks, the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options, and swaps to hedge against the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows and offsets, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items. Additionally, the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and enters into interest rate swaps to manage borrowing costs.

According to the document, 3M CO manages currency risk through the use of interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. These instruments help the company manage risks associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate, and commodity price fluctuations. Additionally, the document states that the Company estimates that year-over-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This suggests that the Company is actively managing currency risk through these instruments and that there are impacts on financials due to currency fluctuations.\n",
