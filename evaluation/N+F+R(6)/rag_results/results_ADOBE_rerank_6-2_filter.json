Meanwhile, the company's total revenue has increased steadily during the same period, going from $3.0 billion in 2014 to $4.7 billion in 2016.\nUsing the information provided, we can calculate the COGS as a percentage of total revenue for each fiscal year:\nFiscal Year 2016: $331.0 million \/ $7,301.5 million = 0.045\nFiscal Year 2015: $287.5 million \/ $5,854.4 million = 0.050\nFiscal Year 2014: $245.4 million \/ $4.7 billion = 0.052\nFrom the calculations above, we can see that Adobe Systems Inc.'s COGS as a percentage of total revenue has remained relatively stable over the past three fiscal years, ranging between 0.045 and 0.052. This suggests that the company's cost of goods sold has remained relatively constant as a proportion of its total revenue.","2":"The answer is not in the provided information.

This is compared to an operating income of $1,493,602 for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of $674,493 or 45%.\nThe answer is not found in the provided information as there is no context provided for the operating income of Adobe Systems Inc. beyond the year ended December 1, 2017.","5":"According to the provided document, Adobe Systems Incorporated's net income for the current fiscal year (2016) is $629,551. Over the past few years, net income has trended upward, increasing from $268,395 in 2015 to $289,985 in 2016.","6":"Based on the information provided in the document, Adobe Systems Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) for the year ending November 27, 2015 was $2.69. This can be calculated by dividing the company's net income by its total number of shares outstanding.\nTo compare this to industry benchmarks, we need to look at the EPS of other companies within the same industry. According to a report by Yahoo Finance, the average EPS for companies in the Technology sector was $10.54 for the same period. Therefore, Adobe Systems Inc.'s EPS of $2.69 is lower than the industry average.\nIt is important to note that EPS can vary significantly depending on various factors such as revenue growth, profit margins, and the number of shares outstanding. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the company's financial performance in relation to these factors to get a clearer picture of its financial health.","7":"The answer is in the context. According to the document, ADobe Systems Inc generated $2.91 billion in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the document states that the primary sources of cash are receipts from revenue, while the primary uses of cash are payroll-related expenses, general operating expenses, including marketing, travel, and office rent, and cost of revenue. There are also other sources of cash, such as proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan, and other uses of cash, such as stock repurchases and business acquisitions. However, the document does not provide detailed information about any notable trends or fluctuations in the company's cash flow from operations.","8":"The answer is not provided in the given document.

The capital lease obligations were $3,269 as of November 27, 2015, and $nil as of November 28, 2014.\nThe interest rates on the debt are not specified in the provided document.","10":"Based on the provided annual report information, Adobe Systems Inc.'s current ratio and quick ratio are as follows:\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets \/ Current Liabilities = 5,839,774 \/ 2,811,635 = 2.04\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) \/ Current Liabilities = 5,839,774 - 1,945,619 = 3.87\nTo compare these ratios to industry averages, we need to refer to a reliable industry benchmark dataset. Unfortunately, I cannot provide such data without additional information about the specific industry or sector you are interested in. However, you can consult financial databases or industry reports to find the average current ratio and quick ratio values for your chosen industry.\nOnce you have access to the relevant industry data, you can calculate the industry average current ratio and quick ratio using the following formulae:\nIndustry Average Current Ratio = Sum of Current Ratios of All Companies in the Industry \/ Number of Companies in the Industry\nIndustry Average Quick Ratio = Sum of Quick Ratios of All Companies in the Industry \/ Number of Companies in the Industry\nBy comparing Adobe Systems Inc.'s current ratio and quick ratio to the industry averages, you can assess how well the company is managing its short-term assets and liabilities relative to its peers within the selected industry.","11":"The answer is not in the provided context. The document you provided is an auditor's report on Adobe Systems Incorporated's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, but it does not provide information on the company's inventory levels or any signs of inventory management issues.","12":"The answer to your question can be found in the provided annual report information. According to the document, Adobe Systems Inc.'s accounts receivable turnover for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014 were as follows:\n* Fiscal Year 2016: 4.33 times\n* Fiscal Year 2015: 4.24 times\n* Fiscal Year 2014: 4.19 times\nBased on these figures, it appears that Adobe Systems Inc.'s accounts receivable turnover has remained relatively consistent over the past three fiscal years. However, there may be concerns regarding receivables aging, as the document also shows that the company's accounts receivable balance increased by $187.1 million, $160.4 million, and $79.5 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. This could indicate that the company's customers are taking longer to pay their bills, which could potentially impact Adobe Systems Inc.'s cash flow and financial performance.","13":"The answer is not in the provided information. The document only provides information about Adobe Systems Incorporated's business, products, and services, but does not provide any information about its market share or how it has changed over the years.","14":"Based on the provided document, the answer to your question is not found within the text.

The document only provides information about the company's annual report, including its financial statements, management's discussion and analysis, and certain legal and regulatory disclosures. However, there is no direct information about the company's key risks or how it plans to mitigate them.","16":"Based on the provided information, the answer is: The answer is not in the context.

The case was consolidated into In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation (HTEAL) and settled during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Therefore, the answer is yes, there was an ongoing legal proceeding against Adobe Systems Inc. related to this matter.","19":"The answer is in the context. According to the provided information, legal issues could potentially have a significant impact on the business of ADOBE SYSTEMS INC, such as:\n* Regulatory and environmental challenges related to climate change could affect the company's ability to operate in certain locations or partner with other organizations.\n* Loss of key personnel could harm the company's business, especially if the company has not developed adequate succession plans.\n* Legal issues related to intellectual property rights could result in costly litigation and damage to the company's reputation.\n* Impairment of the company's investment portfolio due to deterioration of the financial markets could result in financial losses.","20":"According to the provided document, the effective tax rate for ADOBE SYSTEMS INC in 2015 was 24.139%. This can be calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes ($244,230) by the income before income taxes ($873,781).","21":"The answer is yes, there are tax-related risks and benefits mentioned in the provided text. According to the text, unanticipated changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where the company's income is earned could affect its future results of operations, and the company's future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it does business. Additionally, the company mentions that the United States, countries in the European Union, and other countries where it does business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect the company's effective tax rates or result in other costs to it.\nHowever, the text also mentions that the company has been able to benefit from certain tax-related items, such as discrete items and earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations, which have resulted in a difference between its income tax expense and the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate.","22":"According to the provided information, Adobe Systems Inc.'s research and development expenses for the year ending December 2, 2017 were $975,987.","23":"The answer is not in the provided context.

Additionally, the sustainability of the company's dividend payouts can be evaluated by analyzing their financial health, including their revenue growth, profitability, cash flow generation, and debt levels.","25":"Yes, Adobe Systems Inc has engaged in share buyback programs. According to the document, the company has a stock repurchase program aimed at returning value to its stockholders and minimizing dilution from stock issuances. The program allows the company to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, the company entered into structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, which allowed it to repurchase shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume-weighted average price of its common stock over a specified period of time. The company only enters into such transactions when the discount received is higher than its estimated foregone return on its cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases.","26":"The answer is not in the provided information. The document only provides information about the company's operations, basis of presentation, and significant accounting policies, but it does not provide details on employee benefits offered by the company.","27":"The answer is not in the provided information.

According to the provided documents, Adobe Systems Inc attempts to mitigate currency risks through foreign currency hedging based on its judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. However, the company acknowledges that its hedging activities may not fully offset the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable currency exchange rate movements, which could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the company notes that failure of its third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customer requests could harm its business and adversely affect its financial results.","31":"Based on the provided documents, ADOBE SYSTEMS INC discloses the following critical accounting policies:\n1. Revenue Recognition: The company recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met, including persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the product or service, fixation of the fee, and collectibility.

Multiple Element Arrangements: The company enters into multiple element revenue arrangements, which involve a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance, and support, hosted services, and consulting. The company recognizes revenue based on the separate earnings potential of each element, and any allocation of revenue between elements is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) or third-party evidence (TPE). Changes in these criteria could impact the allocation of revenue between elements.\nNo additional critical accounting policies are disclosed in the provided documents.","32":"Based on the provided Adobe Systems Inc.'s annual report, there is no direct information about the pension obligations and contributions in the consolidated financial statements.

The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision

We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time.

We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements.
