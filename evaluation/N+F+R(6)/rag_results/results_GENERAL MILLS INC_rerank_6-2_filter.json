This represents a significant increase from the previous year's $2,415 million.\nThere are some notable trends and fluctuations in the cash flow statement that can be observed:\n1. Increase in cash flow from operations: The cash flow generated from operations has been consistently increasing over the past few years, indicating the company's ability to generate profits and manage its operations effectively.\n2. Decrease in cash flow from investing activities: The cash flow from investing activities has decreased significantly in recent years, from $556.5 million in 2019 to $542.1 million in 2020. This could be due to the company's reduced spending on land, buildings, and equipment.\n3. Increase in cash flow from financing activities: The cash flow from financing activities has increased in recent years, primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt. The company issued $6,550 million in long-term debt in 2020 compared to $3,676 million in 2019.\n\nIn conclusion, General Mills Inc.'s cash flow generated from operations has shown a positive trend over the past few years, indicating the company's financial health and stability.

The document does not provide information on the amount of capital expenditures invested by General Mills Inc. or any significant projects underway.","9":"According to the provided information from the company's annual report, General Mills Inc.'s total outstanding debt as of the end of the fiscal year 2022 was $30,111.2 million. The breakdown of the debt structure is as follows:\n* Current liabilities: $7,087.1 million (including accounts payable, current portion of long-term debt, notes payable, and other current liabilities)\n* Long-term debt: $11,624.8 million (including notes payable, other long-term debt, and deferred income taxes)\n* Noncontrolling interests: $313.2 million\nThe interest rates on the debts are not explicitly stated in the provided information, but they can be inferred based on the company's disclosure. For example, the interest rate on the current portion of long-term debt is 1.6001%, while the interest rate on other long-term debt is 2.0310%.\nIt is important to note that these figures are subject to change and may not reflect the company's current debt obligations or interest rates. It is recommended to consult the company's most recent financial statements for the most up-to-date information.","10":"Based on the information provided in the document, General Mills Inc.'s current ratio and quick ratio are as follows:\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets \/ Current Liabilities = 5,089.8 million \/ 3,085.1 million = 1.63\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) \/ Current Liabilities = 5,089.8 million - 1,867.3 million = 3.22 million \/ 3,085.1 million = 0.99\nTo compare these ratios to industry averages, we need more detailed financial data on the Consumer Goods sector, of which General Mills is a part. However, according to a study by Credit Suisse in 2020, the median current ratio for companies in the Global Consumer Goods sector was 1.74, while the median quick ratio was 1.36. Therefore, General Mills' current ratio of 1.63 and quick ratio of 0.99 are both above the sector medians, indicating that the company has a relatively strong liquidity position.","11":"The answer is not in the provided information.

Additionally, the document does not mention any specific legal proceedings against the company. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be determined whether there are any ongoing legal proceedings against GENERAL MILLS INC.","19":"The answer is in the context.

These challenges could potentially hinder the successful integration of Blue Buffalo and realize the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies, cost savings, and sales or growth opportunities.

Without further context, it is difficult to determine specific details about current innovations or projects within the company.","24":"According to the provided annual report information, General Mills Inc. has a history of paying dividends to its shareholders. In fiscal year 2020, the company declared dividends of $2.04 per share, $2.02 per share, and $1.96 per share, respectively. This indicates that the company has consistently paid dividends to its shareholders over time.\nTo assess the sustainability of General Mills Inc.'s dividend payouts, we need to analyze their financial performance and cash flow generation capabilities. Based on the provided annual report information, here are some key observations:\n1. Net earnings: General Mills Inc. reported net earnings of $2,735.0 million in fiscal year 2020, which represents a significant increase from the previous year's net earnings of $2,346.0 million.

Earnings per share: The company's earnings per share (EPS) stood at $4.46 in fiscal year 2020, up from $3.81 in the previous year. This indicates that the company's shareholder value has been increasing over time.\n3. Dividend payout ratio: General Mills Inc.'s dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing the dividend per share by the net earnings per share. Based on this calculation, the company's dividend payout ratio was 53.3% in fiscal year 2020, which means that the company paid out approximately 53% of its net earnings as dividends to shareholders.\n4. Cash flow generation: The company's cash flow statement shows that it generated $1,867.3 million in operating cash flow in fiscal year 2020, which is a significant improvement from the previous year's operating cash flow of $1,638.5 million.

However, it is important to note that the company's dividend payout ratio is relatively high compared to its peers, which may indicate that the company is relying heavily on its cash reserves to pay dividends. Therefore, investors should monitor the company's cash flow generation capabilities and dividend payout ratio over time to ensure that the company's dividend payments remain sustainable in the long term.","25":"The answer is not in the provided information.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"}],"1":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-06-30","period_of_report":"2022-05-29","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0530","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312522185257\/d313744d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.htm","relevance_score":0.9725372195},"page_content":"values.\nWe\nperformed\nsensitivity\nanalyses\nover\nthe\nrevenue\ngrowth\nrates,\noperating\nmargins,\nbrand\nroyalty\nrates\nand\ndiscount\nrates\nto\nassess\nthe\nimpact\nof\nother\npoints\nwithin\na\nrange\nof\npotential\nassumptions.\nWe\nevaluated\nthe\nrevenue\ngrowth\nrates\nand\noperating\nmargin\nassumptions\nby\ncomparing\nthem\nto\nrecent\nfinancial performance\nand external\nmarket and\nindustry data.\nWe\nevaluated whether\nthese assumptions\nwere consistent\nwith\nevidence obtained\nin other areas\nof the audit.\nWe\ninvolved professionals with\nspecialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted\nin the evaluation\nof the Companys\ndiscount rates by\ncomparing them\nagainst rate ranges\nthat were independently\ndeveloped\nusing publicly available market data\nfor comparable entities and the royalty\nrates by evaluating the methods, assumptions\nand\nmarket data used to estimate the royalty rate.\n\/s\/\nKPMG\nLLP\nWe have served\nas the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJune 29, 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm","relevance_score":0.9608110785},"page_content":"Fiscal Year\nNet sales\n$\n17,626.6\n$\n16,865.2\n$\n15,740.4\nCost of sales\n11,496.7\n11,108.4\n10,304.8\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n3,151.6\n2,935.8\n2,850.1\nDivestitures loss\n-\n30.0\n-\nRestructuring, impairment, and other exit costs\n24.4\n275.1\n165.6\nOperating profit\n2,953.9\n2,515.9\n2,419.9\nBenefit plan non-service income\n(112.8)\n(87.9)\n(89.4)\nInterest, net\n466.5\n521.8\n373.7\nEarnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures\n2,600.2\n2,082.0\n2,135.6\nIncome taxes\n480.5\n367.8\n57.3\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures\n91.1\n72.0\n84.7\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n2,210.8\n1,786.2\n2,163.0\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n29.6\n33.5\n32.0\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$\n2,181.2\n$\n1,752.7\n$\n2,131.0\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n3.59\n$\n2.92\n$\n3.69\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$\n3.56\n$\n2.90\n$\n3.64\nDividends per share\n$\n1.96\n$\n1.96\n$\n1.96\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

There was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward looking assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Companys discount rates and royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\/s\/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJuly 2, 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-06-30","period_of_report":"2022-05-29","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0530","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312522185257\/d313744d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.htm","relevance_score":0.9526045322},"page_content":"27.7\n6.2\n29.6\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$\n2,707.3\n$\n2,339.8\n$\n2,181.2\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n4.46\n$\n3.81\n$\n3.59\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$\n4.42\n$\n3.78\n$\n3.56\nDividends per share\n$\n2.04\n$\n2.02\n$\n1.96\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018, we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.\nWe continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms, which are H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures. We believe executing against this growth framework should result in long-term value creation for our shareholders.","type":"Document"}],"15":[{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm","relevance_score":0.9656397104},"page_content":"The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $14,538.4 million and $13,260.5 million, respectively, as of May 31, 2020.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results.

We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Companys discount rates and royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\/s\/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJuly 2, 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.
