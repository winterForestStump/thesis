This growth can be attributed to several factors, including the company's efforts to optimize its supply chain and reduce costs, as well as the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements.\nHowever, it is important to note that the cash flow generated from operations has been fluctuating over the past few years, with significant variations observed in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. In particular, the cash flow generated from operations in fiscal year 2020 was $6,657 million, which is higher than the amount observed in fiscal year 2021. This may be due to various factors, such as changes in the company's business strategy or economic conditions affecting its operations.\nOverall, while the cash flow generated from operations has shown an increasing trend over the past few years, it is essential to analyze the company's financial performance in more detail to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.","8":"According to the provided text, NIKE invested $4.669 billion in share repurchases during fiscal year 2021, and $650 million in fiscal year 2020 for share repurchases.

This indicates that NIKE's accounts receivable were turned over approximately 1.7 times within one year.\nHowever, a closer examination of the accounts receivable aging reveals some concerns:\n1. The proportion of accounts receivable aged more than 30 days increased from 25% in 2020 to 31% in 2021, indicating a slight increase in slow-paying customers.\n2. The amount of accounts receivable aged between 31 and 60 days increased from $248 million in 2020 to $467 million in 2021, representing a significant increase in moderately slow-paying customers.\n3. The amount of accounts receivable aged between 61 and 90 days increased from $149 million in 2020 to $225 million in 2021, indicating a notable increase in slow-paying customers.\nWhile these increases may be due to various factors such as supply chain disruptions, inventory management issues, or changes in customer payment habits, they could potentially indicate risks related to credit management and collections. It would be essential for NIKE to monitor these trends closely and implement strategies to address them to maintain healthy accounts receivable management practices.","13":"The answer is not in the context. The document provides information about NIKE's policies regarding disclosure of information to securities analysts, risk factors affecting the company's business, and forward-looking statements, but it does not provide information on NIKE's market share or how it has changed over the years.","14":"Based on the provided annual reports, the following companies are listed as NIKE's main competitors:\n* Adidas AG\n\nFrom the provided information, it appears that NIKE differentiates itself through its focus on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services across various categories, including men's, women's, and kids'.

Nike's reliance on a few large customers and distributors makes it vulnerable to disruptions in their business relationships.\n7. The company's operations are affected by factors such as changes in global economic conditions, currency exchange rates, and geopolitical events.\n8. Nike's success is also dependent on its ability to manage its supply chain effectively, including its relationships with suppliers and manufacturers.\n9.

The company takes advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and hedges a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. The implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and the foreign currency adjustment program enhanced the company's ability to manage its foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within its portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Additionally, the company's hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged.\nTherefore, based on the provided information, it appears that NIKE does manage currency risk and takes steps to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on its financials. However, without further information, it is unclear how significant the impact of currency fluctuations is on NIKE's financials or whether the company's hedging efforts are fully effective in mitigating these impacts.","31":"Based on the provided annual reports, NIKE's critical accounting policies include:\n1.
