Additionally, the document states that the Company estimates that year-over-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased pre-tax income by approximately $92 million and $152 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. This suggests that the Company is actively managing currency risk through these instruments and that there are impacts on financials due to currency fluctuations.","31":"According to the document provided, 3M CO's critical accounting policies include:\n1. Measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker: 3M changed the way it measures segment operating performance in 2022, which may affect the disclosed measure of segment profit\/loss (business segment operating income).\n2.

For example, the change in segment operating performance measurement could result in different segment profit\/loss amounts, while the adoption of the new lease accounting standard may lead to increased recognition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and changes in income statement presentation. It is essential for investors and stakeholders to carefully review and understand these changes to accurately assess 3M CO's financial position and performance.","32":"According to the provided document, 3M CO had a pension obligation of $15,948 million and $17,360 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units.

Investing in 3Ms business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Companys primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.

The new standard introduces a lessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods presented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the process of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure requirements, and assessed internal controls impacts. Note 16 provides information regarding rent expense for operating leases and minimum lease payments for capital and operating leases under existing lease guidance. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2016-02, it does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations.
