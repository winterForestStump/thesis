Source: Jabil Inc.'s 2023 10-K Annual Report\",\n          \"The answer is not in the provided information. The document only provides information about Jabil Inc.'s financial performance, operations, and business strategy for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, but does not contain any information about the company's market share or how it has changed over the years.\",\n          \"According to the document provided, JABIL INC has a history of paying dividends to its shareholders. For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, the company paid out $818 million in dividends, representing a payout ratio of 21.6% based on net income. This means that for every dollar of net income, the company paid out $0.216 in dividends. To determine the sustainability of these dividend payouts, we need to analyze the company's cash flow and balance sheet. According to the document, JABIL INC had net revenues of $34.7 billion and net income attributable to Jabil Inc. of $818 million in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. The company also had a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, totaling $4.5 billion, which can be used to fund dividend payments. However, it's important to note that the company also had a significant amount of debt, totaling $4.3 billion, which could impact its ability to sustainably pay dividends in the future. A high level of debt can limit the company's financial flexibility and increase its borrowing costs, making it more difficult to maintain dividend payments. In conclusion, while JABIL INC has a history of paying dividends and has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund these payments, the company's high level of debt may make it challenging to sustainably pay dividends in the future without implementing cost-cutting measures or reducing debt levels.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Llama2-70B response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Based on the information provided in the company's annual report, Jabil Inc. offers its employees various benefits, including:\\n\\n1.
