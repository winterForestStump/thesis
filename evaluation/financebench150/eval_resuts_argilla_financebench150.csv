Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million.

7,8,f8931820-5c0b-4029-a546-fa2bfaafce35,Does 3M maintain a stable trend of dividend distribution?,"['Managing currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\nRaw materials:', ""NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nThe strength and stability of 3Ms business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3Ms business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Companys primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nTotal debt:""]"," Yes, 3M has maintained a stable trend of dividend distribution for 65 consecutive years.

Revenue in FY2019: $7,456 million
Average PP&E = (FY2018 PP&E + FY2019 PP&E) / 2

From the provided data, we have:
FY2018 PP&E = $3,774 million
FY2019 PP&E = $3,651 million

Average PP&E = ($3,774 + $3,651) / 2 = $3,712.5 million

In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which results in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt particularly U.S. dollar and Euro denominated debt. The underlying causes for the continued volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher inflation in many economies, which has resulted in increased volatility in energy and food markets and impacted global economies.

Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021.

Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments, which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past, revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation® 5, Microsoft® XboxTM Series S and Microsoft® XboxTM Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.']"," The revenue change in FY22 for AMD was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue due to higher sales of EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue from semi-custom product sales, and significant growth in Embedded segment revenue from Xilinx embedded product sales.

The net incomes are as follows: FY2015 - $1,233 million, FY2016 - $1,246 million, and FY2017 - $1,228 million. The revenues are: FY2015 - $40,339 million, FY2016 - $39,528 million, and FY2017 - $39,403 million.

For example, capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment.

This family of commercial jet aircraft in production includes the 737 narrow-body model and the 767, 777 and 787 wide-body models. We ended production of the 747 wide-body model in 2022. Development continues on the 777X program and the 737-7 and 737-10 derivatives.\nDefense, Space & Security Segment\nThis segment engages in the research, development, production and modification of manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems for strike, surveillance and mobility, including fighter and trainer aircraft; vertical lift, including rotorcraft and tilt-rotor aircraft; and commercial derivative aircraft, including anti-submarine and tanker aircraft.

61,62,05a59baa-daa3-4ec9-9502-c92d057eb385,Has Boeing reported any materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022?,"['The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based plans expense reflecting a one-time stock grant to most employees in lieu of 2021 salary increases. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect the significant increase in commercial aircraft inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.5 billion in 2021 and $2.2 billion in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, Accounts payable included $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs increased by $0.2 billion in 2022 and declined by $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in 2021 and 2020. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines in 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers.', 'In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18 Super Hornet, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Pegasus Tanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final FY19 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2018, 31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government.

During 2021, we delivered 14 aircraft between March and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021 due to production quality issues including in our supply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had approximately 100 and 110 aircraft in inventory. Most of the aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2022 are expected to deliver by the end of 2024.\nWe are currently producing at low rates and expect to gradually return to 5 per month in 2023. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At December 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes.', 'In addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022.

The operating income is given as $2,112 million in FY2019, $509 million in FY2020, and $1,306 million in FY2021.

Total operating income = 2,112 + 509 + 1,306 = 3,927 million

Now we can calculate the average unadjusted operating income % margin:

Average unadjusted operating income % margin = (Total operating income / Total net sales) * 100
= (3,927 / (14,189 + 14,082 + 11,303)) * 100
= (3,927 / 39,574) * 100
= 0.099 * 100

This fluctuation suggests that gross margins may not have been consistently stable over the years, but without specific historical data on gross margins, it's impossible to confirm this with certainty.

Gross margin is a relevant metric for companies like JPMorgan Chase as it measures their profitability by showing how much of each dollar in revenue translates into gross profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold (COGS). It helps assess the efficiency and effectiveness of a company's production process, pricing strategy, and overall financial health.

To find the average total assets, we need to calculate the sum of the total assets at the end of FY2019 and FY2020 and divide by 2. The total assets for FY2019 are $50,710 million (from Balance Sheet) and for FY2020 they are $50,873 million (from Balance Sheet).

Average Total Assets = ($50,710 + $50,873) / 2 = $50,791.5 million

This calculation was based on the reported revenues of $9,654 million in FY2020 and $9,837 million in FY2022.

Here's how you can calculate it:

CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1

Where n is the number of years. In this case, n=2.

CAGR = ($9,837 million / $9,654 million)^(1/2) - 1
CAGR = (1.0211)^(0.5) - 1
CAGR = 1.0100 - 1
CAGR = 0.01 or 1% when rounded to one decimal place.

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $887 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations discussed within the Results of Operations section above, and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments.\nInvesting activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts.

Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

111,112,f26a0a26-1472-4aac-bff7-2961edf06643,Has Microsoft increased its debt on balance sheet between FY2023 and the FY2022 period?,"['Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.', 'We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices.

These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.\nThe total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:\nFLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate\nExpected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 %\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nCost of sales $ 33 $ 29 $ 30\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 347 208 239\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense 31 10 20\nTotal restructuring and impairment charges $ 411 $ 247 $ 289\nAfter-tax amount $ 334 $ 206 $ 231\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ (0.24) $ (0.15) $ (0.17)\n2022 2021 2020 Plan to Date\nthrough 12/31/2022\nFLNA $ 46 $ 28 $ 83 $ 210\nQFNA 7 - 5 19\nPBNA 68 20 47 226\nLatAm 32 37 31 171\nEurope 109 81 48 343\nAMESA 12 15 14 82\nAPAC 16 7 5 77\nCorporate 90 49 36 229\n380 237 269 1,357', 'Assumption Amount\nDiscount rates used in the calculation of expense\n$ 13\nExpected rate of return $ 38\nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.\nWe made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make an additional $125 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nOur pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.

From the provided data, we can see that the gain associated with the Juice Transaction was $(3,322) million in FY2022. Therefore, the unadjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows:

Unadjusted EBITDA = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization - Gain from Juice Transaction
Unadjusted EBITDA = $1,944 million + ($7,229 million - $3,322 million)
Unadjusted EBITDA = $16,598 million.

As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.\nPFIZER INC.

As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.\nPFIZER INC.

Similarly, we offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Colourpop, Juvias Place, Chanel and Florence.

Some of our prestige brand partners may not have the capacity to supply us with sufficient merchandise to keep pace with our growth plans. We also have strategic partnerships with certain core brands, which have allowed us to benefit from the growing popularity of such brands. Any of our other core brands could in the future decide to scale back or end its partnership with us and strengthen its relationship with our competitors, which could negatively impact the revenue we earn from the sale of such products. If we fail to maintain strong relationships with our existing brand partners, or if we fail to continue acquiring and strengthening relationships with additional brand partners of beauty products, our ability to obtain a sufficient amount and variety of merchandise on reasonable terms may be limited, which could have a negative impact on our competitive position.\nDuring fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, merchandise supplied to Ulta Beauty by our top ten brand partners accounted for approximately 56% and 54% of our net sales, respectively.

Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.","['Gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 24 basis points for fiscal 2017, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. For fiscal 2017, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points for fiscal 2017, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million and $249 million, respectively. For fiscal 2017, the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the investment in the associate wage structure; the charge related to discontinued real estate projects; and investments in digital retail and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, respectively.\nWalmart International Segment\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\nNet sales\n$\n118,068\n$\n116,119\n$\n123,408\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.7\n%\n(5.9\n)%\n(9.4\n)%\nOperating income\n$\n5,352\n$\n5,758\n$\n5,346\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales\n4.5\n%\n5.0\n%\n4.3\n%\nUnit counts at period end\n6,360\n6,363\n6,299\nRetail square feet at period end', ')\n-\n(8,204\n)\nCash dividend declared to noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(687\n)\n(687\n)\nOther\n-\n(10\n)\n-\nBalances as of January 31, 2018\n2,952\n$\n$\n2,648\n$\n85,107\n$\n(10,181\n)\n$\n77,869\n$\n2,953\n$\n80,822\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nConsolidated net income\n$\n10,523\n$\n14,293\n$\n15,080\nAdjustments to reconcile consolidated net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n10,529\n10,080\n9,454\nDeferred income taxes\n(304\n)\n(672\n)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n3,136\n-\n-\nOther operating activities\n1,210\n1,410\nChanges in certain assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions:\nReceivables, net\n(1,074\n)\n(402\n)\n(19\n)\nInventories\n(140\n)\n1,021\n(703\n)\nAccounts payable\n4,086\n3,942\n2,008\nAccrued liabilities\n1,280\n1,466\nAccrued income taxes\n(557\n)\n(472\n)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n28,337\n31,673\n27,552\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,051\n)\n(10,619\n)\n(11,477\n)\nProceeds from the disposal of property and equipment\nProceeds from the disposal of certain operations\n1,046\nPurchase of available for sale securities\n-\n(1,901\n)\n-\nBusiness acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(375\n)\n(2,463\n)\n-\nOther investing activities\n(58\n)\n(122\n)\n(79\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(9,060\n)\n(13,987\n)\n(10,675\n)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nNet change in short-term borrowings\n4,148\n(1,673\n)\n1,235\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n7,476\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(13,061\n)\n(2,055\n)\n(4,432\n)\nPremiums paid to extinguish debt\n(3,059\n)\n-\n-\nDividends paid\n(6,124\n)\n(6,216\n)\n(6,294\n)\nPurchase of Company stock\n(8,296\n)\n(8,298\n)\n(4,112\n)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interest\n(690\n)\n(479\n)\n(719\n)\nPurchase of noncontrolling interest\n(8\n)\n(90\n)\n(1,326\n)\nOther financing activities\n(261\n)\n(398\n)\n(676\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(19,875\n)\n(19,072\n)']", The change in unadjusted operating income % margin for Walmart from FY2017 to FY2018 is an increase of 4.3%.
