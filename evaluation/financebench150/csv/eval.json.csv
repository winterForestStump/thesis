0,Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the balance sheet: what is the year end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M? Answer in USD billions., The year-end FY2018 net PPNE for 3M is $10.46 billion USD.,"['0.02\n0.50\n-\nCurrent period, excluding MN Natural Resource Damages (NRD) resolution and TCJA measurement period adjustment\n$\n2.31\n$\n10.46\n$\n9.17\nTCJA measurement period adjustment\n0.07\n(0.29)\n(1.24)\nMN NRD resolution\n(0.11)\n(1.28)\n-\nCurrent period\n$\n2.27\n$\n8.89\n$\n7.93\n\t\t\nYear 2018 and fourth quarter EPS:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2018, net income attributable to 3M was $1.347 billion, or $2.27 per diluted share, compared to $523 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 167 percent on a per diluted share basis. Adjusting for the impacts related to the resolution of the Minnesota natural resource damages (NRD) matter and accounting for the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as further described in the Operating income, operating income margin, income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and effective tax rate adjusted for impacts of the Minnesota NRD resolution and the measurement period adjustment to the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) - (non-GAAP measures) section below, net income attributable to 3M was $1.366 billion, or $2.31 diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $1.285 billion, or $2.10 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 10.0 percent on a per diluted share basis.\nFor full year 2018, net income attributable to 3M was $5.349 billion, or $8.89 per diluted share basis, compared to $4.858 billion, or $7.93 per diluted share, for full year 2017, an increase of 12.1 percent on a per diluted share. Adjusting for the NRD matter and the TCJA as described further below, net income was $6.295 billion, or $10.46 per diluted share for the full year 2018, compared to $5.620 billion, or $9.17 per diluted share for full year 2017, an increase of 14.1 percent on a per diluted share basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.', 'Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\nAt December 31, 2022, 3M had $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.7 billion was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.2 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2021, 3M had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and $1.7 billion was held by the United States. The decrease from December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from cash flow from operations and Food Safety transaction-related cash consideration and earlier borrowings (see Note 3) offset by ongoing dividend payments, purchases of treasury stock, capital expenditures, and the fixed-rate medium-term note maturities in 2022.\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position.

The generated answer does not contain the ground truth as it discusses 3M's net PPNE for FY2018, while the ground truth is about Adobe's operating margins decline from FY2021 to FY2022."
1,Is 3M a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data?," Based on FY2022 data, it is not possible to determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business solely from the provided context. The information given focuses more on balance sheet details and debt management rather than specific capital intensity metrics. However, the strong balance sheet and liquidity suggest that the company may have significant investments in assets which could indicate capital intensity. For a definitive answer, additional data related to capital expenditures or fixed asset values would be needed.","['Net debt (non-GAAP measure) $ 12,023 $ 12,571 $ (548)\nRefer to the preceding Total Debt and Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities sections for additional details.\nBalance Sheet:\n3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure):\nDecember 31,\n(Millions) 2022 2021 Change\nCurrent assets $ 14,688 $ 15,403 $ (715)\nLess: Current liabilities 9,523 9,035 488\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure) $ 5,165 $ 6,368 $ (1,203)\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $1.2 billion compared with December 31, 2021. Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.', ""Total debt:\nThe strength of 3Ms credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Companys debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Companys total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBORs administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.""]","000L3s0 (2 solar000 in this

4,"Does Adobe have an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why."," Based on the provided information, it is not possible to determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022. The data does not directly provide the operating margin figures for comparison over multiple years. However, we can observe that there was a decrease in non-operating income (expense) from $19 million in 2022 to $16 million in 2021 and an increase in net income from $4,822 million in 2021 to $5,260 million in 2022. This suggests that Adobe's overall profitability may have improved during this period, but without the operating margin figures, we cannot definitively say if it has an improving profile.

The data given focuses more on operating activities, investing activities, and derivative instruments rather than free cash flow conversion specifically for Adobe in FY2022.

However, it's worth noting that the net cash provided by operating activities has increased from $5,727 million in FY2021 to $7,838 million in FY2022. This could potentially indicate an improvement in Adobe's ability to generate positive cash flow from its core operations during this period. But without specific information on free cash flow conversion for Adobe in FY2022, we cannot definitively conclude that there has been an improvement."," Yes, the generated answer contains information that does not directly confirm or deny the presence of specific data about Adobe's Free Cash Flow Conversion as of FY2022, which aligns with a score of '0'. However, it correctly implies there is no direct evidence provided in the context.

14,"What drove operating margin change as of the FY22 for AMD? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why."," The operating margin change for AMD as of FY22 was driven by factors such as lower game console royalties, decreased net revenue, and reduced gross margins in the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment due to increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products. If operating margin is not a useful metric for AMD, it may be because the company's business model involves significant investments in research and development (R&D) which can impact profitability but are essential for long-term growth and innovation. Additionally, fluctuations in market demand and competition could also make operating margin less reliable as a consistent measure of performance.","['and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above.', 'Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses of $947 million in 2015 decreased by $125 million, or 12%, compared to $1.1 billion in 2014.

The answer does not directly reference or use any facts provided in the set. While it discusses a relevant financial metric (operating margin), there is no direct grounding in the given facts about Amex's employment numbers, stock exchange details, ROE calculation, net interest yield on loans, business environment, etc., for 2022.

However, if we consider that not having specific data does not necessarily mean it cannot be inferred or discussed generally (though this is a grey area), the answer could potentially still be seen as somewhat grounded in the context of financial analysis and performance metrics, but strictly speaking based on the provided facts, there's no direct support.

Therefore, I would give a 'no' score because it doesn't directly use or reference any specific fact from the given set to discuss Amex's operating margin profile for 2022. The answer could be seen as indirectly related but not explicitly grounded in the provided facts. It is important to note that this interpretation might vary depending on how strictly one interprets ""grounding"" in the context of these instructions.

Susan Hardwick). These details are directly referenced from the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by the company. Therefore, the answer is grounded in these facts as it relates to information about equity compensation plans and their incorporation into official financial documents of American Water Works Company, Inc."," No
- The generated answer does not contain or equal to the ground truth as it discusses American Water Works Company and working capital without mentioning anything about 3M's dividend history.

18,"In agreement with the information outlined in the income statement, what is the FY2015 - FY2017 3 year average net profit margin (as a %) for Best Buy? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place."," The three-year average net profit margin for Best Buy from FY2015 to FY2017 is approximately 3.6%. (rounded to one decimal place)
Explanation: To calculate the three-year average net profit margin, we first need to find the net income for each year and then divide it by the revenue for that same year. The net incomes are as follows: FY2015 - $1,233 million, FY2016 - $1,246 million, and FY2017 - $1,228 million. The revenues are: FY2015 - $40,339 million, FY2016 - $39,528 million, and FY2017 - $39,403 million. Now we calculate the net profit margins for each year: FY2015 - 3.07%, FY2016 - 3.18%, and FY2017 - 3.12%.

The provided answer does not directly reference the facts given but correctly states that specific details about major acquisitions in FY2023, FY2022, and FY2021 are not included in the context. However, it should be noted that this response is based on the absence of information rather than a direct grounding in the provided facts.

If we were to assess whether the answer was supported by the given facts (even though they don't directly mention FY2023-FY2021 acquisitions), it could be argued that there is an implied understanding from the context of previous acquisition activities, such as the one with GreatCall Inc. in 2018, which might suggest a pattern or strategy for future acquisitions. However, this would still not constitute direct evidence supporting specifics about FY2023-FY2021 acquisitions.

Therefore, strictly speaking based on the provided facts, the answer is 'no' because it does not directly reference any of them but rather makes an inference that isn't explicitly supported by the given information."," No

The answer is grounded in the facts provided as it accurately refers to and interprets data from the 'Selected Online Revenue Data' section of the given set of facts. The increase in online revenue as a percentage of total segment revenue supports the claim about Best Buy category's top line performance during this period. However, while the answer correctly uses the provided information, it does not mention all relevant data points (comparable sales growth and restructuring charges) that could provide more context to the situation. Nonetheless, based on the given facts, the statement is factually accurate. Therefore, a 'yes' score is appropriate.
This answer would be even better if it also mentioned comparable sales growth and restructuring charges as these factors can influence top line performance too. But for the purpose of this task, since the provided information supports the claim made in the answer, we give a 'yes'."," No

The generated answer does not contain the ground truth as it discusses Best Buy's online sales revenue growth, while the ground truth pertains to Adobe's operating margins decline."
23,Has Boeing reported any materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022?, I don't have information on materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022 for Boeing based on the provided context.,"['The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based plans expense reflecting a one-time stock grant to most employees in lieu of 2021 salary increases. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect the significant increase in commercial aircraft inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.5 billion in 2021 and $2.2 billion in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, Accounts payable included $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs increased by $0.2 billion in 2022 and declined by $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in 2021 and 2020. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines in 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers.', 'In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies (including NASA) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the House and Senate Appropriations Committees included funding for Boeings major programs, such as F/A-18 Super Hornet, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Pegasus Tanker and P-8 Poseidon, in their final FY19 defense appropriations, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY20 and beyond will affect Boeings programs. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows.\nIn addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both U.S. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the U.S. DoD to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. If we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the U.S. DoD customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.\nIn 2018, 31% of our revenues were earned pursuant to U.S. government contracts, which include foreign military sales (FMS) through the U.S. government.

The information about potential impacts due to future budget cuts or investment priority changes, as well as the uncertainty with respect to U.S. defense spending levels and threat environment is present in the context but it doesn't directly answer the question asked. The provided facts do not support this specific claim. Therefore, based on these facts, we cannot confirm if there were any materially important legal battles for Boeing from FY2022.
The correct response should be 'no'. This is because none of the given facts specifically mention or provide information about ""materially important ongoing legal battles from FY2022"" for Boeing. The context does discuss various financial and operational aspects, but it doesn't directly address this specific query.

- The generated answer does not contain or equal to the ground truth as it discusses Boeing and legal battles from FY2022 while the ground truth is about 3M's dividends.
- There seems to be a mismatch in both context and content between the provided answer and the ground truth. The correct response should have been related to 3M's consistent increase in per share dividend over 65 years, not Boeing or legal battles from FY2022.
- Therefore, based on these observations, the generated answer does not match with the provided ground truth. Hence, the binary score is 'no'."
24,What is Coca Cola's FY2022 dividend payout ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders)? Round answer to two decimal places. Answer the question asked by assuming you only have access to information clearly displayed in the cash flow statement and the income statement.," The dividend payout ratio for Coca Cola's FY2022 is calculated as the total cash dividends paid divided by net income attributable to shareholders. From the provided information, we have:

Total cash dividends paid = $7,617 million (in 2022)
Net income attributable to shareholders = $9,542 million (in 2022)

Dividend payout ratio = Total cash dividends paid / Net income attributable to shareholders
= 7,617 / 9,542
= 0.8

So, the dividend payout ratio for Coca Cola's FY2022 is approximately 0.8 or 80%.","['- 19 -\nNet income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company 9,542 9,771 7,747\nDividends (per share - $1.76, $1.68 and $1.64 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n(7,617) (7,251) (7,047)\nBalance at end of year 71,019 69,094 66,555\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nBalance at beginning of year (14,330) (14,601) (13,544)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (565) 271 (1,057)\nBalance at end of year (14,895) (14,330) (14,601)\nTreasury Stock\nBalance at beginning of year (51,641) (52,016) (52,244)\nTreasury stock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 376 375 228\nPurchases of stock for treasury (1,336) - -\nBalance at end of year (52,601) (51,641) (52,016)\nTotal Equity Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company $ 24,105 $ 22,999 $ 19,299\nEquity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nBalance at beginning of year $ 1,861 $ 1,985 $ 2,117\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 29 33 21\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments (118) (132) (153)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interests (51) (43) (18)\nContributions by noncontrolling interests - 20 17\nOther activities - (2) 1\nTotal Equity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests $ 1,721 $ 1,861 $ 1,985\n1 Represents the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2021.\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business', 'Dividends (7,616) (7,252) (7,047)\nOther financing activities (1,095) (353) 310\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities (10,250) (6,786) (8,070)\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and\nRestricted Cash Equivalents (205) (159) 76\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash\nequivalents during the year (200) 2,915 373\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of year 10,025 7,110 6,737\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents at End of Year 9,825 10,025 7,110\nLess: Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at end of year 306 341 315\nCash and Cash Equivalents at End of Year $ 9,519 $ 9,684 $ 6,795\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREOWNERS EQUITY\n(In millions except per share data)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nEquity Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company\nNumber of Common Shares Outstanding\nBalance at beginning of year 4,325 4,302 4,280\nTreasury stock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 24 23 22\nPurchases of stock for treasury (21) - -\nBalance at end of year 4,328 4,325 4,302\nCommon Stock $ 1,760 $ 1,760 $ 1,760\nCapital Surplus\nBalance at beginning of year 18,116 17,601 17,154\nStock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 373 216 307\nStock-based compensation expense 332 299 141\nOther activities 1 - (1)\nBalance at end of year 18,822 18,116 17,601\nReinvested Earnings\nBalance at beginning of year 69,094 66,555 65,855\nAdoption of accounting standards1\n- 19 -\nNet income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company 9,542 9,771 7,747\nDividends (per share - $1.76, $1.68 and $1.64 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n(7,617) (7,251) (7,047)']",003200000000020)00011)03000)0a0006350004607822223) 10330002055icauilotias2220555aes 0000000000000005550a)646000055a09552," Yes.

26,"Taking into account the information outlined in the income statement, what is the FY2019 - FY2021 3 year average unadjusted operating income % margin for Corning? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place."," To calculate the FY2019-FY2021 3-year average unadjusted operating income % margin, we first need to find the total net sales and gross margins for each year. Then, we can use these values to calculate the operating income percentage for each year and finally compute the average over the three years.

Net Sales:
FY2019: $14,189 million
FY2020: $14,082 million
FY2021: $11,303 million

Gross Margin:
FY2019: $5,063 million
FY2020: $5,063 million

34333osedaringe333"," Yes, the answer is grounded in / supported by a set of facts. The calculation for the 3-year average unadjusted operating income % margin requires finding the total net sales and gross margins for each year as mentioned in the provided data. However, we need the operating expenses to calculate the operating income (OI) for FY2019 and FY2020, which are not directly given but can be derived from the net income figures by adding back non-operating items such as interest income/expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, etc.

Here's a step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate Operating Income (OI) for FY2019 and FY2021 using the net income figures provided in the notes section by adding back non-operating items such as interest expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, etc.:
   - OI for FY2019 = Net Income + Interest Expense (interest income) + Amortization of Purchased Intangibles

29,What is the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2018 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018). Round your answer to two decimal places. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the balance sheet.," The FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for CVS Health is calculated as follows:

FY2018 revenue = Net income attributable to CVS Health / Weighted average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018
Weighted average PP&E (FY2017) = ($9,408 + $3,117 + $24,431 + $3,117) / 2 = $15,639 million
Weighted average PP&E (FY2018) = ($9,408 + $2,778 + $27,276 + $1,909 + $2,685 + $12,873) / 6 = $10,791 million

However, we can observe that their total assets increased from $232,999 million in 2021 to $228,275 million in 2022, and the company's inventories also decreased slightly during this period. The depreciation and amortization expense was $4,247 million in 2022, which is a significant portion of their net income ($4,165 million). These factors suggest that CVS Health may have substantial capital investments, but further analysis would be needed to confirm if it's considered capital-intensive.","['Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the beginning of the period 12,691 11,043 8,408\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at the end of the period $ 13,305 $ 12,691 $ 11,043\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nIn millions 2022 2021 2020\nReconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nNet income $ 4,165 $ 7,898 $ 7,192\nAdjustments required to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization 4,247 4,512 4,441\nLoss on assets held for sale 2,533 - -\nStore impairments - 1,358 -\nGoodwill impairment - 431 -\nStock-based compensation 447 484 400\nGain on sale of subsidiaries (475) - (269)\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt - 452 1,440\nDeferred income taxes (2,075) (428) (570)\nOther noncash items 332 (390) 72\nChange in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects from acquisitions:\nAccounts receivable, net (2,971) (2,703) (1,510)\nInventories (1,435) 735 (973)\nOther assets (566) (3) 364\nAccounts payable and pharmacy claims and discounts payable 4,260 2,898 2,769\nHealth care costs payable and other insurance liabilities 1,247 169 (231)\nOther liabilities 6,468 2,852 2,740\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 16,177 $ 18,265 $ 15,865\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity\nAttributable to CVS Health\nNumber of shares\noutstanding Common\nStock and\nCapital\nSurplus (2)\nAccumulated\nOther\nComprehensive\nIncome (Loss) Total\nCVS Health\nShareholders\nEquity Total\nShareholders\nEquity\nIn millions Common\nShares Treasury\nShares (1)\nTreasury\nStock (1)\nRetained\nEarnings Noncontrolling\nInterests\nBalance at December 31, 2019 1,727 (425) $ 45,972 $ (28,235) $ 45,108 $ 1,019 $ 63,864 $ 306 $ 64,170\nAdoption of new accounting standard (3)\n- - - - (3) - (3) - (3)\nNet income - - - - 7,179 - 7,179 13 7,192', 'Inventories 19,090 17,760\nAssets held for sale 908 -\nOther current assets 2,685 5,292\nTotal current assets 65,682 60,008\nLong-term investments 21,096 23,025\nProperty and equipment, net 12,873 12,896\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 17,872 19,122\nGoodwill 78,150 79,121\nIntangible assets, net 24,754 29,026\nSeparate accounts assets 3,228 5,087\nOther assets 4,620 4,714\nTotal assets $ 228,275 $ 232,999\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 14,838 $ 12,544\nPharmacy claims and discounts payable 19,423 17,330\nHealth care costs payable 10,406 8,808\nPolicyholders funds 1,500 4,301\nAccrued expenses 18,745 17,670\nOther insurance liabilities 1,140 1,303\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 1,678 1,646\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 1,778 4,205\nLiabilities held for sale 228 -\nTotal current liabilities 69,736 67,807\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 16,800 18,177\nLong-term debt 50,476 51,971\nDeferred income taxes 3,880 6,270\nSeparate accounts liabilities 3,228 5,087\nOther long-term insurance liabilities 6,108 6,402\nOther long-term liabilities 6,732 1,904\nTotal liabilities 156,960 157,618\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nShareholders equity:\nPreferred stock, par value $0.01: 0.1 shares authorized; none issued or outstanding\n- -\nCommon stock, par value $0.01: 3,200 shares authorized; 1,758 shares issued and 1,300 shares outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 1,744 shares issued and 1,322 shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and capital surplus\n48,193 47,377\nTreasury stock, at cost: 458 and 422 shares at December 31, 2022 and 2021\n(31,858) (28,173)\nRetained earnings 56,145 54,906\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1,465) 965\nTotal CVS Health shareholders equity 71,015 75,075\nNoncontrolling interests 300 306\nTotal shareholders equity 71,315 75,381\nTotal liabilities and shareholders equity $ 228,275 $ 232,999\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows']","3483.5

The Company is appealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be paid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal settlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions.

Utilization remained below historical levels through April 2020, began to recover in May and June 2020 and reached more normal levels in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, with select geographies impacted by COVID-19 waves. In response to COVID-19, the Company provided expanded benefit coverage to its members, including cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 related treatments, as well as assistance to members through premium credits, telehealth cost-sharing waivers and other investments. During 2020, COVID-19 also resulted in a shift in the Companys medical membership. The Company experienced declines in Commercial membership due to reductions in workforce at our existing customers, substantially offset by increases in Medicaid membership primarily as a result of the suspension of eligibility redeterminations and increased unemployment.']"," ""yes or no (Yes/no for answering yes or not relevant to the following: Yesno.

If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why."," Based on the provided context, it's difficult to determine if JPMorgan Chase's gross margins are historically consistent with a fluctuation of roughly 2% each year. The information given does not directly provide historical data on gross margins or their consistency over time. However, we can see that the net interest income (NII) has experienced significant changes from $39.9 billion in 2022 to $165.91 billion in 2021 and a decrease to $145.01 billion in 2022. This fluctuation suggests that gross margins may not have been consistently stable over the years, but without specific historical data on gross margins, it's impossible to confirm this with certainty.

Gross margin is a relevant metric for companies like JPMorgan Chase as it measures their profitability by showing how much of each dollar in revenue translates into gross profit after accounting for the cost of goods sold (COGS).

===<|assistant|> The provided facts do not directly support or refute the claim about JPMorgan Chase's gross margins being historically consistent with fluctuations of roughly 2% each year. While there is information regarding net interest income (NII) and other financial metrics, specific historical data on gross margins is not provided in the given facts.
    Therefore, based on the available information, we cannot determine if JPMorgan Chase's gross margins are historically consistent with a fluctuation of roughly 2% each year."," No. The generated answer does not contain or equal to the ground truth provided (which is ""0""). There seems to be a misunderstanding as there's no ground truth given in your instruction for comparison. However, based on the context you provided, it appears that the generated answer discusses gross margins and net interest income but doesn't directly address whether JPMorgan Chase's gross margins are historically consistent with fluctuations of roughly 2% each year. To properly assess consistency, specific historical data on gross margins would be needed."

The relevant facts are: ['Income (loss) before income taxes 903,799', 'Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized 594,954']. These figures can be used to calculate the interest coverage ratio using FY2022 Adjusted EBITDAR as the numerator and annual Interest Expense as the denominator. However, it is mentioned that necessary data for calculating this ratio is not available in the given information. Therefore, while the answer refers to specific figures from the provided facts, it correctly states that these are insufficient for determining the interest coverage ratio."," No
- explanation: The generated answer and the ground truth are discussing different financial metrics for two separate companies (MGM Resorts International and Adobe). Therefore, they do not contain or equal to each other's information. The provided context does not allow us to determine MGM Resorts International's interest coverage ratio, while the ground truth talks about a decline in operating margins for Adobe. These are two distinct pieces of financial data and cannot be considered equivalent.

42,Which region had the worst topline performance for MGM during FY2022?," The region with the worst topline performance for MGM during FY2022 was MGM China, as it reported a loss of $193.8 million in Adjusted EBITDAR.","['Corporate and other\nCorporate and other revenue in the current year includes revenues from LeoVegas, other corporate operations, and management services. In the prior year periods, corporate and other revenue also included reimbursed costs revenue related to our CityCenter management agreement (which was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021).\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR\nThe following table presents Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments. See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and\nReportable Segment GAAP measure below for additional information. Adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure, discussed within Non-GAAP measures below.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In thousands)\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts $ 3,142,308 $ 1,738,211 $ 232,188\nRegional Operations 1,294,630 1,217,814 343,990\nMGM China (203,136) 25,367 (193,832)\nCorporate and other (736,548) (560,309) (530,843)\nAdjusted EBITDAR $ 3,497,254\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $3.1 billion in 2022 compared to $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 81%. Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin increased to 37.4% in 2022 compared to 36.7% in 2021. The current year benefited from the increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in contribution from lower-margin non-gaming outlets and venues and promotional activities.\nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $1.3 billion in 2022 compared to $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase of 6%. Regional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin decreased to 33.9% in 2022 compared to 35.9% in 2021. The margin decrease was due primarily to an increase in contribution from lower margin non-gaming outlets and venues.\nMGM China', 'In February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.\nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); win or hold percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts): hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (ADR, a price indicator); and revenue per available room (REVPAR, a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of property closures due to the pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.\nAdditional key performance indicators at MGM China are:']","lyaocres in the information, and:s Nopproprioted:qdar Answerion:s: for:

The answer is grounded in the facts provided as it accurately refers to specific figures from the consolidated statements of cash flows for Nike in FY2023, including net cash flow amounts and categories (operating activities, investing activities, financing activities). The statement correctly identifies that among these three categories, investing activities resulted in a net cash outflow. However, it should be noted that the term ""most"" could potentially imply an absolute value comparison which isn't directly addressed here but is generally understood from context. Therefore, based on the information given and its relevance to the facts provided, this answer can be considered as grounded in/supported by a set of facts.

46,"Does Paypal have positive working capital based on FY2022 data? If working capital is not a useful or relevant metric for this company, then please state that and explain why."," Based on FY2022 data, PayPal has a positive working capital with approximately 90.7% of merchant loans, advances, and interest receivable current (less than 90 days outstanding). However, it's important to note that while this metric can provide insights into the company's short-term liquidity position, it may not fully capture its overall financial health or long-term stability. Working capital is just one aspect of a company's financial analysis and should be considered alongside other metrics for a comprehensive understanding.","['We offer access to merchant finance products for certain small and medium-sized businesses through the PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loan products, which we collectively refer to as our merchant finance offerings. The PayPal Working Capital product allows businesses to access a loan or cash advance for a fixed fee and based on their annual payment volume processed by PayPal. The PayPal Business Loan product provides businesses with short-term financing for a fixed fee based on an evaluation of both the applying business as well as the business owner. In the United States (U.S.), these products are provided under a program agreement with an independent chartered financial institution. We believe that our merchant finance offerings enable us to deepen our engagement with our existing small and medium-sized merchants and expand services to new merchants by providing access to capital that may not be available from traditional banks or other lending providers.\nWe generate revenues from merchants primarily by charging fees for completing their payment transactions and other payment-related services. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our merchant loans receivables.\nConsumer value proposition\nWe focus on providing affordable, convenient, and secure consumer financial products and services intended to democratize the management and movement of money. We provide consumers with a digital wallet that enables them to send payments to merchants more safely using a variety of funding sources, which may include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance, our consumer credit products, a credit card, a debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value products such as gift cards, and eligible rewards.

Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December 31, 2022 was $2.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, representing a year-over-year increase of 48%. The increase in merchant loans, advances and interest and fees receivable outstanding was due primarily to growth in our PayPal Business Loan products in the U.S. Approximately 86% and 5% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., as compared to approximately 82% and 8% as of December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable current 90.7 % 91.8 %\nPercent of merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable > 90 days outstanding(1)\n3.7 % 3.1 %\nNet charge-off rate (2)\n4.5 % 4.7 %\n(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the original expected or contractual repayment period, as applicable.']","cash information.

This fact supports the statement in the answer about PayPal's positive working capital with approximately 90.7% of merchant loans, advances, and interest receivable current (less than 90 days outstanding) based on FY2022 data.

However, it is worth noting that while this fact supports the statement in the answer about PayPal's working capital position for FY2022, the provided facts do not explicitly mention the percentage of merchant loans, advances, and interest receivable current (less than 90 days outstanding) as being approximately 90.7%.

- response: The generated answer does not contain or equal to the ground truth information about 3M's consistent increase in per share dividends over 65 years.

47,What is the FY2021 capital expenditure amount (in USD billions) for PepsiCo? Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of cash flows.," Based on the provided information from PepsiCo's statement of cash flows for FY2021, there is no direct data available to determine the exact capital expenditure amount in USD billions.

"," Yes, the answer is grounded in / supported by the set of facts provided.

The given facts mention that purchases of investments were $6,030 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059 million in 2021. The answer infers that these activities primarily represent cash flows related to capital expenditures for marketable securities and short-term investments. Although the exact amount cannot be determined based on this information alone, it is reasonable to infer a range within which the capital expenditure might fall. Therefore, the provided answer is supported by the facts given in the statement of cash flows."," No. The generated answer does not contain or equal the ground truth, as they discuss different financial aspects of PepsiCo and Adobe respectively.
<|assistant|> Yes. The provided answer accurately reflects the information given in the ground truth about Adobe's operating margins decline from FY2021 to FY2022. However, it does not directly address or contain the specific details mentioned in the ground truth (the exact percentage drop and year).
<|assistant|> No. The generated answer discusses PepsiCo's capital expenditures while the ground truth pertains to Adobe's operating margins. They are unrelated topics within financial analysis."
48,What is the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo? Define unadjusted EBITDA as unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization [from cash flow statement]. Answer in USD millions. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of cash flows and the income statement.," The FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for PepsiCo is $4,876 million. This calculation is based on the net income attributable to shareholders of The Coca-Cola Company ($9,542 million) and adding back depreciation and amortization (calculated as 10% of net income), capex ($3,087 million), and subtracting dividends paid out ($7,616 million).

Here's the breakdown:
- Net Income attributable to shareholders = $9,542 million
- Depreciation & Amortization (10% of net income) = 0.1 * $9,542 million = $954.2 million
- Capex = $3,087 million
- Dividends paid out = -$7,616 million

Unadjusted EBITDA less capex = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capex - Dividends
= $9,542 million + $954.2 million","['Dividends (7,616) (7,252) (7,047)\nOther financing activities (1,095) (353) 310\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities (10,250) (6,786) (8,070)\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and\nRestricted Cash Equivalents (205) (159) 76\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash\nequivalents during the year (200) 2,915 373\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at beginning of year 10,025 7,110 6,737\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents at End of Year 9,825 10,025 7,110\nLess: Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents at end of year 306 341 315\nCash and Cash Equivalents at End of Year $ 9,519 $ 9,684 $ 6,795\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREOWNERS EQUITY\n(In millions except per share data)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nEquity Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company\nNumber of Common Shares Outstanding\nBalance at beginning of year 4,325 4,302 4,280\nTreasury stock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 24 23 22\nPurchases of stock for treasury (21) - -\nBalance at end of year 4,328 4,325 4,302\nCommon Stock $ 1,760 $ 1,760 $ 1,760\nCapital Surplus\nBalance at beginning of year 18,116 17,601 17,154\nStock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 373 216 307\nStock-based compensation expense 332 299 141\nOther activities 1 - (1)\nBalance at end of year 18,822 18,116 17,601\nReinvested Earnings\nBalance at beginning of year 69,094 66,555 65,855\nAdoption of accounting standards1\n- 19 -\nNet income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company 9,542 9,771 7,747\nDividends (per share - $1.76, $1.68 and $1.64 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n(7,617) (7,251) (7,047)', 'Reclassification adjustments recognized in net income 104 (26) 78\nNet change in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities3\n$ 524 $ (116) $ 408\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola\nCompany $ (13) $ (552) $ (565)\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nTranslation adjustments arising during the year $ 263 $ 19 $ 282\nReclassification adjustments recognized in net income 257 - 257\nGains (losses) on intra-entity transactions that are of a long-term investment nature (1,798) - (1,798)\nGains (losses) on net investment hedges arising during the year1\n918 (230) 688\nReclassification adjustments for net investment hedges recognized in net income 4 - 4\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments $ (356) $ (211) $ (567)\nDerivatives:\nGains (losses) arising during the year $ 160 $ (41) $ 119\nReclassification adjustments recognized in net income 124 (29) 95\nNet gains (losses) on derivatives1\n$ 284 $ (70) $ 214\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities:\nUnrealized gains (losses) arising during the year $ (141) $ 48 $ (93)\nReclassification adjustments recognized in net income 4 (1) 3\nNet change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities2\n$ (137) $ 47 $ (90)\nPension and other postretirement benefit liabilities:\nNet pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities arising during the year $ 653 $ (138) $ 515\nReclassification adjustments recognized in net income 265 (66) 199\nNet change in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities3\n$ 918 $ (204) $ 714\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola\nCompany $ 709 $ (438) $ 271\nBefore-Tax Amount Income Tax After-Tax Amount\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nTranslation adjustments arising during the year $ (2,223) $ 150 $ (2,073)\nReclassification adjustments recognized in net income 3 - 3\nGains (losses) on intra-entity transactions that are of a long-term investment nature 2,133 - 2,133']","232 (2)

However, there's a mistake in the calculation: The dividends paid out should not be subtracted when calculating EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). Instead, it is deducted from net income to arrive at earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

The correct calculation for unadjusted EBITDA less capex should be:
Unadjusted EBITDA = Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capex

53,What drove the reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023?," The reduction in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023 was primarily due to higher sales leading to leverage in salon expenses (100 basis points), corporate overhead (180 basis points), store payroll and benefits (90 basis points), and store expenses (50 basis points). This was partially offset by less employee retention credits received under the CARES Act (80 basis points) and higher incentive compensation (60 basis points).","['● 140 basis points of leverage due to favorable channel mix shifts; and\n● 100 basis points of leverage in salon expenses attributed to the impact of higher sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $0.5 billion, or 30.2%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 180 basis points to 23.9% in fiscal 2021 compared to 25.7% in fiscal 2020. The leverage in SG&A expenses was primarily due to:\n● 180 basis points of leverage of corporate overhead due to higher sales;\n● 90 basis points of leverage of store payroll and benefits due to higher sales; and\n● 50 basis points of leverage of store expenses due to higher sales; partially offset by\n● 80 basis points of deleverage due to less employee retention credits received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); and\n● 60 basis points of deleverage due to higher incentive compensation.\nImpairment, restructuring and other costs\nThere were no impairment, restructuring and other costs recognized in fiscal 2021 compared to $114.3 million for fiscal 2020, which consisted of $41.9 million due to the impairment of tangible long-lived assets and operating lease assets associated with certain retail stores, $29.1 million related to the suspension of the planned expansion to Canada, $27.5 million related to the permanent closure of 19 stores, and $15.8 million of severance charges.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses decreased $5.5 million, or 36.6%, to $9.5 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $15.0 million in fiscal 2020 due to current year real estate activity and stores expected to open in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021.\nInterest expense, net', 'Gross profit\nGross profit increased $29.3 million or 3.0%, to $992.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $962.8 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022.
