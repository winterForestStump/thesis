Over the past few years, net income has shown a positive trend with an increase of 126% from the previous year and a decrease of 37% compared to two years ago.","6":" The company's earnings per share for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 is $3.27 for basic and $3.23 for diluted. To compare it to industry benchmarks, we would need additional context on the specific industry standards or averages for similar companies in terms of earnings per share (EPS).

There were no notable trends or fluctuations mentioned specifically related to the cash flow generated from operations during this period.","8":" The company expects to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues, but the exact amount invested is not provided in the context. There are significant projects underway focused around digital capabilities, end-to-end technology foundation, corporate facilities, and improvements across the supply chain.","9":" The company's total outstanding debt is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

There are no signs of inventory management issues mentioned in the provided context.

Corporation. NIKE differentiates itself through its strong brand recognition, innovative product design, global distribution network, and commitment to sustainability and social responsibility initiatives.","15":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include disruptions in distribution facilities due to information technology problems, natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, fires), disease outbreaks, and government actions. To mitigate these risks, the company maintains business interruption insurance but acknowledges it may not fully protect against significant disruptions. Additionally, they face legal, regulatory, and compliance risks that could adversely affect their business. The company also manages financial exposures through derivatives to address global market risks such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate changes.","16":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include difficulties in implementing critical accounting estimates, potential adverse effects on operating results if assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in the assumptions, significant assumptions and estimates related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes, other contingencies, and anti-takeover provisions that may impair acquisitions or reduce common stock prices.","17":" The company's management views the performance measure ROIC as useful in understanding their ability to effectively manage invested capital. They believe it provides additional financial information that should be considered when assessing underlying business performance and trends, but also emphasize that these non-GAAP measures should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated according to U.S. GAAP. The ROIC calculation shows an increase from 21.5% in fiscal year 2022 to 48.8% in fiscal year 2023, indicating improved performance. However, the company expects consolidated revenue growth to be reduced due to a shift in their operating model within Central and South America (CASA) territory.","18":" No, there are no material pending legal proceedings against the company according to the provided context.","19":" Legal issues could potentially lead to adverse effects on the company's sales, ability to collect receivables, and overall financial condition. This can occur due to customer bankruptcies or legal proceedings related to contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property, etc. Additionally, a slowing economy in key markets could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial condition. Legal matters that result in losses above management's expectations can also materially adversely affect the company's financial position, operating results, and cash flows.","20":" The effective tax rate for the company in FY2023 is 18.2%.","21":" Yes, there are both risks and benefits associated with the company's unrecognized tax benefits. The majority of these benefits are long-term in nature and included within deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings, which introduces uncertainty. Additionally, a valuation allowance may be established against net deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely, increasing income tax expense in that period.","22":" I don't know the answer to how much is spent on research and development by the company. The provided context does not include specific information about R&D spending. However, it mentions capitalized research and development expenditures of $548 million for fiscal 2021. This might be related but doesn't directly answer your question.","23":" The company is currently investing in infrastructure to support future growth, focusing on digital capabilities, end-to-end technology foundation, corporate facilities, and supply chain improvements.

However, without more specific data on past dividends or trends over multiple years, it's challenging to assess sustainability accurately.\n\nTo evaluate the sustainability of these payouts, we would need additional information such as:\n- The company's earnings and cash flow history\n- Dividend coverage ratio (dividends paid divided by net income)\n- Changes in dividend policy over time\n- Future growth prospects and capital expenditure plans\n\nBased on the provided data, it appears that the company has maintained a consistent dividend payout for common stock. However, to determine sustainability, further analysis of financial statements and trends is necessary.","25":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs. In June 2018, a four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program was approved by the Board of Directors and began on April 1, 2021. However, it was temporarily suspended during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19 but resumed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. In August 2022, the previous program was terminated and a new four-year, $18 billion share repurchase program was authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2023, the company had repurchased shares under both programs for an approximate total cost of $6.1 billion ($4.7 billion from the first program and $1.4 billion from the second program).","26":" The company offers a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan where all U.S. employees can participate. The company matches a portion of employee contributions to this savings plan. In the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the company's contributions were $136 million, $126 million, and $110 million respectively. Additionally, there are annual discretionary profit sharing contributions made to eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year, as recommended by senior management and approved by the Board of Directors.

This program is designed to lessen the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. When exposures are hedged, it delays the impact of exchange rate movements on Consolidated Financial Statements.","31":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include revenue recognition, off-balance sheet arrangements (such as indemnification agreements), and new accounting pronouncements. Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by altering reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and contingent assets\/liabilities. For example, changes in revenue recognition estimates may impact the timing and amount of recognized revenue, while modifications to off-balance sheet arrangements could lead to material effects on financial position or results of operations if they become significant.","32":" The Company has pension obligations related to unfunded pension liabilities of $64 million as of May 31, 2021 and $29 million as of May 31, 2023.

They have implemented these systems in all geographical regions where they operate and continue investing in integrating, securing, and enhancing them globally. However, the company cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect against cyber-attacks, system failures, or data loss. Potential issues could lead to delays in product fulfillment, reduced operational efficiency, significant capital investments for remediation, and adverse effects on reputation, operations, and financial condition. The company also acknowledges the increased use of employee-owned devices and hybrid work arrangements as additional factors impacting their technology infrastructure. Ongoing technological advancements are part of their continuous efforts to improve these systems.","34":" The company anticipates reduced consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth due to transitioning from a wholesale\/direct-to-consumer operating model to a distributor operating model in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. However, they expect the new model to positively impact overall profitability by reducing selling and administrative expenses and minimizing exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility. The company remains committed to driving future growth and profitability despite ongoing currency market volatility. Strategic plans for upcoming years include Consumer Direct Acceleration, focusing on creating a premium consumer experience, aligning product creation around Mens, Womens, and Kids categories, and unifying investments in data and analytics to accelerate digital transformation. Financial goals through fiscal 2025 aim for high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth, a gross margin rate in the high 40s, and an EBIT Margin in the high teens."},"context":{"0":["As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.\n2021 FORM 10-K 88\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nREVENUES\nNorth America $ 17,179 $ 14,484 $ 15,902\nEurope, Middle East & Africa 11,456 9,347 9,812\nGreater China 8,290 6,679 6,208\nAsia Pacific & Latin America 5,343 5,028 5,254\nGlobal Brand Divisions 25 30 42\nTotal NIKE Brand 42,293 35,568 37,218\nConverse 2,205 1,846 1,906\nCorporate 40 (11) (7)\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

Unit sales of apparel increased 26%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.\nReported EBIT increased 58% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower product costs and lower other costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves, as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing expense. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.\n2021 FORM 10-K 38\nGREATER CHINA\n(Dollars in millions)\nFISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2020 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES FISCAL 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\nRevenues by:\nFootwear $ 5,748 $ 4,635 24 % 19 % $ 4,262 9 % 12 %\nApparel 2,347 1,896 24 % 19 % 1,808 5 % 8 %\nEquipment 195 148 32 % 26 % 138 7 % 11 %\nTOTAL REVENUES $ 8,290 $ 6,679 24 % 19 % $ 6,208 8 % 11 %\nRevenues by:\nSales to Wholesale Customers $ 4,513 $ 3,803 19 % 14 % $ 3,726 2 % 6 %\nSales through NIKE Direct 3,777 2,876 31 % 26 % 2,482 16 % 20 %","\/s\/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPortland, Oregon\nJuly 20, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1974.\n2021 FORM 10-K 56\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2021 2020 2019\nRevenues $ 44,538 $ 37,403 $ 39,117\nCost of sales 24,576 21,162 21,643\nGross profit 19,962 16,241 17,474\nDemand creation expense 3,114 3,592 3,753\nOperating overhead expense 9,911 9,534 8,949\nTotal selling and administrative expense 13,025 13,126 12,702\nInterest expense (income), net 262 89 49\nOther (income) expense, net 14 139 (78)\nIncome before income taxes 6,661 2,887 4,801\nIncome tax expense 934 348 772\nNET INCOME $ 5,727 $ 2,539 $ 4,029\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $ 3.64 $ 1.63 $ 2.55\nDiluted $ 3.56 $ 1.60 $ 2.49\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic 1,573.0 1,558.8 1,579.7\nDiluted 1,609.4 1,591.6 1,618.4\nThe accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n2021 FORM 10-K 57\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nNet income $ 5,727 $ 2,539 $ 4,029\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\nChange in net foreign currency translation adjustment 496 (148) (173)\nChange in net gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (825) (130) 503\nChange in net gains (losses) on other 5 (9) (7)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (324) (287) 323\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME $ 5,403 $ 2,252 $ 4,352\nThe accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n2021 FORM 10-K 58\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nMAY 31,\n(In millions)\n2021 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and equivalents $ 9,889 $ 8,348\nShort-term investments 3,587 439\nAccounts receivable, net 4,463 2,749\nInventories 6,854 7,367\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,498 1,653\nTotal current assets 26,291 20,556\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 4,904 4,866"],"2":["Total invested capital $ 12,196 $ 12,204\nRETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL 48.8 % 21.5 %\n(1)Equals Earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate as of the respective quarter end.\n(2)Total debt includes the following: 1) Current portion of long-term debt, 2) Notes Payable, 3) Current portion of operating lease liabilities, 4) Long-term debt and 5) Operating lease liabilities.\n(3)The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification No. 842, Leases, on June 1, 2019.

For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices.

To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.

A slowing or changing economy in our key markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\nClimate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.","In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and actions of its employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the Companys income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities.

In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens, Womens and Kids'.

During fiscal 2021, the transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKEs businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor partnership.

For more information related to our planned distributor partnership transition within APLA, see Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In future quarters, as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and APLA revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms. However, we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.\nWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, in part due to geopolitical dynamics which may lead to a stronger U.S. Dollar, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability.

In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy: Consumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores, as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on Mens, Womens and Kids'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of our category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Womens and Kids businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation.
