Significant assumptions and estimates used include revenue recognition, inventory reserves, contingent payments, property, plant & equipment accounting, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and other contingencies.\n4. Operating results may be adversely affected if assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from those in the estimates, potentially leading to lower expectations of securities analysts and investors and a decline in Class B Common Stock price.\n5. Anti-takeover provisions could impair an acquisition or reduce the common stock's price.","52":" The company's management views their performance as subject to potential risks and uncertainties due to estimates, judgments, and assumptions made in preparing financial statements. They acknowledge that if these assumptions change or actual circumstances differ from expectations, it could negatively impact operating results and investor confidence. Additionally, anti-takeover provisions may affect the company's acquisition potential or stock price.","53":" There are no material pending legal proceedings against the company.","54":" Legal issues could potentially impact the business of a company in various ways, including financial losses due to litigation or legal disputes, damage to reputation, loss of consumer trust, disruption of operations, expenses related to protecting intellectual property rights and data security, as well as potential fines and lawsuits.

The effective tax rate increased in fiscal year 2018 due to provisions of the Tax Act, including a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. However, some benefits were also realized from share-based compensation under ASU 2016-09 in fiscal year 2018. The company is subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in their effective tax rate due to the Tax Act and potential reforms in foreign tax laws.","57":" The total advertising and promotion expenses referred to as Demand creation expense for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $3,577 million, $3,341 million, and $3,278 million respectively.

The sustainability of the dividend payouts can be assessed by analyzing the company's net income and cash flow trends over time.\n\nBased on the provided data, the company has consistently paid out dividends each year from 2016 to 2019. The total dividends per share for common stock increased steadily during this period, while preferred stock dividends remained constant. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as net income and cash flow trends when evaluating the sustainability of these payouts.\n\nIn 2016-2019, the company's net income ranged from $3,760 in 2016 to $4,029 in 2019. This indicates a generally positive trend in net income over these years. The company has been prof","60":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs for Class B Common Stock as authorized by its Board of Directors.

The Company recognized cash awards under this plan amounting to $83 million in 2019, $33 million in 2018, and $21 million in 2017.","62":" The company's corporate culture is characterized by compliance with extensive laws and regulations, involvement in various types of claims and lawsuits, potential legal risks due to its global operations, and the need for management attention towards legal proceedings which could impact business focus. It also emphasizes high-quality employees as a key factor for success. However, specific details about the company's corporate culture are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.","63":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns through its commitment to sustainability initiatives. While the provided context does not explicitly mention ESG or specific sustainability initiatives, NIKE, Inc. focuses on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services across various sport categories. The company's investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms, enterprise resource planning tools for digital transformation, and global brand campaigns indicate a commitment to responsible business practices that align with ESG principles.

The decrease in Corporate revenues (-$7 million) is due to foreign currency hedge gains\/losses, which are considered non-GAAP financial measures.","65":" The company manages currency risk by employing a centralized foreign exchange risk management program that utilizes natural offsets and currency correlations within their portfolio, as well as hedging with derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. This program is designed to lessen the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The company does not engage in trading or speculative purposes for these derivatives. Impacts on financials due to currency fluctuations are mitigated by delaying the impact of exchange rate movements through hedging strategies.","66":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include revenue recognition, payable terms for inventory purchases (60 days after shipment), and letters of credit outstanding ($165 million as of May 31, 2018). Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by altering reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, changes in revenue recognition or payable terms may impact the timing and amount of recognized revenue and accounts receivable\/payable, while modifications to letters of credit could affect reported financial obligations.","67":" The company has pension plans available only for local employees in various countries worldwide, which are generally government mandated. As of May 31, 2018, there was a liability related to unfunded pension liabilities amounting to $70 million and $107 million at May 31, 2017 and 2018 respectively. These liabilities are primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities. There is no information provided about a pension fund surplus or deficit.","68":" The company heavily relies on information technology systems and networks across its supply chain for various business activities such as product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, distribution, and financial reporting. These IT systems are critical to the company's operations and may be negatively impacted by service interruptions or shutdowns. The company has implemented these systems in all geographical regions where it operates and continues to invest in integrating, securing, and enhancing them as part of its ongoing efforts. However, failures in these systems due to security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor interruptions, or other causes could lead to delays in product fulfillment, reduced operational efficiency, significant capital investments for remediation, and potential adverse effects on the company's reputation, operations, and financial condition. The company acknowledges that these challenges may not be fully covered by existing investments.","69":" The company anticipates opportunities for future growth despite foreign currency market volatility due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger U.S. Dollar. They remain committed to managing their business effectively and achieving financial goals over the long-term by executing operational strategies, including investments in data and analytics capabilities, digital commerce platforms, enterprise resource planning tools for end-to-end digital transformation, and global brand campaigns.

This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China.

The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations.

As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to compete in a digital environment and maintain our brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.\nProduct Safety and Quality","Evolving Consumer Preferences\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles, aging populations and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, consumers want more choices. We are committed to meeting their needs and to generating new growth through our portfolio of more than 500 brands and more than 4,100 beverage products, including nearly 1,300 low- and no-calorie products, new product offerings, innovative packaging and ingredient education efforts. We are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their ever-changing needs, desires and lifestyles.\nIncreased Competition and Capabilities in the Marketplace\nOur Company is facing strong competition from some well-established global companies and numerous regional and local companies. We must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and market share while we selectively expand into other profitable categories of the nonalcoholic beverage segment of the commercial beverage industry.\nProduct Safety and Quality\nAs the world's largest beverage company, we strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to share safe and refreshing beverages with the world. We have rigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage options to meet consumers' evolving needs and preferences. Across the Coca-Cola system, we take great care in an effort to ensure that every one of our beverages meets the highest standards for safety and quality."],"14":["Competition\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nUnfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.","The Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $97 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $35 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\nunrealized loss of $5 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have increased the net unrealized loss to $6 million."],"16":["The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with \" ITEM 7.

In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.

Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing market.\nIf we do not successfully manage the possible negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause deterioration in employee morale which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to","Our consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.\nPatents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to in this report as technology. This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and\ncertain software.

For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate resulted in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of approximately 29%. Certain provisions of the Tax Act, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, were not effective for the Company until fiscal 2019. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.

The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.","2019 FORM 10-K 43 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries.
