1,What is the company's cost of goods sold (COGS) and how does the COGS compare to the total revenue?,Walmart Inc.," The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is $394,605 million for the most recent fiscal year. To compare COGS to total revenue, we can calculate the COGS as a percentage of net sales by dividing COGS by total revenues and multiplying by 100: ($394,605 / $523,964) * 100 = 75.4%. This means that approximately 75.4% of the company's net sales are attributed to COGS for the most recent fiscal year.","[""Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.\nPayments from Suppliers\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.\nOperating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.\nAdvertising Costs"", '4,582\nTotal revenues\n523,964\n514,405\n500,343\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales\n394,605\n385,301\n373,396\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses\n108,791\n107,147\n106,510\nOperating income\n20,568\n21,957\n20,437\nInterest:\nDebt\n2,262\n1,975\n1,978\nFinance, capital lease and financing obligations\nInterest income\n(189\n)\n(217\n)\n(152\n)\nInterest, net\n2,410\n2,129\n2,178\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n3,136\nOther (gains) and losses\n(1,958\n)\n8,368\n-\nIncome before income taxes\n20,116\n11,460\n15,123\nProvision for income taxes\n4,915\n4,281\n4,600\nConsolidated net income\n15,201\n7,179\n10,523\nConsolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(320\n)\n(509\n)\n(661\n)\nConsolidated net income attributable to Walmart\n$\n14,881\n$\n6,670\n$\n9,862\nNet income per common share:\nBasic net income per common share attributable to Walmart\n$\n5.22\n$\n2.28\n$\n3.29\nDiluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart\n5.19\n2.26\n3.28\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n2,850\n2,929\n2,995\nDiluted\n2,868\n2,945\n3,010\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n2.12\n$\n2.08\n$\n2.04\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nConsolidated net income\n$\n15,201\n$\n7,179\n$\n10,523\nConsolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(320\n)\n(509\n)\n(661\n)\nConsolidated net income attributable to Walmart\n14,881\n6,670\n9,862\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes\nCurrency translation and other\n(226\n)\n2,540\nNet investment hedges\n(405\n)\nCash flow hedges\n(399\n)\n(290\n)\nMinimum pension liability\n(1,244\n)\nUnrealized gain on available-for-sale securities\n-\n-\n1,501\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes\n(1,235\n)\n(113\n)\n4,220\nOther comprehensive (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\n(28\n)\n(169\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to Walmart\n(1,263\n)\n4,051\nComprehensive income, net of income taxes\n13,966\n7,066\n14,743']"," No. The retrieved document does not contain information related to the user question about the company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or its comparison with total revenue.

2,"What is the company's gross profit margin, and how has it evolved?",Walmart Inc.," The company's gross profit margin decreased to 24.3% in fiscal 2018, down from 24.9% in the previous year (fiscal 2017). This decline is attributed to strategic price investments and impairment charges in certain markets during that period.","[""Gross profit rate decreased 41 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was due to Flipkart and strategic price investments in certain markets. For fiscal 2018, the decrease in the gross profit rate was primarily due to strategic price investments in certain markets.\nMembership and other income decreased 22.4% and 14.0% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal 2017, which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019. While fiscal 2018 was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSam's Club Segment"", ""Fiscal Period\nTotal Number of\nShares Repurchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\n(in dollars)\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nPrograms\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nShares that May Yet Be\nPurchased Under the\nPlans or Programs(1)\n(in billions)\nNovember 1-30, 2017\n6,816,775\n$\n93.00\n6,816,775\n$\n19.8\nDecember 1-31, 2017\n5,594,137\n97.92\n5,594,137\n19.2\nJanuary 1-31, 2018\n4,170,041\n102.37\n4,170,041\n18.8\nTotal\n16,580,953\n16,580,953\n(1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the current plan at the end of the month.

There is a notable decline in both net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 due to various factors such as contributions to the Asda pension plan, inclusion of Flipkart operations, timing of vendor payments, increased capital expenditures, and other reasons.","[""We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows."", 'Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company\'s free cash flow.

21,Are there any tax-related risks or benefits for the company mentioned?,Walmart Inc.," Yes, there are both risks and benefits related to the company's tax situation. The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 brought significant changes to U.S. income tax law, including reduced statutory tax rates, new taxes on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, as well as a one-time transition tax for accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The company faced risks due to the complexity of applying these provisions and had valuation allowances on deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards. However, there were also benefits such as a $207 million net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act, although this was followed by an additional $442 million of tax expense recorded in fiscal 2019.

Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI""). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Management completed the Company\'s accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes.', ""The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2018 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2018, decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

For fiscal 2019, the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.\nFor fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software.
