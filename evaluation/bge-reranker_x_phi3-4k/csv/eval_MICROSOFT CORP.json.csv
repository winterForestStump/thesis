The retrieved document provides relevant information for calculating the company's current ratio and quick ratio. The current assets and current liabilities are mentioned in the balance sheet section, which allows us to compute both ratios. However, the document does not provide industry averages for comparison purposes. To fully answer your question, additional research on industry averages would be required.

[Document Relevance Score: 1]"," No    
However, based on the provided data, we cannot directly determine the company's current ratio or quick ratio as specific figures for current assets and current liabilities are not given. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities, while the quick ratio subtracts inventory from current assets before dividing them by current liabilities. To provide a comparison with industry averages, please supply the necessary financial data.

Here's an example calculation using hypothetical values:

15,What are the company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K and how does the company plan to mitigate these risks?,MICROSOFT CORP," The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include abrupt political change, terrorist activity, armed conflict (e.g., ongoing conflict in Ukraine), regional epidemics or global pandemics like COVID-19, geopolitical instability leading to sanctions and market interventions, changing regulatory systems and requirements, potential supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, increased costs of managing business aspects, and risks related to the evolution of their products and services.

To mitigate these risks, the company plans to:
1. Monitor geopolitical developments closely and adapt operating strategies accordingly.
2. Implement measures to contain regional epidemics or global pandemics while considering potential intensification of other risks.
3. Continuously invest in research, development, marketing, and innovation for existing products and services.
4. Develop new AI platform services and incorporate AI into existing offerings.
5. Invest in a variety of hardware to maintain productivity, communication, and entertainment capabilities.
6. Monitor customer perceptions and feedback on their latest offerings to ensure they","[""Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.

We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities.
