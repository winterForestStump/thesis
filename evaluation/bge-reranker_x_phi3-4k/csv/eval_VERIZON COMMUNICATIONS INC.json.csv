1,What is the company's cost of goods sold (COGS) and how does the COGS compare to the total revenue?,VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC," The company's cost of goods sold (COGS) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Total Operating Revenues = $126,342 million
Operating Income = $33,392 million
COGS = Total Operating Revenues - Operating Income
COGS = $126,342 million - $33,392 million
COGS = $92,950 million

The answer does not directly reference any specific facts presented in the set of facts but attempts to calculate COGS based on available figures (Total Operating Revenues and Operating Income). However, it's important to note that while the calculation is mathematically correct given those two pieces of data, the context provided doesn't explicitly state these values as total revenue or operating income for a specific year. The answer assumes knowledge beyond what was directly stated in the facts (e.g., knowing which figures correspond to which years), making it not fully grounded solely on the presented facts without additional clarification or data.

Furthermore, calculating COGS from Total Operating Revenues and Operating Income is a simplistic approach that doesn't account for all components of operating expenses (e.g., Selling, General & Administrative Expense) which are subtracted to arrive at Operating Income. A more accurate calculation would require knowing the specific values for these other expenses or directly referencing total revenue figures if available in the context provided.

Given this nuance and assuming no additional data is accessible beyond what's presented, a strict ""yes"" or ""no"" answer", yes

The retrieved document does not contain information related to the company's current ratio, quick ratio, or industry averages for comparison. The document mainly discusses various financial figures such as dividends declared, balance sheets, comprehensive income, and other accounting details but lacks specific data on liquidity ratios like the current ratio and quick ratio."," Yes, the answer is grounded in the facts provided. The current ratio for Verizon Communications Inc. at the end of year 13 is indeed calculated by dividing the total current assets ($71,993 million) by the total current liabilities ($60,464 million), resulting in a current ratio of approximately 1.2 (rounded to one decimal place).

Regarding the quick ratio calculation, it seems there is missing information for accounts receivable at the end of year 13. However, based on the provided data, we can calculate the quick assets as follows: Quick Assets = Cash + Marketable Securities = $20,458 million (cash) + $9,769 million (marketable securities). The current liabilities are given as $60,464 million. Therefore, the quick ratio is calculated as follows: Quick Ratio = ($20,227 million / $60,464 million.

Comparing this with the previous year (December 31, 2021), there is a decrease from $3,055 million to $2,388 million. This significant reduction could indicate effective inventory management or potential issues such as lower demand for products or overstocking in prior periods.

19,What potential impact could legal issues have on the business of the company?,VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC," Legal issues such as patent infringement litigation can disrupt the supply chain and technology development for the company, potentially affecting its business operations. Additionally, labor contract renegotiations with unions may lead to increased costs or work stoppages, adversely impacting business operations. Regulatory changes and governmental proceedings could restrict the company's ability to expand, introduce new products/services, and maintain licenses, potentially inhibiting growth and financial stability.","['The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.1\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 24.0% of our workforce is represented by the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce outside of our traditional wireline operations is represented by unions for bargaining, we cannot predict what impact increased union density in this workforce could have on our operations.\nEconomic and Strategic Risks\nWe face significant competition that may reduce our profits.', 'Regulatory and Legal Risks\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.\nOur domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state, and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.']", yes," Yes

With respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers include cable companies and others. We face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc. and others are offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless providers voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content.', 'To compensate for the shrinking market for traditional copper-based products, we continue to build fiber-based networks supporting data, video and advanced business services - areas where demand for reliable high-speed connections is growing. We are transforming the architecture of our networks into our Intelligent Edge Network, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost-efficient manner.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations were significant during 2020, which affects the comparability of the results from 2021 to 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain, including the recent surge of new virus variants across the U.S. We remain committed to caring for the health and safety of our employees and our customers through this challenge while supporting the communities in which we operate. While we have not experienced a material impact on our business from these new variants thus far, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate impact they may have on our results of operations in the future, and will continue to monitor their daily evolution. For a discussion of the risks to our business from COVID-19, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors.\nRecent Development\nIn January 2022, we successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022.\nConsolidated Results of Operations']", yes," Yes

24,What is the company's dividend history and how sustainable are the dividend payouts?,VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC," The company's dividend history shows that Verizon has increased its quarterly dividend payment by 2% during the third quarter of each year since 2017, making it the sixteenth consecutive year with a dividend increase as of 2022. This demonstrates a sustainable approach to dividend payouts, considering that Verizon's Board of Directors assesses and adjusts the level of dividends based on factors such as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements, and shareholder expectations. The company has paid $10.8 billion in dividends during 2022, indicating a significant use of capital resources for this purpose.","['In our Business segment, we expect wireless revenue to expand, driven by growth from increases in wireless volumes and fixed wireless access contributions. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth.

We expect to see a decrease in operating revenues as a result of this divestiture.\n2022 Operating Expense and Cash Flow from Operations Trends\nWe expect our consolidated operating income margin and adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin to remain strong as we continue to drive revenue growth and undertake initiatives to reduce our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business in 2022 and beyond. Business Excellence initiatives include zero-based budgeting methodology, driving capital efficiencies from the architecture of the networks and evolving our Information Technology strategy. We believe our additional investments in our Business segment in both product simplification and continued focus on process improvements and new work tools will drive cost savings and create incremental growth opportunities in areas such as 5G and One Fiber.\nWe create value for our shareholders by investing the cash flows generated by our business in opportunities and transactions that support continued profitable growth, thereby increasing customer satisfaction and usage of our products and services. In addition, we have used our cash flows to maintain and grow our dividend payout to shareholders.

See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on noncontrolling interests.

During the third quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend payment by 2.0% to $0.6525 from $0.6400 per share in the preceding quarter.

31,What are the company's critical accounting policies disclosed and how might changes in these policies affect financial statements?,VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC," The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include the treatment of wireless licenses and goodwill as indefinite-lived intangible assets, not amortized but tested for impairment annually or earlier if necessary. Estimates and assumptions used in fair value calculations may change over time, potentially affecting future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies, multiples, discount rates, and resulting in different fair value estimates. Significant changes to these estimates could lead to impairment of wireless licenses and goodwill for reporting units.","['Critical Accounting Estimates\nA summary of the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements are as follows:\nWireless Licenses and Goodwill\nWireless licenses and Goodwill are a significant component of our consolidated assets. Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates. Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and assumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units.\nWireless Licenses', 'Dividends declared ($2.585, $2.535, $2.485 per share)\n(10,860) (10,532) (10,284)\nOther (9) (4) -\nBalance at end of year 82,380 71,993 60,464\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nBalance at beginning of year attributable to Verizon\n(927) (71) 998\nForeign currency translation adjustments (153) (141) 180\nUnrealized gain (loss) on cash flow hedges 322 (85) (571)\nUnrealized loss on fair value hedges (431) - -\nUnrealized loss on marketable securities (25) (9) (2)\nDefined benefit pension and postretirement plans (651) (621) (676)\nOther comprehensive loss (938) (856) (1,069)\nBalance at end of year attributable to Verizon\n(1,865) (927) (71)\nTreasury Stock\nBalance at beginning of year (93,635) (4,104) (153,304) (6,719) (155,606) (6,820)\nEmployee plans (Note 14) 2,048 90 2,057 90 2,298 101\nShareholder plans (Note 14) 15 1 15 1 4 -\nAcquisitions (Note 3) - - 57,597 2,524 - -\nBalance at end of year (91,572) (4,013) (93,635) (4,104) (153,304) (6,719)\nDeferred Compensation-ESOPs and Other\nBalance at beginning of year 538 335 222\nRestricted stock equity grant 423 369 275\nAmortization (168) (166) (162)\nBalance at end of year 793 538 335\nNoncontrolling Interests\nBalance at beginning of year 1,410 1,430 1,440\nTotal comprehensive income 492 553 547\nDistributions and other (Note 14) (583) (573) (557)\nBalance at end of year 1,319 1,410 1,430\nTotal Equity $ 92,463 $ 83,200 $ 69,272\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nVerizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNote 1.

Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see ""Fair Value Measurements"" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.\nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.\nIntangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization']", yes," Yes
