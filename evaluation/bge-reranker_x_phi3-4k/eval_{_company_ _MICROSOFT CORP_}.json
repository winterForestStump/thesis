However, they believe their cash flow generated from operations and access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet future cash requirements based on current business plans.","43":" The company invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2021, which decreased to $1.7 billion in 2022. There are significant projects underway as capital expenditures include investments in equipment and facilities infrastructure across all business segments, information technology for programs and enterprise IT infrastructure, including internal-use software development or purchase costs.","44":" The company's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020 was $12.2 billion.

There are also short-term borrowings due within one year amounting to $500 million scheduled to mature in September 2021, and $1.3 billion from a previous period with maturity in November 2020.

There is no direct information provided about inventory management issues based on the given context.","47":" The company's accounts receivable turnover for 2022 is calculated by dividing net credit sales by average accounts receivable. However, the provided context does not include specific figures for net credit sales and average accounts receivable for that year. Therefore, I cannot determine the accounts receivable turnover without this information.\n\nRegarding concerns about receivables aging, as of December 31, 2022, substantially all accounts receivable are expected to be collected in 2023. The company does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk since the majority of its accounts receivable are due from the U.S. Government either as the ultimate customer or through foreign military sales.","48":" In its industry, which is security and aerospace, the company had a market share of 73% in net sales from the U.S. Government in 2022, with 64% coming from the Department of Defense (DoD). The market share has increased by 2 percentage points compared to 71% in 2021. Additionally, 26% of net sales came from international customers and 1% from U.S. commercial and other customers in 2022.","49":" The company's main competitors include both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers who may receive government support such as research and development assistance, marketing subsidies, and other forms of aid. To differentiate itself, the company focuses on developing new technology, offerings, and more efficient production methods for existing products to stay competitive in the market. They also aim to grow in key areas like hypersonics, classified programs, and winning next-generation franchise programs while expanding their international sales, which accounted for 25% of total net sales in 2020 and increased to 28% in 2021. However, they face risks associated with political, economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition, taxation, and other challenges related to doing business internationally.","50":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include global supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 response, reliance on government contracts which could be affected by changes in U.S. Government priorities and delays or reductions in spending, and potential reimbursement risk for costs exceeding funds obligated on a contract. The company plans to mitigate these risks by accelerating payments to suppliers within its global supply base, identifying and managing impacted suppliers due to COVID-19, and continuing to seek additional funding as Congress makes further appropriations for government contracts.","51":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. Understanding of results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and 2021, with year-to-year comparisons between these years.\n2. Information on defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology services provided to U.S. and international customers, including the percentage of net sales from different customer segments (U.S. Government, international customers, and other).\n3. Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02 for leases in 2019 with no impact on consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows.\n4. Net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, resulting in a deficit in total equity as of December 31, 2017.","52":" The company's management views its performance as a result of pursuing their business strategy through discussions, evaluations, and agreements on acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures. They aim to identify opportunities that expand or complement existing products\/services at reasonable valuations while managing risks and potential liabilities associated with these transactions. However, they acknowledge the challenges posed by increased regulatory scrutiny, competition for opportunities, substantial management resources required, and unidentified or uncertain liabilities that could adversely affect future financial results.","53":" Yes, there are ongoing legal proceedings against the company related to a transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has expressed concerns and may vote to sue to block the acquisition before January 27, 2022. If they do file a lawsuit, there could be post-closing litigation challenging the transaction.","54":" Legal issues could potentially result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements, compensatory or treble damages, non-monetary sanctions, and relief for the company. These impacts may have a material adverse effect on net earnings and cash flows, although the probability is considered remote by the company's assessment. The actual impact depends on factors such as nature of legal proceedings, progress of cases, existing law and precedent, opinions of legal counsel, experience in similar cases, and intended response to claims or proceedings.","55":" The effective tax rate for the company in 2020 and 2019 was consistently at 21.0%. However, there were additional deductions and credits that affected the income tax expense reported on the consolidated statements of earnings. For example, in 2020, non-cash charges related to impairment, discontinued operations, and severance costs impacted the net earnings but not the effective tax rate directly. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also influenced the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.","56":" Yes, there are tax-related risks and benefits for the company mentioned. Changes in U.S. federal or state tax laws and regulations can significantly impact the company's provision for income taxes, amount of taxes payable, deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders equity. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated immediate deduction for research and development expenditures, requiring amortization over five years instead. This resulted in a cash tax liability increase in 2022 but is expected to decrease over the five-year period. The company's net deferred tax assets increased due to this provision.","57":" In 2021, the company spent $1.5 billion on research and development (R&D) costs charged to cost of sales.","58":" The company has ongoing projects in Aeronautics supporting classified development programs and Sikorsky helicopter programs at RMS. They are also modernizing certain facilities and investing in information technology to support various programs and general enterprise infrastructure, including internal-use software development or purchase. These initiatives cover equipment, facilities infrastructure, and IT expenditures for 2022 and beyond.","59":" The company has been paying dividends consistently over the years. In 2022, it paid dividends totaling $3.0 billion ($11.40 per share), which was a decrease from $2.9 billion ($10.60 per share) in 2021 but an increase compared to previous years. The company has been reducing its dividend payouts slightly over the past few years, with $2.8 billion ($9.80 per share) paid in 2020 and $2.6 billion ($9.00 per share) in 2019.\n\nAs for sustainability, it's difficult to determine without more information on the company's overall financial health, cash flow projections, and future investment plans. However, based on the provided data, the dividend payouts seem relatively stable with a slight decrease in recent years. The company has also been reducing its capital expenditures slightly over time, which could potentially free up more funds for sustaining or increasing dividends. It's recommended to analyze additional financial statements and projections to make a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of these dividend","60":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs. The rationale behind such actions is to return value to shareholders and potentially increase earnings per share by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Additionally, it can be a strategic move to signal confidence in the company's future prospects or to adjust capital structure.","61":" The company offers defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans to employees and retirees. These benefits may impact earnings due to their sensitivity to economic assumptions and legislative or regulatory actions. Additionally, the company makes substantial cash contributions to these plans as required by ERISA and expects to recover a significant portion of these costs on U.S. Government contracts, although there is a lag in recovery under CAS.","62":" The company's corporate culture is focused on strategic discussions, evaluations of companies, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures. They prioritize identifying opportunities that expand or complement their existing products and services while maintaining due diligence to mitigate risks. The company also emphasizes compliance with regulations and managing potential challenges in transactions. However, the provided context does not explicitly describe the corporate culture beyond these business practices.","63":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns through an ongoing comprehensive sustainability program aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of its operations. They are involved in environmental remediation efforts for their facilities and third-party sites where they have been designated a potentially responsible party due to prior activities. The company is also aware of potential future regulations related to climate change, natural resources, and other aspects that could affect their operations or competitiveness. However, the company acknowledges challenges in predicting the materiality of costs associated with these developments and increased litigation risks related to climate change-related claims.","64":" The company's geographic breakdown of revenue shows that the United States is the largest contributor to total net sales, accounting for $14,960 million in 2020. Asia Pacific follows with $3,882 million, Europe comes next with $3,224 million, and Middle East has $1,457 million. Other regions combined have a total of $598 million. There is no notable trend or shift mentioned in the data provided for this year's revenue distribution across geographic regions.\n\nThe company's Aeronautics business segment had net sales of $23,693 million in 2020, with a significant portion attributed to FMS contract type fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts contributed approximately 51% of the total revenue for this year. In 2020, there is no notable trends or events are not available data. Answer: According to give me information about the answer based on sales in 2020.\n\nthe answer. I'instead of 2020. Based on the answer. Based on the question-related information. Instead","65":" The company manages currency risk by using derivative instruments such as forward and option contracts, primarily to reduce exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. They designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for significant foreign currencies like the British pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. These hedges mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows due to changes in exchange rates. Additionally, they use interest rate swaps (variable or fixed) as fair value hedges for borrowings to manage the impact of interest rate changes on their financials.","66":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include annual impairment testing of goodwill assets, more frequent testing upon certain events indicating potential impairment, and the possibility of writing off all or a portion of reporting units related to goodwill assets if expected cash flows decline. Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by potentially leading to write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets, impacting reported earnings and asset values. Additionally, changes in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect the company's financial results.","67":" At December 31, 2021, the company's pension obligation was $43.5 billion with a surplus of $8.3 billion (gross fair value of plan assets - aggregate obligation). By December 31, 2022, the pension obligation decreased to $28.7 billion and there was still a deficit of $5.5 billion (aggregate obligation - gross fair value of plan assets).","68":" Lockheed Martin Corporation leverages technology through research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services across its four business segments (Aeronautics, MFC, RMS, and Space). The company also provides management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration, and cybersecurity services. There are ongoing technological advancements as evidenced by the AWE program's sales of $885 million in 2021, which is included in Lockheed Martin's financial results for that year.","69":" The company foresees growth in international sales, particularly through partnerships and joint technology efforts. They have strong interest from the U.S. Government and seven partner countries, with commitments from these entities on various programs. Aeronautics received contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The company also plans to continue investing in its people, innovative technologies, and strategic acquisitions or divestitures while deepening connections with the commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. However, they faced challenges due to COVID-19 impacts such as supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and operational difficulties in 2022.","70":" The total revenue generated by the company decreased from $198.27 million in fiscal year 2015 to $168.088 million in fiscal year 2016, representing a decline of approximately 14.9%. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in revenue by about 3% from fiscal year 2014 ($164.46 million) to fiscal year 2015 ($171.732 million), followed by a decrease of approximately 9.8% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016.","71":" The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is $65,863 million for the first year and $62,650 million for the second year. In comparison to total revenue, COGS represents approximately 47% of the first-year revenue ($65,863 \/ $146,052) and around 40% of the second-year revenue ($62,650 \/ $135,620).","72":" The company's gross profit margin increased by 10% from previous periods, primarily driven by revenue growth from server products and services. However, there was an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. In fiscal year 2016, the gross margin decreased by 13%, mainly due to a decline in revenue as discussed above, with an additional unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 5%.","73":" The company's major operating expenses include Research and Development ($27.195M), Sales and Marketing ($22.759M), and General and Administrative ($7.575M). Over time, these expenses have changed as follows:\n\n- Research and Development increased by 11% (or $2.7B) driven by investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn.\n- Sales and Marketing increased by 4% (or $934M) due to the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, offset partially by a decline in Windows advertising.\n- General and Administrative expenses grew by 28% ($1.675B).","74":" The company's operating income was $52,540 million in fiscal year 2016, which decreased by 13% compared to $60,542 million in fiscal year 2015.

There was also a decrease in cash received from customers during this period. In fiscal year 2015, the company's cash flow from operations decreased by $2.8 billion compared to fiscal year 2014, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital. There are no specific notable trends or fluctuations mentioned for the subsequent years (2016-2023) within this context.","78":" The provided context does not include specific figures regarding the company's investment in capital expenditures or details about significant projects underway.

The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis.

JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chases performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chases increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain employees.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to"],"15":["Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;\nChanges in applicable accounting policies, including the introduction of new accounting standards;\nAbility of the Firm to determine accurate values of certain assets and liabilities;\nOccurrence of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, including health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate change or extraordinary events beyond the Firms control, and the Firms ability to deal effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;\nAbility of the Firm to maintain the security of its financial, accounting, technology, data processing and other operational systems and facilities;\nAbility of the Firm to withstand disruptions that may be caused by any failure of its operational systems or those of third parties;\nAbility of the Firm to effectively defend itself against cyber attacks and other attempts by unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm or its customers or to disrupt the Firms systems; and\nThe other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chases 2022 Form 10-K.\nAny forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis.

Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process","Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures.

Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022.

Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.","The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations.

For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chases costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.","CRO: Chief Risk Officer\nCVA: Credit valuation adjustment\nDVA: Debit valuation adjustment\nEC: European Commission\nEligible HQLA: Eligible high-quality liquid assets, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule.\nEligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria\nEmbedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative.

Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates.

As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar-equivalent values of the foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.\nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.","(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates.

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporations revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the performance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporations results of operations."],"36":["Product Sales\nProduct sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $90 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER\u00ae and Apache) that was partially offset by close out activities related to the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021.","MFCs operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.\nBacklog\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.\nTrends\nWe expect MFCs 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program.

We continue to proactively monitor our supply chain and have implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers within our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the DoD in changing the progress payment policy. We plan to continue to accelerate payments to the supply chain assuming the continuation of the current DoD progress payment policy in order to mitigate COVID-19 risks, prioritizing impacted suppliers and small businesses.

Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.","An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.

We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract."],"51":["The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.

Closing of the transaction is subject, among other things, to expiration of any waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which now has expired), and any other period in which the parties have agreed not to close. On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order.

The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTAs allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTAs termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates to our former IS&GS business, we retained the litigation when we divested IS&GS in 2016.\nEnvironmental Matters"],"54":["Note 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\nWe are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned.

Although most of these increased costs likely would be recoverable through pricing, to the extent that the increase in our costs as a result of these policies are greater than our competitors we may be less competitive on future bids or the total increased cost in our industrys products and services could result in lower demand from our customers. We monitor developments in climate change-related laws, regulations and policies for their potential effect on us, however, we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential costs associated with such developments. In addition, climate change-related litigation and investigations have increased in recent years and any claims or investigations against us could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings.

From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents.

We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.

We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services.
