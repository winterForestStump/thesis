There is no specific information provided about how the revenue has changed over the past few years in the given context. However, it mentions that under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, profit on contracts is estimated based on costs incurred to date and total estimated costs to complete the performance obligations. This implies that changes in estimates of sales and costs over time could affect revenue recognition.","1":" The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for products in 2022 was $(49,577) million. To compare COGS to total revenue, we need the total revenue figure which is not provided in the context given. Therefore, I don't have enough information to make a comparison between COGS and total revenue.","2":" The company's gross profit margin for MFC (Missiles and Fire Control) in 2021 was approximately 14.1%. It remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease to 13.7% in 2020 and an increase back up to 14.2% in 2019. The gross profit margin has evolved slightly over the years but maintained stability within this range.","3":" The company's major operating expenses include operating lease expense, income tax provisions, and state income taxes. Over time, the operating lease expense has been $275 million in 2021, $223 million in 2020, and $239 million in 2019. Cash payments for operating leases were $299 million in 2021, with future minimum lease commitments decreasing from $561 million in 2021 to $379 million in 2022.\n\nIncome tax provisions have varied over the years, with federal income tax expense at rates of 21% for all three years and state income taxes ranging from $96 million in 2019 to $124 million in 2022. The company's total net state income tax expense was $195 million in 2021, $197 million in 2020, and $101 million in 2019.\n\nThe reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory","4":" The company's operating income in 2021 was $1,134 million. To compare it with previous years, we can see that the operating income decreased from $1,191 million in 2019 to $1,134 million in 2021. This represents a decrease of approximately 4.5% over this period.","5":" The company's net income for the current fiscal year (2022) is $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share). Net income trended as follows over the past few years: $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021, and an increase affected by factors mentioned above for 2022.","6":" The company's earnings per share (EPS) for 2021 were $24.50 and for 2020 were $24.00. To compare these figures with industry benchmarks, we would need specific data on the average EPS of companies within the same industry. However, based solely on this information, it appears that the company's EPS remained relatively stable between 2020 and 2021 despite various factors affecting net earnings.","7":" The company's cash flow generated from operations is primarily sourced from cash received from customers, either through payment of invoices or advances from non-U.S. government customers exceeding costs incurred. As for trends and fluctuations, there was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $3.6 billion (December 31, 2021) to $2.5 billion (December 31, 2022). Additionally, the company expects operating profit to decrease in the high single-digit levels from 2021 and anticipates a lower operating profit margin for 2022 compared to 2021. However, they believe their cash flow generated from operations and access to credit markets will be sufficient to meet future cash requirements based on current business plans.","8":" The company invested $1.5 billion in capital expenditures in 2021, which decreased to $1.7 billion in 2022. There are significant projects underway as capital expenditures include investments in equipment and facilities infrastructure across all business segments, information technology for programs and enterprise IT infrastructure, including internal-use software development or purchase costs.","9":" The company's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020 was $12.2 billion. The debt is mainly structured in the form of publicly-issued notes that bear fixed interest rates.

There is no direct information provided about inventory management issues based on the given context.","12":" The company's accounts receivable turnover for 2022 is calculated by dividing net credit sales by average accounts receivable. However, the provided context does not include specific figures for net credit sales and average accounts receivable for that year. Therefore, I cannot determine the accounts receivable turnover without this information.\n\nRegarding concerns about receivables aging, as of December 31, 2022, substantially all accounts receivable are expected to be collected in 2023. The company does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk since the majority of its accounts receivable are due from the U.S. Government either as the ultimate customer or through foreign military sales.","13":" In its industry, which is primarily defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology including cybersecurity, the company had a market share of 73% in net sales from the U.S. Government in 2022, with 64% coming from the Department of Defense (DoD). The remaining 26% came from international customers, while 1% was from U.S. commercial and other customers. To determine how this market share has changed over the years, we would need data on previous years' sales figures. However, based on the provided information, there is a slight increase in market share from 71% (2021) to 73% (2022).","14":" The company's main competitors include both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers who may receive government support such as research and development assistance, marketing subsidies, and other forms of aid. To differentiate itself, the company focuses on developing new technology, offerings, and more efficient production methods for existing products to stay competitive in the market. They also aim to grow in key areas like hypersonics, classified programs, and winning next-generation franchise programs while expanding their international sales, which accounted for 28% of total net sales in 2021.","15":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include global supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 response, reliance on government contracts which could be affected by changes in U.S. Government priorities and delays or reductions in spending, and potential reimbursement risk for costs exceeding funds obligated on a contract. To mitigate these risks, the company plans to accelerate payments to suppliers within its global supply base, identify and manage impacted suppliers due to COVID-19, prioritize affected programs, and seek additional funding as necessary from Congress for government contracts.","16":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. Understanding of results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and 2021, with year-to-year comparisons between these years.\n2. Information on defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology services provided to U.S. and international customers, including the percentage of net sales from different customer segments (U.S. Government, international customers, and other).\n3. Adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), with details on right-of-use operating lease assets and liabilities recorded upon adoption in 2019. There was no impact to consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows as a result of adopting this standard.\n4. A net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share) related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, resulting in a deficit in total equity at December 31, 2","17":" The company's management views its performance as a result of pursuing their business strategy through discussions, evaluations, and agreements on acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures. They aim to identify opportunities that expand or complement existing products\/services at reasonable valuations while managing risks and potential liabilities associated with these transactions. However, they acknowledge the challenges posed by increased regulatory scrutiny, competition for opportunities, substantial management resources required, and unidentified or uncertain liabilities that could adversely affect future financial results.","18":" Yes, there are ongoing legal proceedings against the company related to a transaction with Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has expressed concerns and may vote to sue to block the acquisition before January 27, 2022. If they do file a lawsuit, there could be post-closing litigation challenging the transaction.","19":" Legal issues could potentially impact a company's business by resulting in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements, compensatory or treble damages, non-monetary sanctions, or relief. These outcomes may have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole and its net earnings and cash flows in specific interim reporting periods. The probability of such impact is considered remote by the company, but it depends on various factors like nature of legal proceedings, progress of cases, existing law and precedent, opinions of legal counsel, experience with similar cases, and intended response to claims or proceedings.","20":" The effective tax rate for the company in 2020 and 2019 was consistently at 21.0%. However, there were additional deductions and credits that affected specific quarters of those years. For example, in Q2 2020, a non-cash impairment charge related to an equity method investee resulted in after-tax earnings per share (EPS) of $0.34. In Q3 2020, there was a $0.20 after-tax EPS deduction due to discontinued operations tax matters from the former IS&GS business divested in 2016. Additionally, in Q4 2020, severance charges of $0.08 per share were recorded. It's important to note that these specific charges do not directly reflect the effective tax rate but rather other financial impacts on earnings per share. The overall statutory federal income tax rate remained at 21.0% for both years, with additional deductions and credits influencing certain quarters.","21":" Yes, there are tax-related risks and benefits for the company mentioned. Changes in U.S. federal or state tax laws and regulations can significantly impact the company's provision for income taxes, amount of taxes payable, deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders equity. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated immediate deduction for research and development expenditures, requiring amortization over five years instead. This resulted in a cash tax liability increase in 2022 but is expected to decrease over the five-year period. The company's net deferred tax assets increased due to this provision.","22":" In 2021, the company spent $1.5 billion on research and development (R&D) costs charged to cost of sales.","23":" The company has ongoing projects in Aeronautics supporting classified development programs and Sikorsky helicopter programs at RMS. They are also modernizing certain facilities and investing in information technology to support various programs and general enterprise infrastructure, including internal-use software development or purchase. These initiatives cover equipment, facilities infrastructure, and IT expenditures for 2022 and beyond.","24":" The company has been consistently paying dividends over the years. In 2022, it paid a total of $3.0 billion ($11.40 per share), which was slightly higher than in 2021 when it paid $2.9 billion ($10.60 per share). The company has also been increasing its dividend payouts over the years, with an increase from $9.80 per share in 2020 to $10.60 per share in 2021 and further to $11.40 per share in 2022.\n\nRegarding the sustainability of dividend payouts, it is difficult to determine solely based on this information as it requires a more comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health, cash flow, earnings stability, and future growth prospects. However, the consistent increase in dividends over the years suggests that the company has been able to generate sufficient profits and maintain a stable cash flow to support its dividend payments.","25":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs. The rationale behind such actions typically includes increasing earnings per share (EPS), returning excess cash to shareholders, and potentially boosting stock prices by reducing supply. Additionally, management may have discretion under the program to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and timing in compliance with applicable law and regulation.","26":" The company offers defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans to employees and retirees. These benefits may impact earnings due to their sensitivity to economic assumptions and legislative or regulatory actions. Additionally, the company makes substantial cash contributions to these plans as required by ERISA and expects to recover a significant portion of these costs on U.S. Government contracts, although there is a lag in recovery under CAS.","27":" The company's corporate culture is focused on strategic growth through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures. They prioritize identifying opportunities that expand or complement their existing products and services while maintaining due diligence to mitigate risks. However, the increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators on mergers and acquisitions may limit certain transactions. The company also emphasizes cybersecurity risk management and compliance programs in its operations.","28":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns through an ongoing comprehensive sustainability program aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of its operations. They are involved in environmental remediation efforts for their facilities and third-party sites where they have been designated a potentially responsible party due to prior activities. The company is also aware of potential future regulations related to climate change, natural resources, and other aspects that could affect their operations or competitiveness. However, the company acknowledges challenges in accurately predicting the materiality of costs associated with these developments and increased litigation risks due to climate-related issues.","29":" The company's geographic breakdown of revenue shows that the United States is the largest contributor to total net sales, accounting for $14,960 million in 2020. Asia Pacific follows with $3,882 million, Europe has $3,224 million, and Middle East accounts for $1,457 million. Other regions combined contribute a total of $59.8 million to the net sales.\n\nThere are no notable trends or shifts in geographic revenue distribution mentioned in this data snippet.","30":" The company manages currency risk by using derivative instruments such as forward and option contracts, primarily to reduce exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. They designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for significant foreign currencies like the British pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. These hedges mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows due to changes in exchange rates. Additionally, they use interest rate swaps (variable or fixed) as fair value hedges for borrowings to manage the impact of interest rate changes on their financials.","31":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include annual impairment testing of goodwill assets, more frequent testing upon certain events indicating potential impairment, and the possibility of writing off all or a portion of reporting units related to goodwill assets if expected cash flows decline. Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by potentially leading to write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets, impacting reported earnings and asset values. Additionally, changes in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect the company's financial results.","32":" At December 31, 2021, the company's pension obligation was $43.5 billion with a surplus of $8.3 billion (gross fair value of plan assets - aggregate obligation). By December 31, 2022, the pension obligation decreased to $28.7 billion and there was still a deficit of $5.5 billion (aggregate obligation - gross fair value of plan assets).","33":" Lockheed Martin Corporation leverages technology through research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services across its four business segments (Aeronautics, MFC, RMS, and Space). The company also provides management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration, and cybersecurity services. There are ongoing technological advancements as evidenced by the UK Ministry of Defence's termination of a contract in 2021 to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program, which Lockheed Martin was involved with through its AWE segment. However, specific details about current technological advancements are not provided in the given context.","34":" The company foresees growth in international sales, particularly through partnerships and joint technology efforts. They have strong interest from the U.S. Government and seven partner countries, with commitments from these entities on various programs. Aeronautics received contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The company also plans to continue investing in its people, innovative technologies, and strategic acquisitions or divestitures while deepening connections with the commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. However, they faced challenges due to COVID-19 impacts such as supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and operational difficulties in 2022."},"context":{"0":["Contract liabilities increased $491 million during 2020, primarily due to payments received in excess of revenue recognized on these performance obligations.

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporations revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the performance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporations results of operations."],"1":["Product Sales\nProduct sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $670 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk and lower net sales for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $315 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE on June 30, 2021, partially offset by higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); and approximately $220 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and air dominance weapon systems. These decreases were partially offset by higher product sales of about $240 million at Aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on contracts.\nService Sales\nService sales decreased $91 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in service sales was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $155 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers.

The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $565 million at Aeronautics and $325 million at RMS, partially offset by lower sales of $255 million at MFC. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the and programs. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily a Seahawk sustainment program) and IWSS programs (primarily radar surveillance systems programs). The decrease in service sales at MFC was primarily due to lower volume on energy programs due to the divestiture of the Distributed Energy Solutions business, sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache sensors program), and integrated air and missile defense development programs (primarily PAC-3).\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $340 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily PAC-3); and about $215 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM). These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $90 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER\u00ae and Apache) that was partially offset by close out activities related to the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021.","MFCs operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021.

We continue to proactively monitor our supply chain and have implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers within our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the DoD in changing the progress payment policy. We plan to continue to accelerate payments to the supply chain assuming the continuation of the current DoD progress payment policy in order to mitigate COVID-19 risks, prioritizing impacted suppliers and small businesses. As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.","An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties.

We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract."],"16":["The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition.

Closing of the transaction is subject, among other things, to expiration of any waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which now has expired), and any other period in which the parties have agreed not to close. On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. A post-closing lawsuit could include taking action to seek a declaration that the acquisition is unlawful and to seek divestiture of all or part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business or to enjoin integration of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business with Lockheed Martins business.

While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTAs allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTAs termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court.
