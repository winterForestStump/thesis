The information about gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the U.K. and EU is not directly related to the calculation of gross profit margin.","3":" The company's major operating expenses include transaction expenses, provision for credit losses, depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Over time, these expenses have changed as follows:\n\n1. Transaction expenses are primarily composed of fees paid to payment processors and financial institutions when drawing funds from customers' credit or debit cards, bank accounts, or digital wallets. The cost varies based on the funding mix (credit\/debit card vs. bank account or internal sources) and geographic region.\n2. Provision for credit losses has increased over time due to estimates of current expected credit losses on merchant and consumer credit products. Actual charge-offs have no impact on cash from operating activities.\n3. Depreciation and amortization expenses are non-cash items that decrease the value of assets over time, with a reported increase in 2022 compared to previous years.\n4.

To compare these figures to industry benchmarks, we would need specific data on average earnings per share (EPS) within the company's industry. Unfortunately, this information isn't provided in the given context.","7":" The company generated $5.8 billion from operating activities in 2022. Notable trends include an increase in non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization ($1.3 billion), provision for transaction and credit losses ($1.6 billion), and stock-based compensation ($1.3 billion). There were also changes in income taxes payable, net losses on strategic investments, and other liabilities impacting cash flows from operating activities. Actual cash transaction losses of $1.2 billion and changes in deferred income taxes of $811 million partially offset these adjustments.","8":" The company invested $706 million in capital expenditures in 2022. There are significant projects underway as the net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases and originations of loans receivable, purchases of investments, acquisitions (net of cash acquired), changes in funds receivable from customers, and purchases of property and equipment. However, specific details about significant projects are not provided in the given context.","9":" The company's total outstanding debt is $10,418 million as of December 31st. The debt structure includes fixed-rate notes with varying maturity dates issued in September 2019 ($5 billion), May 2020 ($4 billion), and May 2022 ($3 billion). The interest rates for these notes range from 2.200% to 5.34%.","10":" The company's current ratio and quick ratio cannot be determined from the provided information. However, we can calculate these ratios using the given data for total assets (sum of all balance sheet items except \"Net income\"): $34,859 million.\n\nTo compute the current ratio:\nCurrent Assets = Total Assets - Net Income = $34,859m - $2,419m = $32,440m (approximately)\nCurrent Liabilities = Sum of all liabilities except \"Net income\" and \"Diluted shares\": ($6,872m + $173m + $178m + $55m - $4m) = $7,174m (approximately)\nCurrent Ratio = Current Assets \/ Current Liabilities = $32,440m \/ $7,174m \u2248 4.52\n\nTo compute the quick ratio:\nQuick Assets = Total Assets - Inventory and Prepaid Expenses (not provided)\nSince we don't have inventory and prepaid expenses data, it is not","11":" I don't have the specific inventory data for the company.

Please provide more relevant details or access to financial statements for accurate analysis.","13":" I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about the company's market share or how it has changed over the years. To answer your question accurately, additional data on the company's historical market share would be required.","14":" The company's main competitors include banks and financial institutions offering traditional payment methods (credit\/debit cards, electronic transfers), payment networks, processors, card on file services, providers of various payment products and services (tokenized\/contactless cards, digital wallets, mobile payments, P2P payments, money remittance services, virtual currencies), and smaller or younger companies that may be more agile. The company differentiates itself by partnering with other businesses to establish relationships and offering unique products and services tailored to customer needs.","15":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include cybersecurity and technology risks. To mitigate these risks, the company likely has implemented security measures such as firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular vulnerability assessments. Additionally, they may have a dedicated cybersecurity team to monitor threats and respond promptly to any incidents. The company also emphasizes that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements.","16":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. Active accounts provide management with additional perspective on the overall scale of the platform, but may not have a direct relationship to operating results.\n2. Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the average number of times an account engages in payments activity on the platform within a given period. This metric helps understand customer engagement and underlying trends that could indicate future performance.\n3. Transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV (Total Payment Value) growth, which provides insights into the scale and strength of the payments platform, as well as customer engagement levels.\n4. The company operates in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment focused on countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Changes to laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on the business.","17":" The company's management views the performance by regularly reviewing key metrics, making adjustments to improve accuracy or relevance, and considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues that may impact their business. They also assess impairment losses on investments based on qualitative factors and fair value estimations. Adjustments made for fraudulent activities are not typically reflected in previously reported metrics unless material.","18":" Yes, there is an ongoing legal proceeding against the company. The Shah v. Daniel Schulman et al., Case No. 22-cv-1445, was filed in November 2022 and alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, among other things.","19":" Legal issues can potentially impact PayPal's business by causing financial liabilities through judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, negative publicity, reputational harm, criminal sanctions, or orders that limit product offerings. They may also require changes in business practices, development of new products or technologies, and diversion of management's time and effort. These issues can be costly, disruptive to operations, and unpredictable, potentially resulting in material adverse effects on the company.","20":" The effective tax rate for the company is 28%.","21":" Based on the provided context, there are potential tax-related risks and benefits for the company. The adoption of current expected credit loss standard may impact net income due to changes in accounting estimates. There is a tax benefit associated with unrealized losses on cash flow hedges (4) and investments (120). However, there are also potential tax expenses related to unrealized gains on cash flow hedges (26) and investments (98). The company's net income has fluctuated over the years, which could be influenced by these tax-related factors. Additionally, changes in noncontrolling interest may also have tax implications. It is recommended to consult with a tax professional for a comprehensive analysis of the specific risks and benefits related to the company's tax situation.","22":" I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about how much is spent on research and development by the company.","23":" The company is currently engaged in discussions or negotiations for various strategic transactions including business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions of assets, strategic investments, and commercial\/strategic partnerships. However, the specific innovations or projects are not mentioned in the provided context.","24":" The company has never paid any cash dividends and does not anticipate paying them in the foreseeable future. Instead, they have implemented stock repurchase programs to offset dilution from equity compensation programs and potentially reduce outstanding share count. These programs are subject to market conditions and uncertainties, with no expiration date on authorization. As of September 30, 2022, the company had $16,871 million in facilities owned or leased across the United States and other countries.","25":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs. The rationale behind these actions is to offset the impact of dilution from their equity compensation programs and potentially make opportunistic repurchases of common stock to reduce outstanding share count, subject to market conditions and other factors.","26":" I'm sorry, but based on the provided context, there is no specific information about employee benefits offered by the company. The context mainly discusses workforce reduction, restructuring charges, real estate and facility capacity review, strategic investments, equity awards (PBRSUs), and stock options.","27":" The company's corporate culture is focused on strategic transactions, reputation management, and adaptability to changes such as Brexit. It values global recognition, brand integrity, customer relationships, and operational resilience in the face of uncertainties and risks associated with acquisitions, investments, and market disruptions.","28":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns by regularly reviewing processes for calculating key metrics related to ESG matters. They make adjustments to improve accuracy or relevance when necessary. Additionally, they continuously apply models, processes, and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on their platforms. The company acknowledges the importance of adapting to new laws, regulations, and stakeholder expectations regarding ESG matters to avoid reputational damage or adverse effects on business operations. While specific sustainability initiatives are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that they recognize the significance of ESG issues and take steps to address them.","29":" The provided context does not include specific information about the company's geographic breakdown of revenue or notable trends\/shifts in that regard. However, it mentions that there is no meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues and no individual quarter accounts for more than 30% of annual net revenue. The context also provides a detailed breakdown of operating expenses and transaction revenues but does not offer geographic insights or trends in the company's revenue distribution by region.","30":" The company manages currency risk through foreign currency exchange contracts to offset impacts on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of their subsidiaries. They also set daily foreign currency exchange rates for transactions occurring in multiple currencies, which may result in financial exposure due to incorrect rate setting or fluctuations between rate settings and transaction times. Currency fluctuations can lead to significant gains or losses recorded as other income (expense), impacting the company's financials.","31":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), detailed policies, and control procedures for making estimates and assumptions that directly affect financial condition. These critical estimates involve materiality due to subjectivity and judgment involved, as well as their impact on financial statements being significant within a reasonable range of outcomes. The company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in Form 10-K.\n\nChanges in these critical accounting policies may affect financial statements by altering reported amounts, disclosures, or presentation. For example, changes could impact estimates related to allowance for transaction and credit losses, transition taxes on previously deferred foreign earnings, long-term debt payments, unrecognized tax benefits, liquidity, access to capital, borrowing costs, and legal\/regulatory proceedings. These changes may result in different financial conditions being reported, potentially affecting investors' perceptions of the company's performance and risk profile.","32":" I don't have specific information about the company's pension obligations and contributions or whether there is a surplus or deficit in their pension fund. The provided context discusses revenue recognition, advertising expenses, defined contribution savings plans, stock-based compensation, and other financial aspects of the company but does not mention anything about pension funds.","33":" The company leverages technology by incorporating advancements such as payment technologies (real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies), internet browser technologies for easy storage of payment information, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and technologies supporting regulatory compliance. Ongoing technological advancements are expected to emerge in the industries they operate, potentially rendering current technologies obsolete or superior. The company also engages in strategic transactions involving business combinations, acquisitions, investments, and partnerships that may involve new employees, systems, products, and technologies. However, these advancements come with challenges such as integration difficulties, cybersecurity risks, regulatory uncertainties, and potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets related to transactions.","34":" The company anticipates future growth through strategic transactions such as business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions of assets, investments, and partnerships. However, these transactions may involve challenges like integrating new employees, products, systems, technologies, operations, and cultures; operating in unfamiliar markets or industries; data security risks; potential regulatory oversight issues, and the possibility that a transaction might not align with their business strategy. The company does not provide specific strategic plans for upcoming years but emphasizes ongoing evaluation of various strategic transactions as part of its overall business strategy."},"context":{"0":["Net revenue analysis\nThe components of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\nTransaction revenues\nTransaction revenues grew by $1.8 billion, or 8%, in 2022 compared to 2021 driven primarily by growth in our unbranded card processing volume, which consists primarily of our Braintree products and services, and to a lesser extent, Venmo products and services, in each case driven by growth in TPV and the number of payment transactions on our payments platform. This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated from our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBays marketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from sellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

Based on the information provided to and reviewed by our CODM, we believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services).

Such revenues relate to interest and fees earned on loans and interest receivable, as well as hedging gains or losses, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances.\nNet revenues are attributed to the country in which the party paying our PayPal fee is located.\nNOTE 3-NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive common stock outstanding for the period. The dilutive effect of outstanding equity incentive awards is reflected in diluted net income (loss) per share by application of the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares. During periods when we report net loss, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items would decrease the net loss per share.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income (loss) $ 2,419 $ 4,169 $ 4,202\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares of common stock-basic\n1,154 1,174 1,173\nDilutive effect of equity incentive awards 4 12 14","REVENUE RECOGNITION\nApplication of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.\nVALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES\nThe valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of managements assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.\nEVALUATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT"],"2":["This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations focuses on a discussion of 2022 results as compared to 2021 results.

The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact the funding mix."],"4":["December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the U.K. 29 % 40 %\nGross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the EU 28 % 21 %\nThe change in the percentage of gross loans and interest receivable due from customers in the U.K. and EU year over year was primarily attributable to expansion of our installment credit products in the EU, particularly in Germany where we have increased our product offerings.\nMACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT\nThe broader implications of the macroeconomic environment, including uncertainty around the duration and severity of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), the Russia and Ukraine conflict, supply chain shortages, a recession globally or in markets in which we operate, higher inflation rates, higher interest rates, and other related global economic conditions, remain unknown.

The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and\/or the income approach. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.

When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.

The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology.

We earn additional fees from merchants and consumers: on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees.\nRevenues from other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers.

Higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities. We are generally a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the United States (U.S.) dollar, and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, relative to foreign currencies. We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.","Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (key metrics) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions."],"31":["CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES","Transition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act.\nLong-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $1.9 billion of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nOther considerations\nOur liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES"],"32":["Revenue recognition\nSee Note 2-Revenue for information related to our revenue recognition.\nAdvertising expense\nWe expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $518 million, $740 million, and $654 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as well as trends of actual forfeitures.","7,431 4,846\nFunds receivable and customer accounts 36,357 36,141\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,898 1,287\nTotal current assets 57,517 52,574\nLong-term investments 5,018 6,797\nProperty and equipment, net 1,730 1,909\nGoodwill 11,209 11,454\nIntangible assets, net 788 1,332\nOther assets 2,455 1,737\nTotal assets $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 126 $ 197\nFunds payable and amounts due to customers 40,107 38,841\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 4,055 3,755\nIncome taxes payable 813 236\nTotal current liabilities 45,101 43,029\nDeferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities 2,925 2,998\nLong-term debt 10,417 8,049\nTotal liabilities 58,443 54,076\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 13)\nEquity:\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 4,000 shares authorized; 1,136 and 1,168 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n- -\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 100 shares authorized, unissued\n- -\nTreasury stock at cost, 173 and 132 shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n(16,079) (11,880)\nAdditional paid-in-capital 18,327 17,208\nRetained earnings 18,954 16,535\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (928) (136)\nTotal equity 20,274 21,727\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In millions, except for per share amounts)\nNet revenues $ 27,518 $ 25,371 $ 21,454\nOperating expenses:\nTransaction expense 12,173 10,315 7,934\nTransaction and credit losses 1,572 1,060 1,741\nCustomer support and operations 2,120 2,075 1,778\nSales and marketing 2,257 2,445 1,861\nTechnology and development 3,253 3,038 2,642\nGeneral and administrative 2,099 2,114 2,070\nRestructuring and other charges 207 62 139\nTotal operating expenses 23,681 21,109 18,165\nOperating income 3,837 4,262 3,289"],"33":["If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.\nRapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.\nWe expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.
