Management believes operating margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business after considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Companys performance.\nInformation about our operating margin on a consolidated basis and by operating segment and Corporate is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 2020\nConsolidated 26.7 % 27.3 %\nEurope, Middle East & Africa 56.9 59.9\nLatin America 61.2 60.5\nNorth America 25.3 21.5\nAsia Pacific 49.7 50.6\nGlobal Ventures 10.5 (6.2)\nBottling Investments 6.6 4.9\nCorporate * *\n* Calculation is not meaningful.\nOperating income was $10,308 million in 2021, compared to $8,997 million in 2020, an increase of $1,311 million, or 15 percent. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 9 percent, favorable channel and package mix, effective cost management and a favorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased charitable donations and increased marketing spending.","Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 16 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume was primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively. CCR accounted for 51 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America.\nConcentrate Sales Volume\nIn 2017, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume were both even compared to 2016. In 2016, worldwide unit case sales volume grew 1 percent and concentrate sales volume was even compared to 2015. After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume grew 1 percent during the year ended December 31, 2016. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, structural changes and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income\nPercent Change\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\n2016 vs. 2015\n(In millions except percentages and per share data)\nNET OPERATING REVENUES\n$\n35,410\n$\n41,863\n$\n44,294\n(15\n)%\n(5\n)%\nCost of goods sold\n13,256\n16,465\n17,482\n(19\n)\n(6\n)\nGROSS PROFIT\n22,154\n25,398\n26,812\n(13\n)\n(5\n)\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN\n62.6\n%\n60.7\n%\n60.5\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n12,496\n15,262\n16,427\n(18\n)\n(7\n)"],"5":["Operating income (loss) 3,958 2,870 3,742 2,303 185 487 (2,636) -

The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nUnfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.","The Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company's investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $97 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid securities.\nCommodity Prices\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and distribution business. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to commodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases of materials used in our manufacturing processes and the fuel used to operate our extensive vehicle fleet.\nOpen commodity derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting had notional values of $35 million and $12 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of the contracts that qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\nunrealized loss of $5 million. The potential change in fair value of these commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices, would have increased the net unrealized loss to $6 million."],"16":["The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with \" ITEM 7.

Second, we will increase the effectiveness of our marketing investments by transforming our marketing and commercial model to redeploy resources into more consumer-facing marketing investments to accelerate growth.\nIn October 2014, the Company announced that we were further expanding our productivity and reinvestment program and extending it through 2019.

In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $25.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.
