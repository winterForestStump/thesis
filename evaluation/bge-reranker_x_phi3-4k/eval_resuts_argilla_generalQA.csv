The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.', 'Managing currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent.

The Company enters into hedging activities related to certain commodities in order to mitigate a portion of the price risk associated with forecasted purchases. Many of the derivative financial instruments used by the Company to mitigate the risk associated with these commodity exposures, including any related foreign currency exposure, do not qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments have been, and will continue to be, included as a component of net income in each reporting period. The Company recorded gains related to these derivatives of $14 million and $79 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and recorded a loss of $206 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income.

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 9 percent, favorable channel and package mix, effective cost management and a favorable currency exchange rate impact, partially offset by higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased charitable donations and increased marketing spending.', ""Unit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 16 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume was primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively. CCR accounted for 51 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America.\nConcentrate Sales Volume\nIn 2017, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume were both even compared to 2016.

After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume grew 1 percent during the year ended December 31, 2016.

When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\nWhen we receive direct reimbursements for costs incurred by us in advertising the vendors product or service, the amount we receive is recorded as an offset to Marketing on our consolidated statements of operations.\nFulfillment', 'Cost of sales\n$\n$\n$\nFulfillment\n1,121\n1,182\nTechnology and content\n2,305\n2,888\n3,725\nMarketing\n1,135\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation expense (1)\n$\n4,215\n$\n5,418\n$\n6,864\n___________________\n(1)\nThe related tax benefits were $860 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.4 billion for 2017, 2018, and 2019.\nThe following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions):\nNumber of Units\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of January 1, 2017\n19.8\n$\nUnits granted\n8.9\nUnits vested\n(6.8\n)\nUnits forfeited\n(1.8\n)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2017\n20.1\nUnits granted\n5.0\n1,522\nUnits vested\n(7.1\n)\nUnits forfeited\n(2.1\n)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2018\n15.9\n1,024\nUnits granted\n6.7\n1,808\nUnits vested\n(6.6\n)\nUnits forfeited\n(1.7\n)\n1,223\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2019\n14.3\n1,458\nScheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2019, is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended\nThereafter\nTotal\nScheduled vesting - restricted stock units\n6.0\n5.1\n2.1\n1.0\n-\n0.1\n14.3\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was $8.8 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements.

A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.

Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process', 'Management also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors.

Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.', 'The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations.

These include adverse effects on its financial condition, operations, and reputation. Legal risks may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, or other sanctions that could materially harm the company's business.

JPMorgan Chase also faces a high level of litigation and regulatory investigations related to its operations, which may lead to additional enforcement actions or resolutions.

These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation.

The outstanding principal amount was $16.8 billion and $12.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, excluding $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads (Level 2). We also hold investments in early stage companies. Most of these investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values. Investments with quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period and reflected in other securities in the table above. See Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Investments.\nNote 16 - Severance and Other Charges\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded severance and other charges totaling $100 million ($79 million, or $0.31 per share, after-tax) related to actions at our RMS business segment, which include severance costs for reduction of positions and asset impairment charges. After a strategic review of RMS, these actions will improve the efficiency of our operations, better align the organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions, and changes in program lifecycles.']"," The company's total outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020 was $12.2 billion.

We continue to proactively monitor our supply chain and have implemented multiple actions to help mitigate the effects of COVID-19, including accelerating payments to suppliers within our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the DoD in changing the progress payment policy. We plan to continue to accelerate payments to the supply chain assuming the continuation of the current DoD progress payment policy in order to mitigate COVID-19 risks, prioritizing impacted suppliers and small businesses. As described in Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.', 'An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts\nWe depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government, including contracts related to the program, for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in the U.S. Governments priorities and delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derived 74% of our total net sales from the U.S. Government in 2020, including 64% from the DoD. We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract.']"," The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include global supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 response, reliance on government contracts which could be affected by changes in U.S. Government priorities and delays or reductions in spending, and potential reimbursement risk for costs exceeding funds obligated on a contract. To mitigate these risks, the company plans to accelerate payments to suppliers within its global supply base, identify and manage impacted suppliers due to COVID-19, prioritize affected programs, and seek additional funding as necessary from Congress for government contracts.",YES,YES,YES

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2022, 73% of our $66.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 64% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers.', '(h)Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Upon adoption, we recorded right-of-use operating lease assets of $1.0 billion and operating lease liabilities of $1.1 billion, approximately $855 million of which were classified as noncurrent. There was no impact to our consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows as a result of adopting this standard. Prior periods were not restated for the adoption of ASU 2016-02. See Note 9 - Leases included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(i)In 2017, we recorded a net one-time tax charge of $2.0 billion ($6.77 per share), substantially all of which was noncash, primarily related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (see Note 10 - Income Taxes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). This charge along with our annual re-measurement adjustment related to our postretirement benefit plans of $1.4 billion resulted in a deficit in our total equity as of December 31, 2017. ITEM 7.

Closing of the transaction is subject, among other things, to expiration of any waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (which now has expired), and any other period in which the parties have agreed not to close. On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. A post-closing lawsuit could include taking action to seek a declaration that the acquisition is unlawful and to seek divestiture of all or part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business or to enjoin integration of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business with Lockheed Martins business. There is no assurance that we would be successful in any litigation with the FTC, whether before or after closing.', 'On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTAs failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTAs allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTAs termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties.

Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (Windows OEM) revenue decreased 25%.\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.', 'In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash (the Merger Agreement). We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIns shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.\nIn May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.\nIndustry Trends']"," I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about the company's market share or how it has changed over the years.

These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\nOPERATIONS\nWe have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The center in Ireland supports the African, Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle East regions; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington, Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico support the American regions.', 'Competition\nCompetitors to Office include software and global application vendors such as Adobe Systems, Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Oracle, SAP, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers in Asia and Europe. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note-taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products. We believe our products compete effectively based on our strategy of providing powerful, flexible, secure, and easy-to-use solutions that work well with technologies our customers already have and are available on a device or via the cloud.\nOur Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Oracle and SAP in the market for large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. In the market focused on providing solutions for small and mid-sized businesses, our Dynamics products compete with vendors such as Infor, The Sage Group, and NetSuite. Salesforce.coms cloud CRM offerings compete directly with our Dynamics CRM on-premises and CRM Online offerings.\nIntelligent Cloud\nOur Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises:\nServer products and cloud services, including SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, as well as Azure.']"," The company's main competitors vary across different sectors. In the gaming industry, they compete with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony. For search and news advertising, their primary competitor is Google.

These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.\nWe may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation."", 'RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.']"," The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include abrupt political change, terrorist activity, armed conflict (e.g., ongoing conflict in Ukraine), regional epidemics or global pandemics like COVID-19, geopolitical instability leading to sanctions and market interventions, changing regulatory systems and requirements, potential supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, increased costs of managing business aspects, and risks related to the evolution of their products and services.

To mitigate these risks, the company plans to:
1. Monitor geopolitical developments closely and adapt operating strategies accordingly.

Unit sales of apparel increased 26%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts.\nReported EBIT increased 58% as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower product costs and lower other costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves, as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation and operating overhead expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily driven by lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing expense. Lower operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower bad debt and travel and related expenses, partially offset by higher NIKE Direct variable costs.\n2021 FORM 10-K 38\nGREATER CHINA\n(Dollars in millions)\nFISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2020 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES FISCAL 2019 % CHANGE % CHANGE EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES\nRevenues by:\nFootwear $ 5,748 $ 4,635 24 % 19 % $ 4,262 9 % 12 %\nApparel 2,347 1,896 24 % 19 % 1,808 5 % 8 %\nEquipment 195 148 32 % 26 % 138 7 % 11 %\nTOTAL REVENUES $ 8,290 $ 6,679 24 % 19 % $ 6,208 8 % 11 %\nRevenues by:\nSales to Wholesale Customers $ 4,513 $ 3,803 19 % 14 % $ 3,726 2 % 6 %\nSales through NIKE Direct 3,777 2,876 31 % 26 % 2,482 16 % 20 %', ""/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPortland, Oregon\nJuly 20, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1974.\n2021 FORM 10-K 56\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2021 2020 2019\nRevenues $ 44,538 $ 37,403 $ 39,117\nCost of sales 24,576 21,162 21,643\nGross profit 19,962 16,241 17,474\nDemand creation expense 3,114 3,592 3,753\nOperating overhead expense 9,911 9,534 8,949\nTotal selling and administrative expense 13,025 13,126 12,702\nInterest expense (income), net 262 89 49\nOther (income) expense, net 14 139 (78)\nIncome before income taxes 6,661 2,887 4,801\nIncome tax expense 934 348 772\nNET INCOME $ 5,727 $ 2,539 $ 4,029\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $ 3.64 $ 1.63 $ 2.55\nDiluted $ 3.56 $ 1.60 $ 2.49\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic 1,573.0 1,558.8 1,579.7\nDiluted 1,609.4 1,591.6 1,618.4\nThe accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n2021 FORM 10-K 57\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nYEAR ENDED MAY 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nNet income $ 5,727 $ 2,539 $ 4,029\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\nChange in net foreign currency translation adjustment 496 (148) (173)\nChange in net gains (losses) on cash flow hedges (825) (130) 503\nChange in net gains (losses) on other 5 (9) (7)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax (324) (287) 323\nTOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME $ 5,403 $ 2,252 $ 4,352\nThe accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n2021 FORM 10-K 58\nNIKE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nMAY 31,\n(In millions)\n2021 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and equivalents $ 9,889 $ 8,348\nShort-term investments 3,587 439\nAccounts receivable, net 4,463 2,749\nInventories 6,854 7,367\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,498 1,653\nTotal current assets 26,291 20,556\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 4,904 4,866""]"," The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for the year ended May 31, 2021 is $24,576 million.

For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand.

In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition.

A slowing or changing economy in our key markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see ""Fair Value Measurements"" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.

The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International\'s strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates.

In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""SAB 118""), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Management completed the Company\'s accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes.', ""The Company had valuation allowances of approximately $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

For fiscal 2020, these decreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.\nFor fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal 2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a securities class action lawsuit.', ""Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition.

As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software.

These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam\'s Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites.

The segment\'s net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International\'s strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018.\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel.

At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term.\nComparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year.
