There is no specific information provided about notable trends or shifts by region within the given context. However, it can be observed that there was a significant decrease in net interest income and noninterest revenue from 2021 to 2022, which may have contributed to the overall decline in total net revenue. The company's international consumer growth initiatives are mentioned as a factor for deposit changes (b).","30":" The company manages currency risk by using foreign currency derivatives to offset the variability in U.S. dollar-equivalent values of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions due to fluctuations in foreign currencies. This management strategy impacts financials as gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of related inventory, hedged items, and net interest income. Additionally, certain components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness may impact earnings either through amortization over the life of the derivative or fair value changes recognized in the current period.","31":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include internal control over financial reporting, management reporting for business segments, and the timely availability of annual reports on Form 10-K.

This represents a decrease of approximately 4.5% over this period.","40":" The company's net income for the current fiscal year (2022) is $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share). Net income trended as follows over the past few years: $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021, and an increase affected by factors mentioned above for 2022.","41":" The company's earnings per share (EPS) for 2021 were $24.50 and for 2020 were $24.00. To compare these figures with industry benchmarks, we would need specific data on the average EPS of companies within the same industry. Without that information, it's not possible to make a direct comparison.","42":" The company's cash flow generated from operations is primarily sourced from cash received from customers, either through payment of invoices or advances from non-U.S. government customers exceeding costs incurred. As for trends and fluctuations, there was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $3.6 billion (December 31, 2021) to $2.5 billion (December 31, 2022).

There is no direct information provided about inventory management issues based on the given context.","47":" The company's accounts receivable turnover for 2022 is calculated by dividing net credit sales by average accounts receivable. However, the provided context does not include specific figures for net credit sales and average accounts receivable for that year. Therefore, I cannot determine the accounts receivable turnover without this information.\n\nRegarding concerns about receivables aging, as of December 31, 2022, substantially all accounts receivable are expected to be collected in 2023. The company does not believe it has significant exposure to credit risk since the majority of its accounts receivable are due from the U.S. Government either as the ultimate customer or through foreign military sales.","48":" In its industry, which is security and aerospace, the company had a market share of 73% in net sales from the U.S. Government in 2022, with 64% coming from the Department of Defense (DoD). The market share has increased by 2 percentage points compared to 71% in 2021. Additionally, 26% of net sales came from international customers and 1% from U.S. commercial and other customers in 2022.","49":" The company's main competitors include both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers who may receive government support such as research and development assistance, marketing subsidies, and other forms of aid. To differentiate itself, the company focuses on developing new technology, offerings, and more efficient production methods for existing products to stay competitive in the market. They also aim to grow in key areas like hypersonics, classified programs, and winning next-generation franchise programs while expanding their international sales, which accounted for 25% of total net sales in 2020 and increased to 28% in 2021. However, they face risks associated with political, economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition, taxation, and other challenges related to doing business internationally.","50":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include global supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 response, reliance on government contracts which could be affected by changes in U.S. Government priorities and delays or reductions in spending, and potential reimbursement risk for costs exceeding funds obligated on a contract. The company plans to mitigate these risks by accelerating payments to suppliers within its global supply base, identifying and managing impacted suppliers due to COVID-19, and continuing to seek additional funding as Congress makes further appropriations for government contracts.","51":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. Understanding of results of operations and financial condition for 2022 and 2021, with year-to-year comparisons between these years.\n2.

These impacts may have a material adverse effect on net earnings and cash flows, although the probability is considered remote by the company's assessment. The actual impact depends on factors such as nature of legal proceedings, progress of cases, existing law and precedent, opinions of legal counsel, experience in similar cases, and intended response to claims or proceedings.","55":" The effective tax rate for the company in 2020 and 2019 was consistently at 21.0%. However, there were additional deductions and credits that affected the income tax expense reported on the consolidated statements of earnings.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 also influenced the company's deferred tax assets and liabilities.","56":" Yes, there are tax-related risks and benefits for the company mentioned. Changes in U.S. federal or state tax laws and regulations can significantly impact the company's provision for income taxes, amount of taxes payable, deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders equity. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated immediate deduction for research and development expenditures, requiring amortization over five years instead. This resulted in a cash tax liability increase in 2022 but is expected to decrease over the five-year period. The company's net deferred tax assets increased due to this provision.","57":" In 2021, the company spent $1.5 billion on research and development (R&D) costs charged to cost of sales.","58":" The company has ongoing projects in Aeronautics supporting classified development programs and Sikorsky helicopter programs at RMS. They are also modernizing certain facilities and investing in information technology to support various programs and general enterprise infrastructure, including internal-use software development or purchase.

The company has been reducing its dividend payouts slightly over the past few years, with $2.8 billion ($9.80 per share) paid in 2020 and $2.6 billion ($9.00 per share) in 2019.\n\nAs for sustainability, it's difficult to determine without more information on the company's overall financial health, cash flow projections, and future investment plans. However, based on the provided data, the dividend payouts seem relatively stable with a slight decrease in recent years. The company has also been reducing its capital expenditures slightly over time, which could potentially free up more funds for sustaining or increasing dividends. It's recommended to analyze additional financial statements and projections to make a comprehensive assessment of the sustainability of these dividend","60":" Yes, the company has engaged in share buyback programs.

They prioritize identifying opportunities that expand or complement their existing products and services while maintaining due diligence to mitigate risks. The company also emphasizes compliance with regulations and managing potential challenges in transactions. However, the provided context does not explicitly describe the corporate culture beyond these business practices.","63":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns through an ongoing comprehensive sustainability program aimed at reducing the environmental impacts of its operations. They are involved in environmental remediation efforts for their facilities and third-party sites where they have been designated a potentially responsible party due to prior activities. The company is also aware of potential future regulations related to climate change, natural resources, and other aspects that could affect their operations or competitiveness. However, the company acknowledges challenges in predicting the materiality of costs associated with these developments and increased litigation risks related to climate change-related claims.","64":" The company's geographic breakdown of revenue shows that the United States is the largest contributor to total net sales, accounting for $14,960 million in 2020. Asia Pacific follows with $3,882 million, Europe comes next with $3,224 million, and Middle East has $1,457 million. Other regions combined have a total of $598 million. There is no notable trend or shift mentioned in the data provided for this year's revenue distribution across geographic regions.\n\nThe company's Aeronautics business segment had net sales of $23,693 million in 2020, with a significant portion attributed to FMS contract type fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts contributed approximately 51% of the total revenue for this year. In 2020, there is no notable trends or events are not available data. Answer: According to give me information about the answer based on sales in 2020.\n\nthe answer. I'instead of 2020. Based on the answer. Based on the question-related information. Instead","65":" The company manages currency risk by using derivative instruments such as forward and option contracts, primarily to reduce exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. They designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for significant foreign currencies like the British pound sterling, euro, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. These hedges mitigate fluctuations in earnings and cash flows due to changes in exchange rates. Additionally, they use interest rate swaps (variable or fixed) as fair value hedges for borrowings to manage the impact of interest rate changes on their financials.","66":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include annual impairment testing of goodwill assets, more frequent testing upon certain events indicating potential impairment, and the possibility of writing off all or a portion of reporting units related to goodwill assets if expected cash flows decline. Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by potentially leading to write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets, impacting reported earnings and asset values. Additionally, changes in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect the company's financial results.","67":" At December 31, 2021, the company's pension obligation was $43.5 billion with a surplus of $8.3 billion (gross fair value of plan assets - aggregate obligation). By December 31, 2022, the pension obligation decreased to $28.7 billion and there was still a deficit of $5.5 billion (aggregate obligation - gross fair value of plan assets).","68":" Lockheed Martin Corporation leverages technology through research, design, development, manufacture, integration, and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products, and services across its four business segments (Aeronautics, MFC, RMS, and Space). The company also provides management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration, and cybersecurity services. There are ongoing technological advancements as evidenced by the AWE program's sales of $885 million in 2021, which is included in Lockheed Martin's financial results for that year.","69":" The company foresees growth in international sales, particularly through partnerships and joint technology efforts. They have strong interest from the U.S. Government and seven partner countries, with commitments from these entities on various programs. Aeronautics received contracts in 2020 with Bulgaria and Taiwan for new aircraft, extending work beyond 2025. The company also plans to continue investing in its people, innovative technologies, and strategic acquisitions or divestitures while deepening connections with the commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments. However, they faced challenges due to COVID-19 impacts such as supply chain disruptions, labor challenges, and operational difficulties in 2022.","70":" The total revenue generated by the company decreased from $198.27 million in fiscal year 2015 to $168.088 million in fiscal year 2016, representing a decline of approximately 14.9%. Over the past few years, there has been an increase in revenue by about 3% from fiscal year 2014 ($164.46 million) to fiscal year 2015 ($171.732 million), followed by a decrease of approximately 9.8% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016.","71":" The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is $65,863 million for the first year and $62,650 million for the second year. In comparison to total revenue, COGS represents approximately 47% of the first-year revenue ($65,863 \/ $146,052) and around 40% of the second-year revenue ($62,650 \/ $135,620).","72":" The company's gross profit margin increased by 10% from previous periods, primarily driven by revenue growth from server products and services. However, there was an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. In fiscal year 2016, the gross margin decreased by 13%, mainly due to a decline in revenue as discussed above, with an additional unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 5%.","73":" The company's major operating expenses include Research and Development ($27.195M), Sales and Marketing ($22.759M), and General and Administrative ($7.575M). Over time, these expenses have changed as follows:\n\n- Research and Development increased by 11% (or $2.7B) driven by investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn.\n- Sales and Marketing increased by 4% (or $934M) due to the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, offset partially by a decline in Windows advertising.\n- General and Administrative expenses grew by 28% ($1.675B).","74":" The company's operating income was $52,540 million in fiscal year 2016, which decreased by 13% compared to $60,542 million in fiscal year 2015.

There was also a decrease in cash received from customers during this period. In fiscal year 2015, the company's cash flow from operations decreased by $2.8 billion compared to fiscal year 2014, mainly due to an increase in materials and production costs as well as payments related to restructuring charges and other changes in working capital. There are no specific notable trends or fluctuations mentioned for the subsequent years (2016-2023) within this context.","78":" The provided context does not include specific figures regarding the company's investment in capital expenditures or details about significant projects underway.

The company plans to mitigate these risks by implementing policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, promoting employee health and safety, providing critical infrastructure and connectivity to customers, and closely monitoring supplier relationships and regulatory changes.","156":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. In 2022, Consumer segment revenues were $103.5 billion, representing approximately 76% of Verizon's consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2022, the Consumer segment had around 115 million wireless retail connections (80% postpaid), 8 million total broadband connections (including Fios internet, DSL and FWA), and 3 million Fios video connections.\n\n2. The Business segment's revenues were $31.1 billion in 2022, representing approximately 23% of Verizon's consolidated revenues. As of December 31, 2022, the Business segment had around 29 million wireless retail postpaid connections and 1 million total broadband connections (including Fios internet, DSL, and FWA).\n\n3. In January 2022, Verizon successfully deployed C-Band spectrum, reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S.\n","157":" I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information on how the company's management views the company performance. It mainly discusses operating statistics related to wireless retail connections and Fios internet connections.","158":" Yes, there are ongoing legal proceedings against Verizon involving approximately 25 federal district court actions alleging patent infringement. Most of these cases are brought by non-practicing entities seeking monetary damages, and a small number involve companies that have sold products and could seek injunctive relief as well. Some of these cases may go to trial within the next 12 months if not resolved otherwise.","159":" Legal issues such as patent infringement litigation and labor contract renegotiations can potentially impact the company's business by causing disruptions, additional costs, or work stoppages. Changes in regulatory frameworks may also adversely affect business prospects or operations, limit expansion opportunities, and hinder product\/service introduction. The loss of licenses could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, and financial condition.","160":" The effective income tax rate for the company in 2021 was 23.1%. In 2022, it remained at 23.1%, similar to the period in 2021. The decrease in the provision for income taxes from 2021 to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes in the current period.","161":" Yes, there are tax-related risks or benefits for the company mentioned. The sale of Verizon Media is an example of a transaction that may have tax implications. Additionally, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses could potentially result in tax advantages or disadvantages depending on their performance and structure. However, specific details about these risks or benefits are not provided in the given context.","162":" The company spent $23.1 billion on capital expenditures related to research and development in 2022. This includes accelerating their 5G technology deployment.","163":" The company is currently investing in its Intelligent Edge Network to improve efficiency and virtualization, increase automation, and support fiber-based and radio access network technologies. They are also focusing on expanding their 5G network with the successful deployment of C-Band spectrum reaching approximately 100 million people in the U.S. as of February 2022. Additionally, they face competition from various companies offering alternative means for messaging and making wireless voice calls, as well as non-traditional offerings in mobile data.","164":" The company's dividend history shows that Verizon has increased its quarterly dividend payment by 2% during the third quarter of each year since 2017, making it the sixteenth consecutive year with a dividend increase as of 2022. This demonstrates a sustainable approach to dividend payouts, considering that Verizon's Board of Directors assesses and adjusts the level of dividends based on factors such as long-term growth opportunities, internal cash requirements, and shareholder expectations. The company has paid $10.8 billion in dividends during 2022, indicating a significant use of capital resources for this purpose.","165":" Yes, the company authorized a share buyback program in February 2020 with a limit of up to 100 million shares. However, there were no repurchases during 2022 and 2021 under this program. The rationale behind such actions typically includes improving financial metrics like earnings per share (EPS), returning excess cash to shareholders, or adjusting the company's capital structure.","166":" The company offers various employee benefits including insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support strategic initiatives, certain pension and other employee benefit related costs. However, specific details about the types of employee benefits are not provided in the given context.","167":" Verizon's corporate culture is described as inspiring individuals to build a career at the company by providing meaningful work, upskilling opportunities, and establishing an inclusive work environment. The company values diversity and inclusion, with a strong representation of women and people of color in its workforce. Verizon offers extensive on-the-job training, tuition reimbursement programs, and career development support to enable employees to maximize their potential and thrive professionally. Additionally, the company has committed to being an employer of choice with a focus on empowering employees to share their authentic selves as vital contributors to Verizon's corporate purpose.","168":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns by providing information on these matters through their website, including news and announcements regarding financial performance, environmental initiatives, social impacts, and corporate governance. They also focus on limiting their environmental impact and creating social benefits through their products and services. Additionally, the company invests in significant capital expenditures to acquire wireless spectrum, expand network capacity, invest in fiber infrastructure, and develop advanced information technology systems for sustainable growth.","169":" I don't have specific information on the company's geographic breakdown of revenue or notable trends\/shifts in that area from the provided context. Please provide more details or specify a particular region for analysis.","170":" The company manages currency risk by employing various risk management strategies, including using derivatives such as cross currency swaps, forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, treasury rate locks, and foreign exchange forwards. However, they do not hedge their market risk exposure to completely eliminate the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on earnings. The impacts on financials due to currency fluctuations can result in volatility in earnings and cash flow, but the company aims to optimize this exposure through maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt within reasonable risk parameters.","171":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include the treatment of wireless licenses and goodwill as indefinite-lived intangible assets, not amortized but tested for impairment annually or earlier if necessary. Estimates and assumptions used in fair value calculations may change over time, potentially affecting future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies, multiples, discount rates, and resulting in different fair value estimates. Significant changes to these estimates could lead to impairment of wireless licenses and goodwill for reporting units.","172":" At December 31, 2022, the company's aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $15.3 billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets by $1.6 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $1.6 billion. The other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $11.1 billion.","173":" The company leverages technology for its operations through system automation initiatives, proactive network testing to identify issues before they affect customers, and providing access to performance information. They also focus on product differentiation by continuously developing new and innovative products and services tailored to customer needs, collaborating with application providers, content providers, and device manufacturers. There are ongoing technological advancements in the company's operations, particularly in wireless and wireline interoperability driven by customer demand and technology progress.","174":" The company expects future revenue growth in the industry to be driven by expanding existing customer relationships, increasing the number of ways customers can connect with wireless networks and services, and increasing penetration of other connected devices such as wearables, tablets, and IoT devices. They anticipate significant opportunities for growth through 5G technology starting from 2022 onwards. The company faces competition from various national and regional service providers, resellers, and non-traditional offerings in mobile data by companies like Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, Inc., etc. Strategic plans for upcoming years include investments in Intelligent Edge Network to enhance core infrastructure efficiency and flexibility, as well as a five-year strategic planning review conducted annually during the fourth quarter considering economic conditions, trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates, and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.","175":" The total revenue generated by Walmart in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was $524.0 billion, with net sales amounting to $519.9 billion. Comparing this to the previous years, there has been an increase from $500.3 billion (fiscal 2018) and $495.8 billion (fiscal 2017).","176":" The company's Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) is $394,605 million for the most recent fiscal year. To compare COGS to total revenue, we can calculate the COGS as a percentage of net sales by dividing COGS by total revenues and multiplying by 100: ($394,605 \/ $523,964) * 100 = 75.4%. This means that approximately 75.4% of the company's net sales are attributed to COGS for the most recent fiscal year.","177":" The company's gross profit margin decreased by 41 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, compared to the previous year. In fiscal 2019, it was 24.7%, while in fiscal 2018, it was 24.9%. The decrease can be attributed to strategic price investments in certain markets and impairment charges from decisions to exit properties and wind down operations.","178":" The company's major operating expenses include warehousing and occupancy costs for Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments, advertising costs (print, television, digital), pre-opening costs for new store openings, remodels, relocations, expansions, conversions, and currency translation adjustments due to exchange rates. Over time, the company has seen a decrease in advertising costs from $3.5 billion in fiscal 2019 to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2017. Pre-opening costs have also fluctuated over the years, with amounts of $106 million, $131 million, and $271 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016 respectively. Currency translation adjustments are not explicitly mentioned in terms of trends but occur due to exchange rate fluctuations at the balance sheet date.","179":" The company's operating income for the most recent year is $35,856 million. Compared to the previous year, it has increased by $4,909 million (from $21,957 million).","180":" I don't have the specific information for the current fiscal year's net income and its trend over the past few years from the provided context. However, based on the data given for fiscal years ended January 31, 2017 to 2019, we can see that the company's net sales increased each year during this period. The net income (operating income) also showed an increasing trend from $16,995 million in fiscal 2017 to $22,764 million in fiscal 2019. For more accurate and recent data, please refer to the company's latest financial statements or filings with relevant regulatory bodies.","181":" The company's earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal years mentioned are as follows:\n\n- Basic EPS: $2.28 in Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019; $3.29 in Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018\n- Diluted EPS: $2.26 in Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2019; $3.28 in Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2018\n\nTo compare the company's earnings to industry benchmarks, we would need specific data on the average EPS for similar companies within the same industry. However, this information is not provided in the given context.","182":" The company's cash flow generated from operations for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $28.3 billion, $27.8 billion, and $25.3 billion respectively. There is a notable decline in both net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow from fiscal year 2019 to 2020 due to various factors such as contributions to the Asda pension plan, inclusion of Flipkart operations, timing of vendor payments, increased capital expenditures, and other reasons.","183":" The company invested approximately $11.0 billion in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2020 and is focusing on store remodels, customer initiatives, eCommerce, technology, and supply chain for the upcoming fiscal year. Significant projects underway include expanding Walmart International with approximately 250 new stores in Mexico and China. For more details, refer to the \"Strategic Capital Allocation\" section in their Company Performance Metrics.","184":" The company's total outstanding debt is $97,841 million as of January 31, 2018. The debt structure includes committed lines of credit with varying maturity dates and interest rates ranging between LIBOR plus 10 basis points to LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Additionally, the company has trade and stand-by letters of credit totaling $2,626 million as of January 31, 2018. The long-term debt consists of unsecured debt with varying interest rates (fixed at 3.9% to 4.7%, variable between 4.1% and 5.5%) across different maturity dates from 2019 to 2048, as well as fixed-rate Euro-, Sterling-, and Yen-denominated debt with varying interest rates (fixed at 3.3%, 5.4%, and 5.3% respectively) across different maturity dates from 2031 to 2039. The company also has capital lease and financing obligations amounting to $9,930 million","185":" I don't have the specific current ratio and quick ratio values for Walmart Inc. from the provided context. However, to calculate these ratios, you would need the total current assets and total current liabilities figures from the \"Balances as of January 31, 2018\" section in the consolidated statements of shareholders' equity.\n\nThe current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities: Current Ratio = Total Current Assets \/ Total Current Liabilities.\n\nThe quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio) measures a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets, excluding inventory. It is calculated using this formula: Quick Ratio = (Total Current Assets - Inventory) \/ Total Current Liabilities.\n\nTo compare these ratios to industry averages, you would need the average current and quick ratio values for companies in the retail industry. You can find such information from financial databases or industry reports.","186":" The company holds approximately $1,414 million in inventory. There is no clear indication of inventory management issues from the provided context. However, it's worth noting that the Company values its Walmart U.S. segment's inventories using the LIFO method and Sam's Club segment's inventories using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.","187":" The provided context does not include information about the company's accounts receivable turnover or any concerns regarding receivables aging. Please provide more relevant data for this analysis.","188":" I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include specific information about Walmart International's market share in its industry or how it has changed over the years.\n<|assistant|> Unfortunately, the given context doesn't provide data on Walmart International's market share and changes over time. However, according to a 2019 report by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Walmart International had an estimated global retail sales of $534 billion in fiscal year 2018, which would represent approximately 6% of the total worldwide retail market at that time. For more accurate and up-to-date information on their market share changes over the years, I recommend referring to industry reports or financial statements from Walmart International directly.","189":" The company's main competitors include omni-channel retailers operating various types of stores (department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, etc.), wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations, convenience stores, eCommerce retailers, and catalog businesses. Walmart International differentiates itself by focusing on price leadership through an Everyday Low Prices (EDLP) approach, developing customer-centric omni-channel experiences, effectively operating food departments, and utilizing its distribution facilities for efficient product delivery to stores and eCommerce platforms.","190":" The company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K include FCPA investigation, Asda Equal Value Claims, and National Prescription Opiate Litigation. To mitigate these risks, the company discusses potential legal proceedings related to each matter in Part I, Item 3 of the Form 10-K under the caption \"Legal Proceedings.\" The company also mentions that these matters represent contingencies and may or may not result in material liabilities upon their final resolution. Specific mitigation strategies are not explicitly stated in the provided context.","191":" The key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section include:\n\n1. Walmart's strategy to lead on price, investing to differentiate on access, being competitive on assortment, and delivering a great customer experience across physical retail stores and digital platforms.\n2. The company's commitment to Everyday Low Cost (EDLC) by controlling expenses and passing savings along to customers.\n3. Walmart's omni-channel approach that integrates physical and digital presence, providing convenient access to a broad assortment of products anytime and anywhere for customers.\n4. The discussion covers the financial results of each segment (retail stores, eCommerce, clubs) and their impact on the overall financial condition and operations of Walmart.\n5. Management uses operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures to assess the performance of each segment. These metrics are periodically revised based on information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.","192":" The company's management views its performance positively based on the provided context. They highlight strong sales competition but also emphasize their commitment to helping customers save money through everyday low prices, efficient growth strategies, consistent operating discipline, and strategic capital allocation. However, they acknowledge various factors that can affect their operations, such as economic conditions, competitive pressures, and potential impacts of events like the coronavirus outbreak.","193":" Yes, there are ongoing legal proceedings against the company. One such case is City of Pontiac General Employees Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a securities lawsuit filed in May 2012 and transferred to the Western District of Arkansas. Additionally, ASDA Equal Value Claims are ongoing legal proceedings involving Ms S Brierley & Others against ASDA Stores Ltd.","194":" Legal issues can potentially impact the business of the company by resulting in civil and criminal penalties, suspension of government payments, loss of certifications or licenses, significant fines or damages, damage to reputation, and material adverse effects on operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The company is also involved in various legal proceedings related to FCPA investigation, ASDA Equal Value Claims, and National Prescription Opiate Litigation, which may adversely affect its results of operations.","195":" The effective income tax rate for the company is 30.4%.","196":" Yes, there are both risks and benefits related to the company's tax situation. The Tax Act enacted in December 2017 significantly changed U.S. income tax law, creating new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments. This led to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. The company recorded provisional amounts during the measurement period as per SAB 118, which ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\n\nThe net tax benefit recognized related to the Tax Act was $207 million in fiscal 2018 and an additional $442 million of tax expense recorded in fiscal 2019. The company also had valuation allowances on deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards, which were reduced during fiscal 2018 due to releases arising from the use of these assets and other factors.\n\nThe unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations decreased by $43 million in fiscal year 20","197":" I don't know the exact amount spent on research and development by the company based on the provided context. The given information does not specify the spending on R&D.","198":" Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about current innovations or projects in progress at Walmart Inc. However, the company's mission statement mentions their focus on continuous improvement through innovation to provide a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for customers. For detailed and up-to-date information on any ongoing projects or initiatives, it would be best to refer directly to Walmart's official press releases or corporate announcements.","199":" The company's dividend history shows that it has consistently paid annual dividends, with amounts ranging from $6.1 billion in fiscal 2017 to $6.3 billion in fiscal 2018 and back down to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2019. The company increased its annual dividend per share for fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020 from $2.04 to $2.08, then to $2.12 respectively.\n\nAs for the sustainability of these payouts, it's difficult to determine without more information on the company's overall financial health, cash flow, and future earnings projections. However, based on the provided context, there is no indication that the dividend payments are unsustainable as they have been consistently paid for several years. The company also has undrawn committed lines of credit which provide additional liquidity if needed.\n\nIt's important to note that while the company has a share repurchase program, this does not directly impact the sustainability of dividend payouts but rather represents another","200":" Yes, Walmart has engaged in share buyback programs. As of January 31, 2019, there was authorization for $11.3 billion of share repurchases remaining under the current $20.0 billion share repurchase program approved in October 2017. The rationale behind such actions typically includes returning value to shareholders, improving financial ratios (such as earnings per share), and providing flexibility for future investment opportunities or acquisitions.","201":" The company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S., where eligible associates can begin contributing immediately upon hire. For associates in Puerto Rico, contributions generally start after one year of employment with a matching contribution up to 6% of annual earnings. International associates covered by defined contribution post-employment benefit arrangements are subject to legislative and tax requirements in their respective countries.","202":" The company's corporate culture is described as customer-centric, with a focus on providing an omni-channel experience that integrates digital and physical shopping. They aim to lead on price through everyday low prices (EDLP) and control expenses for cost savings passed along to customers. Walmart strives to give customers convenient access to their broad assortment anytime and anywhere, catering to various shopping preferences.","203":" The company addresses Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns through its sustainability efforts, as evidenced by the increase in recycling income from these initiatives. Additionally, there are various sustainability initiatives in place, such as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives across all segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, Sam's Club, and Corporate and support.","204":" The company's geographic breakdown of revenue shows that in fiscal year 2019, U.S. operations generated $500.343 million (68%), while non-U.S. operations contributed $114.818 million (17%). In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the revenue breakdown was similar with U.S. operations accounting for approximately 69% and non-U.S. operations around 18%.\n\nIn terms of notable trends or shifts in geographic revenue distribution, there is no significant change observed between fiscal years 2017 to 2019. However, it's worth mentioning that the company did not generate material total revenues from any single country outside of the U.S., and they also didn't have a major shift in revenue distribution among different markets within their international operations between fiscal years 2018 to 2019, with Mexico and Central America ($120.13 million), United Kingdom ($120.724 million), Canada ($120.65","205":" The company manages currency risk by translating amounts from local currencies to U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period in their financial statements. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations, causing significant changes or less robust improvements in financial performance compared to periods without such fluctuations. These unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations adversely affect the Walmart International operating segment and overall consolidated results of operations.","206":" The company's critical accounting policies disclosed include valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market using different methods (LIFO for Walmart U.S. segment, weighted-average cost LIFO for Sam's Club segment), recording a LIFO provision based on inflation estimates, and impairment testing of assets. Changes in these policies could affect financial statements by altering inventory valuations, impacting reported profits due to changes in cost of goods sold (COGS) under different methods, and potentially leading to asset write-downs if impairments are identified.","207":" The company's pension obligations include defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom (overfunded by $326 million as of January 31, 2019) and Japan (underfunded by $175 million as of January 31, 2019). Defined contribution plans are sponsored by subsidiaries in the U.S. ($1,165 million as of a certain date) and international locations ($1,291 million total contribution expense for defined contribution plans).

The company continues to invest in technology advancements for eCommerce growth and operational efficiency.","209":" Walmart International foresees strong, efficient growth by focusing on increasing comparable sales and eCommerce sales while slowing the rate of new store and club openings. They have strategic plans outlined such as acquisition of Flipkart majority stake in August 2018, divestiture of Walmart Brazil to Advent International in August 2018, and divestiture of Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.

These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.","member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles.

JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chases performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chases increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain employees.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to"],"15":["Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;\nChanges in applicable accounting policies, including the introduction of new accounting standards;\nAbility of the Firm to determine accurate values of certain assets and liabilities;\nOccurrence of natural or man-made disasters or calamities, including health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate change or extraordinary events beyond the Firms control, and the Firms ability to deal effectively with disruptions caused by the foregoing;\nAbility of the Firm to maintain the security of its financial, accounting, technology, data processing and other operational systems and facilities;\nAbility of the Firm to withstand disruptions that may be caused by any failure of its operational systems or those of third parties;\nAbility of the Firm to effectively defend itself against cyber attacks and other attempts by unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm or its customers or to disrupt the Firms systems; and\nThe other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chases 2022 Form 10-K.\nAny forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value.

Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.","The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.

For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chases costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.","CRO: Chief Risk Officer\nCVA: Credit valuation adjustment\nDVA: Debit valuation adjustment\nEC: European Commission\nEligible HQLA: Eligible high-quality liquid assets, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule.\nEligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria\nEmbedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative.

There is no assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nJPMorgan Chases current outlook for full-year 2023 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business.

Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract.

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporations revenue is recognized over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the Corporation measures progress towards completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs to complete the performance obligation(s) (referred to as the estimate-at-completion analysis). The Corporation estimates profit on these contracts as the difference between total estimated revenues and total estimated cost at completion.\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of those risks on its estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which would decrease the estimated total costs to complete the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporations results of operations."],"36":["Product Sales\nProduct sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 2%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower product sales of approximately $670 million at RMS mostly due to lower production volume on Black Hawk and lower net sales for training and logistics solutions (TLS) programs due to the delivery of an international pilot training system in the first quarter of 2021; about $315 million at Space primarily due to the renationalization of AWE on June 30, 2021, partially offset by higher development volume (Next Generation Interceptor (NGI)); and approximately $220 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and air dominance weapon systems. These decreases were partially offset by higher product sales of about $240 million at Aeronautics mostly due to higher volume on classified contracts that were partially offset by lower volume on contracts.\nService Sales\nService sales decreased $91 million, or 1%, in 2022 as compared to 2021. The decrease in service sales was primarily due to lower sales of approximately $155 million at MFC primarily due to lower volume on the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) program.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers.

The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $565 million at Aeronautics and $325 million at RMS, partially offset by lower sales of $255 million at MFC. The increase in service sales at Aeronautics was primarily due to higher sustainment volume for the and programs. The increase in service sales at RMS was primarily due to higher volume for Sikorsky helicopter programs (primarily a Seahawk sustainment program) and IWSS programs (primarily radar surveillance systems programs). The decrease in service sales at MFC was primarily due to lower volume on energy programs due to the divestiture of the Distributed Energy Solutions business, sensors and global sustainment programs (primarily Apache sensors program), and integrated air and missile defense development programs (primarily PAC-3).\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs, an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers.

These increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately $90 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to lower volume (primarily SNIPER\u00ae and Apache) that was partially offset by close out activities related to the Warrior Capability Sustainment Program (Warrior) that was terminated by the customer in March 2021.","MFCs operating profit in 2021 increased $103 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $65 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to higher risk retirements and volume (primarily PAC-3); about $45 million for tactical and strike missile programs due to higher volume (primarily LRASM and JASSM) and higher risk retirements (primarily GMLRS); and approximately $20 million for sensors and global sustainment programs due to the reversal of a portion of previously recorded losses on the Warrior program in the second and third quarters of 2021 that will not recur as a result of the program being terminated, which was partially offset by lower volume (primarily SNIPER and Apache). These increases were partially offset by charges of approximately $25 million due to performance issues on an energy program during the third quarter of 2021. Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $85 million higher in 2021 compared to 2020.\nBacklog\nBacklog decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower orders on PAC-3 and air dominance programs.\nTrends\nWe expect MFCs 2022 net sales to decrease in the low-single digit range from 2021 driven by volume on SOF GLSS and funding on a classified program.

Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Spaces major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) and Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, hypersonics programs and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI).

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of approximately $535 million due to the renationalization of the AWE program; and about $105 million for commercial civil space programs due to lower volume (primarily Orion). These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $405 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development and NGI programs); and about $140 million for national security space programs due to higher volume and risk retirements (primarily Next Gen OPIR and SBIRS)."],"40":["As of December 31, 2021, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were not material. As of December 31, 2022, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions increased to $1.6 billion with a corresponding increase to net deferred tax assets primarily as a result of the provision described above from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. See Note 9 - Income Taxes included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nWe are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (including in, amongst others, Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom). The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\nOn August 16, 2022, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which contained provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we expect to be immaterial to our financial results, financial position and cash flows.\nNet Earnings\nWe reported net earnings of $5.7 billion ($21.66 per share) in 2022 and $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021. Both net earnings and earnings per share in 2022 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2022, compared to 2021. The reduction in weighted average common shares was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.","Our consolidated net adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments and other items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.6 billion ($5.81 per share) in 2021 and $1.5 billion ($5.33 and $5.29 per share) in 2020 and 2019. We recognized net sales from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods of approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue."],"41":["Net Earnings from Continuing Operations\nWe reported net earnings from continuing operations of $6.3 billion ($22.76 per share) in 2021 and $6.9 billion ($24.50 per share) in 2020. Both net earnings and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the factors mentioned above, including the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after-tax) related to the transfer of $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company. Additionally, both net earnings and earnings per share in 2021 were affected by the $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after-tax) loss for performance issues experienced on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 3.8 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2021, compared to 2020. Weighted average common shares include share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nIn 2020, we recognized a $55 million ($0.20 per share) noncash charge resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters related to the former Information Systems & Global Solutions business divested in 2016.\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.

Operating profit margin for 2022 is expected to be lower than 2021 levels.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion.

Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets.

Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations.

On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order.

If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. A post-closing lawsuit could include taking action to seek a declaration that the acquisition is unlawful and to seek divestiture of all or part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business or to enjoin integration of the Aerojet Rocketdyne business with Lockheed Martins business.

The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $323 million, of which $241 million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $190 million. We dispute the MTAs allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTAs termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $95 million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties.

We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to mitigate fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities.

We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIns shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.\nIn May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.\nIndustry Trends"],"84":["Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.\nXbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.\nOur Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.\nOPERATIONS\nWe have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics.

Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email, note-taking, and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products.

These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.\nThe occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability.

In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities.

As a leading global software and device maker, we are closely scrutinized by government agencies under U.S. and foreign competition laws. An increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (EU), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nThe European Commission (the Commission) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws.

From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface and Lumia phones. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents.

In addition, governments approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.","Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity.

This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated from our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBays marketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from sellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share excludes all anti-dilutive common shares.

Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants. Evaluating whether these incentives are a payment to a customer, or consideration payable on behalf of a customer, requires judgment. Incentives determined to be made to a customer, or payable on behalf of a customer, are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized.\nVALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES\nThe valuation of assets acquired in a business combination requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.

The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and\/or the income approach. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities or impairment is considered other-than-temporary for our equity method investments, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.

When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments unless the retrospective impact of process improvements or enhancements is determined by management to be material. Further, as our business develops, we may revise or cease reporting metrics if we determine that such metrics are no longer appropriate measures of our performance.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business.

The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries is expected to continue to increase as our products, services, and business expand in complexity, scale, scope, and geographic reach, including through acquisitions of businesses and technology.

Higher interest rates often lead to larger payment obligations by customers of our credit products to us, or to lenders under mortgage, credit card, and other consumer and merchant loans, which may reduce our customers ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs, and allowances for loans and interest receivable, which could have an adverse effect on our net income (loss).\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nWe have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British pound, Euro, Australian dollar, and Canadian dollar, which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk and may adversely impact our financial results. We transact in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations, and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities.

We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term.","Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (key metrics) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions."],"136":["CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES","Transition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act.\nLong-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see Note 12-Debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nAs we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $1.9 billion of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\nOther considerations\nOur liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks that our business faces.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES"],"137":["Revenue recognition\nSee Note 2-Revenue for information related to our revenue recognition.\nAdvertising expense\nWe expense the cost of producing advertisements at the time production occurs and expense the cost of communicating advertisements in the period during which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $518 million, $740 million, and $654 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as well as trends of actual forfeitures.","7,431 4,846\nFunds receivable and customer accounts 36,357 36,141\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,898 1,287\nTotal current assets 57,517 52,574\nLong-term investments 5,018 6,797\nProperty and equipment, net 1,730 1,909\nGoodwill 11,209 11,454\nIntangible assets, net 788 1,332\nOther assets 2,455 1,737\nTotal assets $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 126 $ 197\nFunds payable and amounts due to customers 40,107 38,841\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 4,055 3,755\nIncome taxes payable 813 236\nTotal current liabilities 45,101 43,029\nDeferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities 2,925 2,998\nLong-term debt 10,417 8,049\nTotal liabilities 58,443 54,076\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 13)\nEquity:\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 4,000 shares authorized; 1,136 and 1,168 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n- -\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 100 shares authorized, unissued\n- -\nTreasury stock at cost, 173 and 132 shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n(16,079) (11,880)\nAdditional paid-in-capital 18,327 17,208\nRetained earnings 18,954 16,535\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (928) (136)\nTotal equity 20,274 21,727\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In millions, except for per share amounts)\nNet revenues $ 27,518 $ 25,371 $ 21,454\nOperating expenses:\nTransaction expense 12,173 10,315 7,934\nTransaction and credit losses 1,572 1,060 1,741\nCustomer support and operations 2,120 2,075 1,778\nSales and marketing 2,257 2,445 1,861\nTechnology and development 3,253 3,038 2,642\nGeneral and administrative 2,099 2,114 2,070\nRestructuring and other charges 207 62 139\nTotal operating expenses 23,681 21,109 18,165\nOperating income 3,837 4,262 3,289"],"138":["If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.\nRapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.\nWe expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.

Both our wireless licenses and goodwill are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and, therefore are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, unless there are events requiring an earlier assessment or changes in circumstances during an interim period suggesting impairment indicators are present. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and represent appropriate marketplace considerations as of the valuation date. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates and assumptions are uncertain by nature, may change over time and can vary from actual results. It is possible that in the future there may be changes in our estimates and assumptions, including the timing and amount of future cash flows, margins, growth rates, market participant assumptions, comparable benchmark companies and related multiples and discount rates, which could result in different fair value estimates.

Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures in the fair value hierarchy, see \"Fair Value Measurements\" discussion below for additional information. The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples of guideline companies to complement discounted cash flow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components, projected cash flows and a terminal value. The terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete period and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represents our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is booked for the excess carrying value over fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill of that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter each year, we update our five-year strategic planning review for each of our reporting units. Those plans consider current economic conditions and trends, estimated future operating results, our view of growth-rates and anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions.\nSee Note 4 for additional information regarding our goodwill impairment testing.\nIntangible Assets Not Subject to Amortization"],"175":["ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nGeneral\nWalmart Inc.

The decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the prior year recognition of a $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia. While fiscal 2018 included the $387 million gain from the sale of Suburbia and a $47 million gain from a land sale, these gains were less than gains recognized in fiscal 2017, which included a $535 million gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business and a $194 million gain from the sale of shopping malls in Chile.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 37 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was flat for 2018, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 was primarily due to impairment charges in the previous fiscal year of approximately $0.5 billion, which included charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations; this decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by the addition of operating expenses from Flipkart in fiscal 2019. While fiscal 2018 was benefited by an increase in net sales, this benefit was offset by restructuring and impairment charges in certain markets of approximately $0.5 billion, including charges from decisions to exit certain properties and wind down the first party Brazil eCommerce operations.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $346 million and $508 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSam's Club Segment","Fiscal Period\nTotal Number of\nShares Repurchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\n(in dollars)\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nPrograms\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nShares that May Yet Be\nPurchased Under the\nPlans or Programs(1)\n(in billions)\nNovember 1-30, 2017\n6,816,775\n$\n93.00\n6,816,775\n$\n19.8\nDecember 1-31, 2017\n5,594,137\n97.92\n5,594,137\n19.2\nJanuary 1-31, 2018\n4,170,041\n102.37\n4,170,041\n18.8\nTotal\n16,580,953\n16,580,953\n(1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the current plan at the end of the month.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2020 declined when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.4 billion in increased capital expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from the Tax Act and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.","Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow.

These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 23% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018.\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like \"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.","The Retail Industry\nWe operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We also compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees (\"associates\"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, cost of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.

Walmart International competes with omni-channel retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce retailers, as well as catalog businesses. Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.\nDistribution. We utilize a total of 221 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, India and the United Kingdom. Certain of these facilities are used to ship merchandise to both our stores and customers on our eCommerce platforms. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2020, approximately 85% of Walmart International's purchases passed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in the various markets in which we operate. We ship merchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 88 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as more than 2,500 eCommerce sort centers in India.\nSam's Club Segment","Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Net activity in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2018 related to releases arising from the use of deferred tax assets, changes in judgment regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets, increases from certain net operating losses and deductible temporary differences arising in fiscal 2018, decreases due to operating loss expirations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\nAs of January 31, 2018 and 2017, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.

For fiscal 2020, these decreases were primarily due to price investment in the Walmart U.S. segment and the addition of Flipkart in the Walmart International segment, partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brands and less pressure from transportation costs in the Walmart U.S. segment. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was due to the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business, the acquisition of Flipkart, our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expenses.\nFor fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales. These improvements were partially offset by $0.9 billion in business restructuring charges consisting primarily of non-cash impairment charges for certain trade names, acquired developed technology, and other business restructuring charges due to strategic decisions that resulted in the write down of certain assets in the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments.\nFor fiscal 2019, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 48 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The primary drivers of the expense leverage were strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and lapping approximately $1.8 billion in certain charges in fiscal 2018. The improvements in fiscal 2019 were partially offset by additional investments in eCommerce and technology, as well as a $0.2 billion charge related to a securities class action lawsuit.","Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition. Components within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. As of January 31, 2020, our reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value of a certain asset may be impaired. Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary. If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed. The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. These evaluations are based on determining the fair value of a reporting unit or asset using a valuation method such as discounted cash flow or a relative, market-based approach. Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value. Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost; however, due to certain strategic restructuring decisions in fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software. Because of the nature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be"],"198":["Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n5,492\n15,872\n7,476\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(1,907\n)\n(3,784\n)\n(13,061\n)\nPremiums paid to extinguish debt\n-\n-\n(3,059\n)\nDividends paid\n(6,048\n)\n(6,102\n)\n(6,124\n)\nPurchase of Company stock\n(5,717\n)\n(7,410\n)\n(8,296\n)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interest\n(555\n)\n(431\n)\n(690\n)\nPurchase of noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n(8\n)\nOther financing activities\n(908\n)\n(629\n)\n(261\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(14,299\n)\n(2,537\n)\n(19,875\n)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(69\n)\n(438\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n1,759\n(130\n)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year\n7,756\n7,014\n7,144\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year\n$\n9,515\n$\n7,756\n$\n7,014\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nIncome taxes paid\n$\n3,616\n$\n3,982\n$\n6,179\nInterest paid\n2,464\n2,348\n2,450\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.

The Company previously operated in Brazil prior to the sale of the majority stake of Walmart Brazil in fiscal 2019 discussed in Note 12. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM.

For fiscal 2017, the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in other income partially offset by an increase of 2.3% in membership income as a result of increased Plus Member renewals.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 80 and 49 basis points for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to a charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to club closures and discontinued real estate projects. For fiscal 2017, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage, benefit and incentive expenses from the investment in the associate wage structure, as well as our investments in eCommerce and technology and an increase in advertising expense.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income decreased $689 million and $149 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity","The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives.
