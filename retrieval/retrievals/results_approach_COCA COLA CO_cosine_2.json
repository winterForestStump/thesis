When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable","type":"Document"},"23":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-22","period_of_report":"2021-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134422000009\/ko-20211231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.htm"},"page_content":"Trade Accounts Receivable\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.

In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2022_0000021344-23-000011.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-21","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134423000011\/ko-20221231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2022_0000021344-23-000011.htm"},"page_content":"- 19 -\nNet income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company 9,542 9,771 7,747\nDividends (per share - $1.76, $1.68 and $1.64 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n(7,617) (7,251) (7,047)\nBalance at end of year 71,019 69,094 66,555\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nBalance at beginning of year (14,330) (14,601) (13,544)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (565) 271 (1,057)\nBalance at end of year (14,895) (14,330) (14,601)\nTreasury Stock\nBalance at beginning of year (51,641) (52,016) (52,244)\nTreasury stock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 376 375 228\nPurchases of stock for treasury (1,336) - -\nBalance at end of year (52,601) (51,641) (52,016)\nTotal Equity Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company $ 24,105 $ 22,999 $ 19,299\nEquity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nBalance at beginning of year $ 1,861 $ 1,985 $ 2,117\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 29 33 21\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments (118) (132) (153)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interests (51) (43) (18)\nContributions by noncontrolling interests - 20 17\nOther activities - (2) 1\nTotal Equity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests $ 1,721 $ 1,861 $ 1,985\n1 Represents the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2021.\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business","type":"Document"},"61":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-22","period_of_report":"2021-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134422000009\/ko-20211231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.htm"},"page_content":"Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company.
