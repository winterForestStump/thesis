Equity and other investments were $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.","type":"Document"},"18":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"(10\n)\n(81\n)\n(2\n)\nTotal\n$\n(98\n)\n$\n(57\n)\n$\nNet recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nNet realized gains on investments sold\n$\n$\n$\nNet unrealized gains on investments still held\n1,057\nImpairments of investments\n(20\n)\n(20\n)\n(11\n)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n1,169\nPART II\nItem 8\nNOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS\nInvestment Components\nThe components of investments were as follows:\n(In millions)\nFair Value\nLevel\nAdjusted\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nRecorded\nBasis\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nEquity\nInvestments\nJune 30, 2023\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income\nCommercial paper\nLevel 2\n$\n16,589\n$\n$\n$\n16,589\n$\n12,231\n$\n4,358\n$\nCertificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n2,701\n2,701\n2,657\nU.S. government securities\nLevel 1\n65,237\n(3,870\n)\n61,369\n2,991\n58,378\nU.S. agency securities\nLevel 2\n2,703\n2,703\n1,809\nForeign government bonds\nLevel 2\n(24\n)\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n(39\n)\nCorporate notes and bonds\nLevel 2\n10,809\n(583\n)\n10,234\n10,234\nCorporate notes and bonds\nLevel 3\nMunicipal securities\nLevel 2\n(18\n)\nMunicipal securities\nLevel 3\n(16\n)\nTotal debt investments\n$\n99,869\n$\n$\n(4,550\n)\n$\n95,332\n$\n18,780\n$\n76,552\n$\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income\nEquity investments\nLevel 1\n$\n10,138\n$\n7,446\n$\n$\n2,692\nEquity investments\nOther\n7,187\n7,187\nTotal equity investments\n$\n17,325\n$\n7,446\n$\n$\n9,879\nCash\n$\n8,478\n$\n8,478\n$\n$\nDerivatives, net (a)\nTotal\n$\n121,141\n$\n34,704\n$\n76,558\n$\n9,879\nPART II\nItem 8\n(In millions)\nFair Value\nLevel\nAdjusted\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nRecorded\nBasis\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nEquity\nInvestments\nJune 30, 2022\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income\nCommercial paper\nLevel 2\n$\n2,500\n$\n$\n$\n2,500\n$\n2,498\n$\n$\nCertificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n2,071\n2,071\n2,032\nU.S. government securities\nLevel 1\n79,696\n(2,178\n)\n77,547\n77,538\nU.S. agency securities\nLevel 2\n(9\n)\nForeign government bonds\nLevel 2","type":"Document"},"19":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (SA) and cloud services.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nPART II\nItem

While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements.

An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nPART II\nItem 7\nIncome Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors.

Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2016-07-28","period_of_report":"2016-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000119312516662209\/d187868d10k.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.htm"},"page_content":"(238 )\n(35 )\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on investments (net of tax effects of $(121), $(197), and $936)\n(228 )\n(362 )\n1,737\nTranslation adjustments and other (net of tax effects of $(33), $16, and $12)\n(519 )\n(1,383 )\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(985 )\n(1,186 )\n1,965\nComprehensive income\n$ 15,813\n$ 11,007\n$ 24,039\nSee accompanying notes.\nPART II\nItem 8\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\nJune 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 6,510\n$ 5,595\nShort-term investments (including securities loaned of $204 and $75)\n106,730\n90,931\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\n113,240\n96,526\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $426 and $335\n18,277\n17,908\nInventories\n2,251\n2,902\nOther\n5,892\n5,461\nTotal current assets\n139,660\n122,797\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $19,800 and $17,606\n18,356\n14,731\nEquity and other investments\n10,431\n12,053\nGoodwill\n17,872\n16,939\nIntangible assets, net\n3,733\n4,835\nOther long-term assets\n3,642\n3,117\nTotal assets\n$ 193,694\n$ 174,472\nLiabilities and stockholders equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 6,898\n$ 6,591\nShort-term debt\n12,904\n4,985\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n2,499\nAccrued compensation\n5,264\n5,096\nIncome taxes\nShort-term unearned revenue\n27,468\n23,223\nSecurities lending payable\nOther\n5,949\n6,555\nTotal current liabilities\n59,357\n49,647\nLong-term debt\n40,783\n27,808\nLong-term unearned revenue\n6,441\n2,095\nDeferred income taxes\n1,476\n1,295\nOther long-term liabilities\n13,640\n13,544\nTotal liabilities\n121,697\n94,389\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders equity:\nCommon stock and paid-in capital - shares authorized 24,000;

We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters.\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\nThe Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.
