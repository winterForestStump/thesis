In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.\nEffect of Hypothetical 1% Fluctuation in LIBOR and CDOR:\nBased on our current variable rate debt balance as of December 28, 2019, a hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR and CDOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.

Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include Kraft Heinz and all of our controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nReportable Segments\nWe manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as Rest of World. Rest of World comprises two operating segments: Latin America and Asia Pacific (APAC).\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, certain organizational changes were announced that will impact our future internal reporting and reportable segments. As a result of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a reportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the United States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain. These changes will be effective in the first quarter of 2020.\nUse of Estimates","type":"Document"},"48":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"10.21\nAddendum to Separation Agreement and General Release, dated as of June 30, 2019, by and between The Kraft Heinz Company and Bernardo Hees (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.4 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on August 13, 2019).+\n10.22\nOffer of Employment Letter, dated as of July 1, 2019, by and between The Kraft Heinz Company and Miguel Patricio (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on August 13, 2019).+\n10.23\nOffer of Continued Employment Letter, dated as of September 6, 2019, by and between The Kraft Heinz Company and George Zoghbi (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.2 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on October 31, 2019).+\n10.24\nSeparation Agreement and General Release, dated as of December 20, 2019, by and between The Kraft Heinz Company and David Knopf.+*\n10.25\nForm of Amended and Restated The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.3 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on October 31, 2019).+\n10.26\nForm of Amended and Restated The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.4 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on October 31, 2019).+\n10.27\nForm of Amended and Restated The Kraft Heinz Company 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2019 Performance Share Award Notice (incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.5 to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (File No. 1-37482), filed on October 31, 2019).+\n21.1\nList of subsidiaries of The Kraft Heinz Company.*\n23.1\nConsent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.*\n24.1\nPower of Attorney.*\n31.1\nCertification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a 14(a)\/15d 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.*\n31.2","type":"Document"},"49":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"Item 1.

are exposed to market risks from adverse changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices:","type":"Document"},"57":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"Divestiture Hedging:\nWe entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the Heinz India Transaction.

In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.\nEffect of Hypothetical 1% Fluctuation in LIBOR and CDOR:\nBased on our current variable rate debt balance as of December 28, 2019, a hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR and CDOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.
