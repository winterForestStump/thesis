For fiscal 2018, the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.","type":"Document"},"8":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-03-28","period_of_report":"2019-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416919000016\/wmtform10-kx1312019.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.htm"},"page_content":"(2)\nUnit counts related to discontinued operations have been removed from all relevant periods.

We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.\nManagement measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. In fiscal 2019, the Company revised certain of its corporate overhead allocations, including depreciation expense, to the operating segments and, accordingly, revised prior period amounts for comparability.","type":"Document"},"9":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-03-28","period_of_report":"2019-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416919000016\/wmtform10-kx1312019.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.htm"},"page_content":"Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019, 30.4% for fiscal 2018, and 30.3% for fiscal 2017. Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate. The reconciliation from the U.S. statutory rate to the effective income tax rates for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 is presented in Note 9 in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $7.2 billion and $10.5 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, which represents a decrease of $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.

The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.\nWhen necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 and 2017, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.","type":"Document"},"23":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-03-28","period_of_report":"2019-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416919000016\/wmtform10-kx1312019.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.htm"},"page_content":"MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket for Common Stock\nWalmart's common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, which is the primary market for Walmart's common stock.

The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of shareholders who purchased or acquired stock of the Company between December 8, 2011, and April 20, 2012, and seeks damages and other relief based on allegations that the defendants' conduct affected the value of such stock. On September 20, 2016, the court granted plaintiff's motion for class certification. On October 6, 2016, the defendants filed a petition to appeal the class certification ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On November 7, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit denied the Company's petition.\nIn addition, a number of derivative complaints have been filed in Delaware and Arkansas, also tracking the allegations of the Times story, and naming various current and former directors and certain former officers as additional defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants who are or were directors or officers of the Company breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of FCPA compliance.
