For Lunchables, the reduction in fair value was also due to lower forecasted net sales and royalty rate assumptions associated with lower profit margin expectations driven by pricing actions at certain customers. For Velveeta, Philadelphia, and Cool Whip, no assumption changes other than the discount rate had a meaningful impact on the estimated fair value of brands. Since these valuation assumption changes were made in connection with the annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2019 and were not indicative of events or conditions that would have constituted a triggering event during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded the non-cash impairment loss in the second quarter of 2019. These brands had an aggregate carrying value of $13.5 billion prior to this impairment and $13.0 billion after impairment.\nThe aggregate carrying amount associated with an additional three brands (Kraft, Planters, and ABC), which each had excess fair value over its carrying amount of 10% or less, was $13.4 billion as of the annual impairment test date. The aggregate carrying amount of an additional three brands (Oscar Mayer, Jet Puffed, and Quero), which each had fair value over its carrying amount of between 10-20%, was $3.6 billion as of the annual impairment test date.

This decrease was primarily related to the $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes and second lien senior secured notes that were validly tendered in September 2019, the redemption of approximately $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes in October 2019, and the repayment of $350 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in August 2019. These decreases to long-term debt were partially offset by the $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued in September 2019. We used the proceeds from the issuance of these senior notes, together with cash on hand, to fund our tender offers in September 2019 and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith, and to fund the partial redemption of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of our 2.800% senior notes due July 2020 and 300 million Canadian dollar senior notes due July 2020.","type":"Document"},"16":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"(6,044\n)\n-\nPrepaid expenses\n-\n-\nOther current assets\n-\n-\nAssets held for sale\n-\n-\nTotal current assets\n-\n7,293\n8,975\n(8,171\n)\n8,097\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n-\n4,420\n2,635\n-\n7,055\nGoodwill\n-\n11,066\n24,480\n-\n35,546\nInvestments in subsidiaries\n51,623\n66,492\n-\n(118,115\n)\n-\nIntangible assets, net\n-\n2,860\n45,792\n-\n48,652\nLong-term lending due from affiliates\n-\n2,000\n(2,207\n)\n-\nOther non-current assets\n-\n1,250\n-\n2,100\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n51,623\n$\n93,188\n$\n85,132\n$\n(128,493\n)\n$\n101,450\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCommercial paper and other short-term debt\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n-\n-\n1,022\nShort-term lending due to affiliates\n-\n4,645\n1,399\n(6,044\n)\n-\nTrade payables\n-\n2,445\n1,558\n-\n4,003\nPayables due to affiliates\n-\n(1,426\n)\n-\nAccrued marketing\n-\n-\nInterest payable\n-\n-\nOther current liabilities\n-\n2,239\n(701\n)\n1,804\nLiabilities held for sale\n-\n-\n-\nTotal current liabilities\n-\n9,401\n6,645\n(8,171\n)\n7,875\nLong-term debt\n-\n27,912\n-\n28,216\nLong-term borrowings due to affiliates\n-\n2,000\n(2,207\n)\n-\nDeferred income taxes\n-\n1,307\n10,571\n-\n11,878\nAccrued postemployment costs\n-\n-\nOther non-current liabilities\n-\n-\n1,459\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n-\n41,565\n18,514\n(10,378\n)\n49,701\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal shareholders equity\n51,623\n51,623\n66,492\n(118,115\n)\n51,623\nNoncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n-\nTOTAL EQUITY\n51,623\n51,623\n66,618\n(118,115\n)\n51,749\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY\n$\n51,623\n$\n93,188\n$\n85,132\n$\n(128,493\n)\n$\n101,450\nThe Kraft Heinz Company\nCondensed Consolidating Balance Sheets\nAs of December 29, 2018\n(in millions)\nParent Guarantor\nSubsidiary Issuer\nNon-Guarantor Subsidiaries\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n1,130\nTrade receivables, net\n-\n1,196\n-\n2,129\nReceivables due from affiliates\n-\n(1,211\n)\n-\nIncome taxes receivable\n-\n(558\n)\nInventories\n-\n1,783\n-\n2,667\nShort-term lending due from affiliates\n-\n1,787\n3,753\n(5,540\n)\n-\nPrepaid expenses\n-\n-\nOther current assets\n-\n-\n1,221\nAssets held for sale\n-\n1,301\n-\n1,376","type":"Document"},"17":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"Other expense\/(income) was $168 million of income in 2018 compared to $627 million of income in 2017.

These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives.\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts.

We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement.

Organic Net Sales decreased 0.1% to $2.8 billion in 2019 compared to $2.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (1.2 pp). Unfavorable volume\/mix was due to ongoing weakness in infant nutrition, partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases in Brazil and Mexico.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 42.8% to $363 million in 2019 compared to $635 million in 2018, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (22.6 pp, including 20.8 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and costs not expected to repeat, from a combination of higher labor-related expenses from the impact of the Holidays Act in New Zealand, as well as asset- and inventory-related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America.
