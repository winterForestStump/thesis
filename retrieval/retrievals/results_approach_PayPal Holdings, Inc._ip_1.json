This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated from our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBays marketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from sellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021.

The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance.

In May 2020, we repaid the $3.0 billion using proceeds from the May 2020 debt issuance. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. The total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Credit Agreement was approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPaidy credit agreement\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Paidy Credit Agreement) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0 billion. In September 2022, the Paidy Credit Agreement was modified to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $686 million as of December 31, 2022.) Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging from 0.40% to 0.60%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.","type":"Document"},"18":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1633917_10K_2022_0001633917-23-000033.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1633917","company":"PayPal Holdings, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-10","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1633917\/000163391723000033\/pypl-20221231.htm","filename":"1633917_10K_2022_0001633917-23-000033.htm"},"page_content":"Consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to the partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.","type":"Document"},"33":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1633917_10K_2022_0001633917-23-000033.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1633917","company":"PayPal Holdings, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-10","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1633917\/000163391723000033\/pypl-20221231.htm","filename":"1633917_10K_2022_0001633917-23-000033.htm"},"page_content":"Third parties may allege that we are infringing their patents and other intellectual property rights.\nWe are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.

We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
