We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation, including regulations related to extended producer responsibility (\"EPR\"), could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost, increased energy and freight costs, and new taxes on packaging products or result in reduced demand. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. Government bans of, or restrictions on, certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to Amcor's business.\nIn addition, changes to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials, or applying taxes or fees on some types of our products.","type":"Document"},"23":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1748790","company":"Amcor plc","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-08-17","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"X0","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1748790\/000174879023000030\/amcr-20230630.htm","filename":"1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.htm"},"page_content":"The Company enters into customer-based supply-chain financing programs from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Agreements which result in true sales of the transferred receivables, which occur when receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Agreements that allow the Company to maintain effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale are accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statements of income primarily as a reduction of net sales. The Company did not factor any trade receivables in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 which did not qualify as true sales of the receivables.\nInventories, net: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based upon the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method or average cost method. Costs related to inventories include raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead. Inventory reserves were $130 million and $111 million as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment, Net (\"PP&E\"): PP&E is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and includes expenditures for new facilities and equipment, as well as costs that substantially increase the useful lives or capacity of existing PP&E. Cost of constructed assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period.

We also continue to be impacted by higher inflation in certain areas, such as labor costs. In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which has resulted in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt, particularly on U.S. dollar and Euro denominated debt in the first half of fiscal year 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2023.","type":"Document"},"54":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1748790","company":"Amcor plc","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-08-17","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"X0","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1748790\/000174879023000030\/amcr-20230630.htm","filename":"1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.htm"},"page_content":"Item 1. - Business\nThe Company\nAmcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.

This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business with these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the acquired company. While we have generally been successful in managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition - We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures, and competitive behavior. We regularly bid for new and continuing business in the industries and regions in which we operate, and we continually adapt to changes in consumer demand. While we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may impact our competitiveness, the main methods of competition in the general packaging industry include price, innovation, sustainability, service, and quality.\nThe loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. Additionally, our competitors may develop disruptive technologies or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of established or potential competitors will not materially adversely affect our ability to implement our plans and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.","type":"Document"},"64":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1748790","company":"Amcor plc","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-08-17","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"X0","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1748790\/000174879023000030\/amcr-20230630.htm","filename":"1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.htm"},"page_content":"Item 1. - Business\nThe Company\nAmcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.

The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022.\nRestructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan. The restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics and train new employees on relocated equipment.\n2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan\nOn August 21, 2018, the Company announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging (\"2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan\") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.
