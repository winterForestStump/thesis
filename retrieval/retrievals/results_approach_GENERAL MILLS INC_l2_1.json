We experienced robust growth in organic net sales in North America Retail, aided by our ability to meet the pandemic-related increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter, as well as consistently strong results in U.S. cereal and important improvements in U.S. snack bars and U.S. yogurt throughout the year. We exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our Pet segment, driven by a successful expansion of BLUE into additional customer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand. Organic net sales results in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America segments were below fiscal 2019 levels, due to a slow start to the year in each of those segments, as well as the pandemic-related headwinds impacting Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Asia & Latin America in the second half of the year.\nSecond, we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins. The combination of our continued strong levels of Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, volume growth, and positive net price realization and mix offset input cost inflation and increased investments in brand building and capabilities, resulting in significant growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.\nThird, we reduced our leverage. Our continued cash discipline delivered a significant reduction in core working capital and strong free cash flow conversion, resulting in reduced debt and an important decrease in our leverage ratio.","type":"Document"},"5":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-06-30","period_of_report":"2022-05-29","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0530","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312522185257\/d313744d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.htm"},"page_content":"In Millions\nNet sales:\nCPW\n$\n1,706.5\n$\n1,766.8\n$\n1,654.3\nHDJ\n427.8\n422.4\n391.3\nTotal net sales\n2,134.3\n2,189.2\n2,045.6\nGross margin\n803.1\n882.9\n785.3\nEarnings before income taxes\n249.9\n247.8\n214.0\nEarnings after income taxes\n201.0\n201.7\n176.5\nIn Millions\nMay 29, 2022\nMay 30, 2021\nCurrent assets\n$\n823.9\n$\n877.4\nNoncurrent assets\n839.8\n927.2\nCurrent liabilities\n1,298.8\n1,424.4\nNoncurrent liabilities\n106.5\n142.2\nNOTE 6.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},"9":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm"},"page_content":"We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.","type":"Document"},"62":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm"},"page_content":"We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.\nThe food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth.
