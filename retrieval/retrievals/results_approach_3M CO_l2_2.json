The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price\/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price\/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price\/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units.

In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit\/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes.

The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Companys research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Companys business segments.\nRaw Materials","type":"Document"},"44":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/66740_10K_2022_0000066740-23-000014.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"66740","company":"3M CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-08","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/66740\/000006674023000014\/mmm-20221231.htm","filename":"66740_10K_2022_0000066740-23-000014.htm"},"page_content":"Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year.

The new standard introduces a lessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods presented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the process of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure requirements, and assessed internal controls impacts. Note 16 provides information regarding rent expense for operating leases and minimum lease payments for capital and operating leases under existing lease guidance. While 3M will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2016-02, it does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations.

When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.","type":"Document"},"59":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/66740_10K_2018_0001558370-19-000470.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"66740","company":"3M CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-02-07","period_of_report":"2018-12-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/66740\/000155837019000470\/mmm-20181231x10k.htm","filename":"66740_10K_2018_0001558370-19-000470.htm"},"page_content":"The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement\/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow.
