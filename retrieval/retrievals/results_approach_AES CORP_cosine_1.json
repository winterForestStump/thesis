Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and stock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, where income represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator.\n194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020","type":"Document"},"11":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\n(in millions, except per share data) Loss Shares $ per Share Loss Shares $ per Share Income Shares $ per Share\nBASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (546) 668 $ (0.82) $ (413) 666 $ (0.62) $ 43 665 $ 0.06\nEFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES\nStock options - - - - - - - 1 -\nRestricted stock units - - - - - - - 2 -\nEquity units - - - - - - - - -\nDILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (546) 668 $ (0.82) $ (413) 666 $ (0.62) $ 43 668 $ 0.06\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded 5 million outstanding stock awards and 40 million shares underlying our March 2021 Equity Units because their impact would be anti-dilutive given the loss from continuing operations.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets.

Entities that use supplier finance programs as the buyer party should disclose (1) the key terms of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided and (2) the unpaid amount outstanding, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and a rollforward of those obligations during the annual period. In each interim reporting period, the buyer must disclose the unpaid amount outstanding at the end of the interim period.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Companys useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $661 million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n127 | 2022 Annual Report","type":"Document"},"21":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost.

Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.\nINVENTORY - Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value.

The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions - The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity - The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price.

As part of the transaction, the Company contributed $37 million to Uplight; however, AESs ownership interest in Uplight decreased from 32.3% to 29.6% primarily due to larger contributions from other investors. The transaction was accounted for as a partial disposition in which AES recognized a loss of $25 million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests, mainly as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Uplight as well as the expenses associated with the transaction.\nIn October 2021, the Company contributed an additional $23 million to Uplight.

Also, due to the wide variety of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset group is not recoverable or that may result in a change in useful life, auditing the Companys identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives involved a high degree of subjectivity, particularly given the Companys decarbonization initiatives and shift towards clean energy platforms. In addition, auditing the Companys valuation of long-lived assets used in the Maritza and TEG TEP impairment analyses involved significant judgment due to the significant unobservable inputs used in the estimation of the asset groups fair value. In particular, the significant assumptions for the income approach used to determine the fair value of the asset groups included the Companys projections of revenue growth and discount rates, which are forward-looking assumptions and could be affected by future industry, market, and economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Companys controls over the identification of impairment indicators, re-evaluation of estimated useful lives, and the valuation of the Maritza and TEG TEP long-lived asset impairments. For example, we tested managements monitoring controls over the evaluation of events or changes in circumstances that would require an asset to be tested for recoverability.

Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and\/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity.
