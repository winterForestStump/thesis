This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume was primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively.

The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 3 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives.

The Company's total issuances of debt also included long-term debt issuances of $14,511 million, net of related discounts, premiums and issuance costs.\nDuring 2015, the Company made payments of debt of $37,738 million, which included net payments of $208 million of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, $31,711 million of payments of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and long-term debt payments of $5,819 million. The long-term debt payments included the extinguishment of $2,039 million of long-term debt prior to maturity, which resulted in associated charges of $320 million that were recorded in the line item interest expense in our consolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the debt extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationship.","type":"Document"},"20":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2018-02-23","period_of_report":"2017-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134418000008\/a2017123110-k.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2017_0000021344-18-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations.

On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) issued an opinion (Opinion) predominantly siding with the IRS.

For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a\nvariable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-22","period_of_report":"2021-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134422000009\/ko-20211231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.htm"},"page_content":"Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company.
