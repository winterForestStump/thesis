We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program.

The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note 11.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $906 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $600 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $306 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 915 $ 392 $ 336\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions 9 528 1\n204 2\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions (50) (1) -\nIncrease related to current period tax positions 37 26 29\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities (4) (19) (174) 3\nEffect of foreign currency translation (1) (11) (3)\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 906 $ 915 $ 392\n1 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment on certain tax positions due to the Opinion. Refer to Note 11.\n2 The increase was primarily related to a change in judgment about the Companys tax positions with several foreign jurisdictions.\n3 The decrease was primarily related to a change in judgment about one of the Companys tax positions that became certain as a result of settlement of a matter in the United States.","type":"Document"},"43":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2022_0000021344-23-000011.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-21","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134423000011\/ko-20221231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2022_0000021344-23-000011.htm"},"page_content":"Period Total Number of\nShares Purchased 1\nAverage\nPrice Paid\nPer Share Total Number of\nShares Purchased as Part of the Publicly\nAnnounced Plan 2\nMaximum Number of Shares That May\nYet Be Purchased\nUnder the Publicly\nAnnounced Plan\nOctober 1, 2022 through October 28, 2022 2,142 $ 55.18 - 139,705,526\nOctober 29, 2022 through November 25, 2022 - - - 139,705,526\nNovember 26, 2022 through December 31, 2022 94,298 63.46 - 139,705,526\nTotal 96,440 $ 63.28 -\n1The total number of shares purchased includes: (1) shares purchased, if any, pursuant to the 2019 Plan described in footnote 2 below, and (2) shares surrendered, if any, to the Company to pay the exercise price and\/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and\/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.\n2In February 2019, the Company publicly announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a plan (2019 Plan) for the Company to purchase up to 150 million shares of our common stock.

In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.","type":"Document"},"61":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"21344","company":"COCA COLA CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-22","period_of_report":"2021-12-31","state_location":"GA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/21344\/000002134422000009\/ko-20211231.htm","filename":"21344_10K_2021_0000021344-22-000009.htm"},"page_content":"Audit Committees Responsibility\nThe Audit Committee of our Companys Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance with the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal controls along with auditing and financial reporting matters.
