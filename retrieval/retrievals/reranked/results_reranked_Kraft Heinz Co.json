This increase was primarily driven by a $420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 compared to a $15 million loss on sale of our South Africa subsidiary in 2018, a $162 million non-cash settlement charge in the prior year related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, and a $136 million decrease in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses related to our Venezuelan operations as compared to the prior year period. The $420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 consisted of a $249 million gain on the sale of Heinz India Private Limited (Heinz India) (Heinz India Transaction), a $242 million gain on the sale of certain assets in our natural cheese business in Canada (Canada Natural Cheese Transaction), and a $71 million loss on an anticipated sale of a subsidiary within our Rest of World segment.\nThe effective tax rate was 27.4% in 2019 on pre-tax income compared to 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss. The 2019 effective tax rate was higher primarily driven by lower non-deductible goodwill impairments, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and a decrease in unfavorable rate reconciling items. Current year unfavorable impacts primarily related to non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, the establishment of certain state valuation allowance reserves, and the tax impacts from the Heinz India and Canada Natural Cheese Transactions. These impacts were partially offset by the reversal of certain withholding tax obligations and changes in estimates of certain 2018 U.S. income and deductions."],["What is the total revenue generated by the company and how has the revenue changed over the past few years?","(42.8\n)%\n(a)\nOrganic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Organic Net Sales decreased 0.1% to $2.8 billion in 2019 compared to $2.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (1.2 pp). Unfavorable volume\/mix was due to ongoing weakness in infant nutrition, partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases in Brazil and Mexico.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 42.8% to $363 million in 2019 compared to $635 million in 2018, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (22.6 pp, including 20.8 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and costs not expected to repeat, from a combination of higher labor-related expenses from the impact of the Holidays Act in New Zealand, as well as asset- and inventory-related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Excluding these factors, the decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher supply chain costs and the Heinz India Transaction which closed on January 30, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

This increase was primarily driven by higher collections on trade receivables resulting from the reduction of receivables recorded as a non-cash exchange for sold receivables as we unwound all of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the Programs) in 2018 and as our trade receivables balance was higher at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. This increase was partially offset by a federal tax refund received in the prior year, tax payments associated with the Heinz India Transaction, and increased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2019.

This increase was primarily driven by proceeds from our Canada Natural Cheese Transaction and Heinz India Transaction, proceeds from our net investment hedges, lower capital expenditures, and lower cash payments to acquire businesses year over year. These increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by lower cash collections on previously sold receivables, as we unwound all of our Programs in 2018.

We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous years exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which we calculate the previous years results using the current years exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations."]],"18":[["Are there any ongoing legal proceedings against the company?","On October 8, 2019, the court entered an order consolidating these lawsuits into one proceeding and appointing lead plaintiffs and lead plaintiffs counsel.

We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement.

Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if managements expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of updates to our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. We are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020, which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates.
