We estimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 9% share of the $104 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. In 2022, the salon services industry totaled approximately $68 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry.
