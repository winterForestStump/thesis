However, the growth rate of monthly transacting active Cash App customers has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline in the future. A number of factors have affected and could potentially negatively affect Cash App customer growth and engagement, including our ability to introduce new products and services that are compelling to our customers, the network effects of other customers choosing whether to use Cash App, technical or other problems that affect customer experience, failure to provide sufficient customer support, fraud and scams targeting Cash App customers, and harm to our reputation and brand. Further, certain events or programs, such as government stimulus programs may correlate with periods of significant growth, but such growth may not be sustainable. Additionally, the growth rate of Cash App revenue may be distorted by the prices of bitcoin, as bitcoin revenue may increase or decrease due to the price of bitcoin and may not correlate to customer or engagement growth rates. We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our Square platform in order to offer better or new features, products, and services and to adjust our product offerings to changing economic conditions, but if those features, products, services, and changes fail to be successful, our growth may slow or decline.\nWe have generated significant net losses in the past, and we intend to continue to invest substantially in our business. Thus, we may not be able to maintain profitability.\nWhile we generated net income of $213.1 million and $375.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we generated net losses of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

This share-based compensation expense valuation model requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the variables used in the calculation. These variables include the expected term (weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of the Companys stock, expected risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected term, defined as an average of the vesting term and the contractual term to maturity. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of the Company's common stock along with several entities with characteristics similar to those of the Company. In May 2020, the Company began using its own volatility, as the Company uses its own historical stock price information, such that a peer group is no longer considered necessary. The expected risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process. We are able to approve sellers for these loans while facilitating prudent risk management by using our unique data set of a sellers Square transactions to help facilitate loan underwriting and collections. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loan in less than nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated more than 1.2 million loans and advances, representing more than $8.1 billion. This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts).

Such expansion could also subject our business to substantial risks, including:\ndifficulty in attracting a sufficient number of sellers;\nfailure to anticipate competitive conditions;\nconformity with applicable business customs, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\nincreased costs and difficulty in protecting intellectual property and sensitive data;\nchanges to the way we do business as compared with our current operations or a lack of acceptance of our products and services;\nthe ability to support and integrate with local third-party service providers;\ncompetition with service providers or other entrenched market-players that have greater experience in the local markets than we do;\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations in an environment of diverse culture, laws and customs, challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with global operations;\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining qualified employees;\ndifficulty in gaining acceptance from industry self-regulatory bodies;\ncompliance with multiple, potentially conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy and security;\ncompliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery laws;\npotential tariffs, sanctions, or other trade barriers including fines;\nexchange rate risk;"],["What does the company foresee in terms of future growth and challenges and are there any strategic plans outlined for the upcoming years?","In addition, a number of employees, including many members of management, may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets. As a result, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate these employees, and, if we are unable to do so, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to improve our operational, financial and other internal controls and systems to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur current business and anticipated growth will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must continue to strengthen our existing infrastructure and operational procedures, enhance our internal controls and reporting systems, and ensure we timely and accurately address issues as they arise. In particular, our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in:\nimproving and implementing existing and developing new internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our operational, financial, communications and other internal systems and procedures;\ninstalling enhanced management information and control system; and\npreserving our core values, strategies, and goals and effectively communicating these to our employees worldwide.\nIf we are not successful in developing and implementing the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.\nThese efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of our processes, and other investments and innovations. As we grow, we may not be able to develop and launch new features for our products and services as quickly as a smaller, more efficient organization. If we do not successfully manage our growth, our business will suffer."]]}}
