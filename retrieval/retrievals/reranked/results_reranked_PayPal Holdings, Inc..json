This growth in transaction revenues was partially offset by a decline in TPV and revenue generated from our core PayPal products and services, including foreign currency exchange fees revenue, due primarily to a decrease in revenue earned on eBays marketplace platform. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2022, transaction revenues included $190 million in contractual compensation from sellers that violated our contractual terms, compared to $82 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This contractual compensation and the year-over-year increase are predominantly attributable to activity in international markets.\nThe graphs below present the respective key metrics (in millions) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n*Reflects active accounts at the end of the applicable period.

PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services to help improve the financial health of individuals and to increase economic opportunity for entrepreneurs and businesses of all sizes around the world. Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person payments.\nRegulatory environment\nWe operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened focus by regulators globally on all aspects of the payments industry, including countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. The laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital payments, continue to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including changes to their interpretation and implementation, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customers credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our funding mix. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal or Venmo account balance or our consumer credit products. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs, as we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit or debit cards outside the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions. Macroeconomic environment changes may also result in behavioral shifts in consumer spending patterns affecting the type of funding source they use, which could also impact the funding mix."],["What are the company's major operating expenses and how have these expenses changed over time?","Consumers that have outstanding loans and interest receivable due to the partner institution may experience hardships that result in losses recognized by the partner institution, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned in future periods.

Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by the partner institution does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and in the following quarter, we would be required to make a payment to the partner institution, subject to certain limitations.

We assess whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on our equity method investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and\/or the income approach. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecasted cash flows, and market data of comparable companies, among others.

For the remaining available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, if we identify that the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses, taking into consideration changes to the rating of the security by rating agencies, implied yields versus benchmark yields, and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, among other factors, we estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices.

If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact.

Advertising expense totaled $518 million, $740 million, and $654 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, we consider voluntary termination behavior of our employees as well as trends of actual forfeitures."],["What are the company's pension obligations and contributions and is there a pension fund surplus or deficit?","7,431 4,846\nFunds receivable and customer accounts 36,357 36,141\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,898 1,287\nTotal current assets 57,517 52,574\nLong-term investments 5,018 6,797\nProperty and equipment, net 1,730 1,909\nGoodwill 11,209 11,454\nIntangible assets, net 788 1,332\nOther assets 2,455 1,737\nTotal assets $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 126 $ 197\nFunds payable and amounts due to customers 40,107 38,841\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 4,055 3,755\nIncome taxes payable 813 236\nTotal current liabilities 45,101 43,029\nDeferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities 2,925 2,998\nLong-term debt 10,417 8,049\nTotal liabilities 58,443 54,076\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 13)\nEquity:\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value; 4,000 shares authorized; 1,136 and 1,168 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n- -\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value; 100 shares authorized, unissued\n- -\nTreasury stock at cost, 173 and 132 shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n(16,079) (11,880)\nAdditional paid-in-capital 18,327 17,208\nRetained earnings 18,954 16,535\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (928) (136)\nTotal equity 20,274 21,727\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 78,717 $ 75,803\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\n(In millions, except for per share amounts)\nNet revenues $ 27,518 $ 25,371 $ 21,454\nOperating expenses:\nTransaction expense 12,173 10,315 7,934\nTransaction and credit losses 1,572 1,060 1,741\nCustomer support and operations 2,120 2,075 1,778\nSales and marketing 2,257 2,445 1,861\nTechnology and development 3,253 3,038 2,642\nGeneral and administrative 2,099 2,114 2,070\nRestructuring and other charges 207 62 139\nTotal operating expenses 23,681 21,109 18,165\nOperating income 3,837 4,262 3,289"]],"33":[["How does the company leverage technology for its operations and are there ongoing technological advancements?","If we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative products and services, the use of our products and services and, consequently, our revenues, could decline.\nRapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including payment technologies (including real-time payments, payment card tokenization, virtual currencies, distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, and proximity payment technology such as Near Field Communication and other contactless payments); internet browser technologies, that enable users to easily store their payment card information for use on any retail or e-commerce website; artificial intelligence and machine learning; developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations; and in-store, digital, and social commerce.\nWe expect that new technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services.
