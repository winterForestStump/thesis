The 2018 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic volume growth, return on invested capital, free cash flow conversion, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the\n\t\t\nCompany during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 100% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the three-year performance period and are reflected under Granted in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends, therefore the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted earnings per share.\nThe following table summarizes performance share activity for the years ended December 31:\nWeighted\nWeighted\nWeighted\nAverage\nAverage\nAverage\nNumber of\nGrant Date\nNumber of\nGrant Date\nNumber of\nGrant Date\n(Shares in thousands)\nShares\nFair Value\nShares\nFair Value\nShares\nFair Value\nUndistributed balance -\nAs of January 1\n$\n171.90\n$\n142.98\n$\n120.89\nGranted\n229.13\n191.28\n160.17\nDistributed\n(206)\n159.82\n(314)\n124.88\n(367)\n99.06\nPerformance change\n(56)\n198.39\n173.91\n(38)\n155.98\nForfeited\n(28)\n204.09\n(12)\n171.36\n(29)\n149.08\nAs of December 31\n$\n188.96\n$\n171.90\n$"]],"7":[["What is the company's cash flow generated from operations and are there any notable trends or fluctuations?","Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\nIn 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $1,863 million compared to the same period last year, with this decrease primarily due to lower net income and the cash impact from capitalization of R&D for U.S. tax purposes. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable decreased operating cash flow by $623 million in 2022, compared to an operating cash flow decrease of $507 million in 2021. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section. The 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) largely impacted the 2022 net income component above, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements.

The increase was partially offset primarily due to the Minnesota NRD resolution in the first quarter of 2018 and year-on-year increases in income tax payments. Additional factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in inventory and accounts receivable. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable increased working capital by $406 million in 2018, compared to the working capital increases of $608 million in 2017. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section.\nIn 2017, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $422 million compared to the same period last year. Factors that decreased operating cash flows were increases in pension contributions, plus year-on-year increases in working capital. In December 2017, 3M contributed $600 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, contributing to a year-on-year increase in pension and postretirement contributions of $584 million.

Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above.
