The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.\nINVENTORY - Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets)."],["What is the company's accounts receivable turnover and are there any concerns regarding receivables aging?","Other financial assets - Application of ASC 326 to the Companys $1.5 billion of trade accounts receivable and $326 million of available-for-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of these financial assets.

The majority of our utility contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promises to transfer energy, capacity, and other distribution and\/or transmission services are not distinct. Additionally, as the performance obligation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measure progress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a series. Utility revenue is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (tariffs) that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance completed in each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an output method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the approved tariff.\nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase power to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose to receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and recognize revenue on a net basis."]],"15":[["What are the company's key risks mentioned in the 10-K and how does the company plan to mitigate these risks?","ITEM 1.

This could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOverview Regarding Market Risks\nOur businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related financial instruments."]],"16":[["What are the company's key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section?","In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets."],["What are the company's key insights provided in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section?","Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.\nWe have 28 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and\/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity.

This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations - In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions - The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity - The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction."],["How does the company's management view the company performance?","The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the one-time impact of the 2017 U.S. tax law reform and subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods.

These arrangements allow customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS, representing the transfer of control and constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on the present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of restricted stock units, performance stock units, performance cash units, and stock options. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES - General and administrative expenses include corporate and other expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, which are not directly allocable to our business segments. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and administrative expenses.\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES - Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5-Fair Value and Fair value in this section for additional discussion regarding the determination of fair value."],["How is the company's corporate culture described?","For nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations - In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions - The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity - The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction."]],"28":[["How does the company address Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns and are there any sustainability initiatives in place?","In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions.

See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets."],["How does the company address Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns and are there any sustainability initiatives in place?","We have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations; however, many of our customers do not have or have not maintained, investment-grade credit ratings.

If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AES is unable to use them, there could be a material adverse impact on AES U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lower prices in future PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and\/or difficulty obtaining financing."]],"29":[["What is the company's geographic breakdown of revenue and are there any notable trends or shifts?","(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 5,013 $ 4,335 $ 3,918 16 % 11 %\nSouth America SBU 3,539 3,541 3,159 - % 12 %\nMCAC SBU 2,868 2,157 1,766 33 % 22 %\nEurasia SBU 1,217 1,123 828 8 % 36 %\nCorporate and Other 119 116 231 3 % -50 %\nEliminations (139) (131) (242) 6 % -46 %\nTotal Revenue 12,617 11,141 9,660 13 % 15 %\nOperating Margin:\nUS and Utilities SBU 564 792 638 -29 % 24 %\nSouth America SBU 823 1,069 1,243 -23 % -14 %\nMCAC SBU 820 521 559 57 % -7 %\nEurasia SBU 236 216 186 9 % 16 %\nCorporate and Other 175 158 120 11 % 32 %\nEliminations (70) (45) (53) 56 % -15 %\nTotal Operating Margin 2,548 2,711 2,693 -6 % 1 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses (207) (166) (165) 25 % 1 %\nInterest expense (1,117) (911) (1,038) 23 % -12 %\nInterest income 389 298 268 31 % 11 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (15) (78) (186) -81 % -58 %\nOther expense (68) (60) (53) 13 % 13 %\nOther income 102 410 75 -75 % NM\nLoss on disposal and sale of business interests (9) (1,683) (95) -99 % NM\nGoodwill impairment expense (777) - - NM - %\nAsset impairment expense (763) (1,575) (864) -52 % 82 %\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) (77) (10) 55 NM NM\nOther non-operating expense (175) - (202) NM -100 %\nIncome tax benefit (expense) (265) 133 (216) NM NM\nNet equity in losses of affiliates (71) (24) (123) NM -80 %\nINCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (505) (955) 149 -47 % NM\nGain from disposal of discontinued businesses, net of income tax expense of $0, $1, and $0, respectively - 4 3 -100 % 33 %\nNET INCOME (LOSS) (505) (951) 152 -47 % NM\nLess: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (41) 542 (106) NM NM\nNET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION $ (546) $ (409) $ 46 33 % NM\nAMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS:\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ (546) $ (413) $ 43 32 % NM\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax - 4 3 -100 % 33 %"],["What is the company's geographic breakdown of revenue and are there any notable trends or shifts?","195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDuring 2022, 68% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries.

For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.-Business and Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOperational"],["What does the company foresee in terms of future growth and challenges and are there any strategic plans outlined for the upcoming years?","In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets."]]}}
