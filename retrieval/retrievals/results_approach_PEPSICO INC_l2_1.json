Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our\noperating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.\nSee Return on Invested Capital in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nOur reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years:\nCost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes(a)","type":"Document"},"4":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-09","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747623000007\/pep-20221231.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.htm"},"page_content":"Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit\n2022 2021 Change\nNet revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 9 %\nOperating profit $ 11,512 $ 11,162 3 %\nOperating margin 13.3 % 14.0 % (0.7)\nSee Results of Operations - Division Review for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.\nOperating profit grew 3% while operating margin declined 0.7 percentage points.

We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.\nTax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020.

Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve or properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation.

Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled.\nThese accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.","type":"Document"},"61":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-10","period_of_report":"2021-12-25","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1225","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747622000010\/pep-20211225.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:\n2021 2020\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDebt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578\nProperty, plant and equipment 2,036 1,851\nRecapture of net operating losses 504 504\nPension liabilities 216 -\nRight-of-use assets 450 371\nOther 254 159\nGross deferred tax liabilities 4,038 3,463\nDeferred tax assets\nNet carryforwards 4,974 5,008\nIntangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 1,111 1,146\nShare-based compensation 98 90\nRetiree medical benefits 147 153\nOther employee-related benefits 379 373\nPension benefits - 80\nDeductible state tax and interest benefits 149 150\nLease liabilities 450 371\nOther 842 866\nGross deferred tax assets 8,150 8,237\nValuation allowances (4,628) (4,686)\nDeferred tax assets, net 3,522 3,551\nNet deferred tax liabilities\/(assets) $ 516 $ (88)\nA summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows:\n2021 2020 2019\nBalance, beginning of year $ 4,686 $ 3,599 $ 3,753\nProvision (9) 1,082 (124)\nOther (deductions)\/additions (49) 5 (30)\nBalance, end of year $ 4,628 $ 4,686 $ 3,599\nReserves\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved.
