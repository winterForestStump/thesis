GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","type":"Document"},"29":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Other (6)\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 20\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $10 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC decreased $4 million, mainly driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020\nOperating Margin increased $30 million, or 16%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):\nIncrease at Maritza and St. Nikola primarily driven by higher electricity prices in Bulgaria and higher generation $ 19\nImproved operational performance at Mong Duong 4\nOther 7\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 30\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $20 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC increased $19 million driven by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties\nDuring 2023 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses.

The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court. Preliminary hearings have taken place and are ongoing. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.","type":"Document"},"36":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Additionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","type":"Document"},"52":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES holds a 75% ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","type":"Document"},"58":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"- -
