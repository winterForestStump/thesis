terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.\nFISCAL 2019 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},"1":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-06-28","period_of_report":"2019-05-26","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0529","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312519184675\/d725716d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.htm"},"page_content":"521.8\n373.7\n295.1\nEarnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures\n2,082.0\n2,135.6\n2,271.3\nIncome taxes\n367.8\n57.3\n655.2\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures\n72.0\n84.7\n85.0\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n1,786.2\n2,163.0\n1,701.1\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n33.5\n32.0\n43.6\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$ 1,752.7\n$ 2,131.0\n$ 1,657.5\nEarnings per share - basic\n$ 2.92\n$ 3.69\n$ 2.82\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$ 2.90\n$ 3.64\n$ 2.77\nDividends per share\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.92\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.61 increased 12 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2020 follows:\nFiscal 2020\nIn millions, except per share\nFiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019\nPercent of Net Sales\nConstant-Currency Growth (a)\nNet sales\n$\n17,626.6\n%\nOperating profit\n2,953.9\n%\n16.8\n%\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n2,181.2\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n3.56\n%\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\n%\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n3,058.0\n%\n17.3\n%\n%\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (a)\n$\n3.61\n%\n%\n(a) See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP.\nConsolidated net sales were as follows:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2019\nNet sales (in millions)\n$\n17,626.6\n%\n$\n16,865.2\nContributions from volume growth (a)\npts\nNet price realization and mix\npts","type":"Document"},"11":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm"},"page_content":"Fiscal Year\nNet sales\n$\n17,626.6\n$\n16,865.2\n$\n15,740.4\nCost of sales\n11,496.7\n11,108.4\n10,304.8\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n3,151.6\n2,935.8\n2,850.1\nDivestitures loss\n-\n30.0\n-\nRestructuring, impairment, and other exit costs\n24.4\n275.1\n165.6\nOperating profit\n2,953.9\n2,515.9\n2,419.9\nBenefit plan non-service income\n(112.8)\n(87.9)\n(89.4)\nInterest, net\n466.5\n521.8\n373.7\nEarnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures\n2,600.2\n2,082.0\n2,135.6\nIncome taxes\n480.5\n367.8\n57.3\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures\n91.1\n72.0\n84.7\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n2,210.8\n1,786.2\n2,163.0\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n29.6\n33.5\n32.0\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$\n2,181.2\n$\n1,752.7\n$\n2,131.0\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n3.59\n$\n2.92\n$\n3.69\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$\n3.56\n$\n2.90\n$\n3.64\nDividends per share\n$\n1.96\n$\n1.96\n$\n1.96\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},"21":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-06-28","period_of_report":"2019-05-26","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0529","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312519184675\/d725716d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.htm"},"page_content":"521.8\n373.7\n295.1\nEarnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures\n2,082.0\n2,135.6\n2,271.3\nIncome taxes\n367.8\n57.3\n655.2\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures\n72.0\n84.7\n85.0\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n1,786.2\n2,163.0\n1,701.1\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n33.5\n32.0\n43.6\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$ 1,752.7\n$ 2,131.0\n$ 1,657.5\nEarnings per share - basic\n$ 2.92\n$ 3.69\n$ 2.82\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$ 2.90\n$ 3.64\n$ 2.77\nDividends per share\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.92\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-06-28","period_of_report":"2019-05-26","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0529","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312519184675\/d725716d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2019_0001193125-19-184675.htm"},"page_content":"nationalization of operations;\ncompliance with anti-corruption regulations;\nuncertainty relating to the United Kingdoms planned exit from the European Union;\nforeign tax treaties and policies; and\nrestriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion.","type":"Document"},"69":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-06-30","period_of_report":"2022-05-29","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0530","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312522185257\/d313744d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2022_0001193125-22-185257.htm"},"page_content":"asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based\non relative market valuations.\nContributions and Future Benefit Payments\nWe\ndo\nnot\nexpect\nto\nbe\nrequired\nto\nmake\ncontributions\nto\nour\ndefined\nbenefit\npension,\nother\npostretirement\nbenefit,\nand\npostemployment benefit\nplans in\nfiscal 2023.\nActual fiscal\n2023 contributions\ncould exceed\nour current\nprojections, as\ninfluenced by\nour decision\nto undertake\ndiscretionary funding\nof our benefit\ntrusts and\nfuture changes\nin regulatory\nrequirements.
