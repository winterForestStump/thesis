Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our\noperating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.\nSee Return on Invested Capital in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nOur reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years:\nCost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes(a)","type":"Document"},"3":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-10","period_of_report":"2021-12-25","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1225","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747622000010\/pep-20211225.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.htm"},"page_content":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19 related surge in consumer demand in the prior year.\nPBNA\nNet revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume.

(Celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion.\nIn 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.","type":"Document"},"18":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-10","period_of_report":"2021-12-25","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1225","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747622000010\/pep-20211225.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.htm"},"page_content":"The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020.\nInterest Rates\nOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020.

In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur.\nOur Business Risks","type":"Document"},"31":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2022-02-10","period_of_report":"2021-12-25","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1225","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747622000010\/pep-20211225.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2021_0000077476-22-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $405 million, primarily reflecting lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.\nNet interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our cash tender offers.

Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment.

Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled.\nThese accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.

Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our SodaStream business globally, potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030. In 2022, we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by 2030. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a Time.\nPositive Choices: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food & beverage products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category; accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and offering more products with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 45 countries, and the new SodaStream Professional platform, allowing users to personalize their choices in reusable containers at home or on the go.\nWe believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.\nSee also Item 1A.
