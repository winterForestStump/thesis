There was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward looking assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Companys discount rates and royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\/s\/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJuly 2, 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We experienced robust growth in organic net sales in North America Retail, aided by our ability to meet the pandemic-related increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter, as well as consistently strong results in U.S. cereal and important improvements in U.S. snack bars and U.S. yogurt throughout the year. We exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our Pet segment, driven by a successful expansion of BLUE into additional customer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand. Organic net sales results in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America segments were below fiscal 2019 levels, due to a slow start to the year in each of those segments, as well as the pandemic-related headwinds impacting Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Asia & Latin America in the second half of the year.\nSecond, we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins. The combination of our continued strong levels of Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, volume growth, and positive net price realization and mix offset input cost inflation and increased investments in brand building and capabilities, resulting in significant growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.\nThird, we reduced our leverage.

Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.","type":"Document"},"29":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"40704","company":"GENERAL MILLS INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-07-02","period_of_report":"2020-05-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"0531","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/40704\/000119312520186469\/d89717d10k.htm","filename":"40704_10K_2020_0001193125-20-186469.htm"},"page_content":"Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives.

We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits, which resulted in reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax withholdings, which resulted in reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill.
