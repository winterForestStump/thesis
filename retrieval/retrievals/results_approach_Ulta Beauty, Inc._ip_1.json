Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.\nCurrent Trends\nImpact of COVID-19\nWe closely monitor the continuing impact of COVID-19 on all facets of our business. While operations during fiscal 2022 did not appear to be negatively impacted, the COVID-19 pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic could have negative impacts in the future. The extent of the impact of the pandemic and the conditions and trends that originated during the pandemic on our future business and financial results will depend on, among other things, the potential of temporary restrictions on operating hours, in-store services or reclosing of certain stores or other facilities of ours or our brand partners and other suppliers, supply chain disruptions, increased transportation and shipping costs, higher wholesale costs, increased labor costs, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact of the foregoing on consumer spending.\nIndustry trends","type":"Document"},"44":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1403568_10Q_2023_0001558370-23-019393.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1403568","company":"Ulta Beauty, Inc.","filing_type":"10-Q","filing_date":"2023-11-30","period_of_report":"2023-10-28","state_location":"IL","fiscal_year_end":"0203","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1403568\/000155837023019393\/ulta-20231028x10q.htm","filename":"1403568_10Q_2023_0001558370-23-019393.htm"},"page_content":"(283,512)\n(285,783)\nBalance - April 29, 2023\n50,729\n$\n(797)\n$\n(82,129)\n$\n1,040,378\n$\n1,059,312\n$\n2,018,068\nNet income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n300,102\n300,102\nStock-based compensation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n11,818\n-\n11,818\nStock options exercised and other awards\n-\n-\n-\n-\nPurchase of treasury shares\n-\n-\n(1)\n(100)\n-\n-\n(100)\nRepurchase of common shares, including excise tax\n(594)\n(6)\n-\n-\n(2,737)\n(275,488)\n(278,231)\nBalance - July 29, 2023\n50,139\n$\n(798)\n$\n(82,229)\n$\n1,049,679\n$\n1,083,926\n$\n2,051,877\nNet income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n249,483\n249,483\nStock-based compensation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n11,938\n-\n11,938\nStock options exercised and other awards\n-\n-\n-\nPurchase of treasury shares\n-\n-\n(1)\n(569)\n-\n-\n(569)\nRepurchase of common shares, including excise tax\n(686)\n(7)\n-\n-\n(2,802)\n(281,533)\n(284,342)\nBalance - October 28, 2023\n49,458\n$\n(799)\n$\n(82,798)\n$\n1,058,969\n$\n1,051,876\n$\n2,028,542\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity\n(Unaudited)\nTreasury -\nCommon Stock\nCommon Stock\nAdditional\nTotal\nIssued\nTreasury\nPaid-In\nRetained\nStockholders'\n(In thousands)\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nCapital\nEarnings\nEquity\nBalance - January 29, 2022\n53,049\n$\n(738)\n$\n(53,478)\n$\n934,945\n$\n653,376\n$\n1,535,373\nNet income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n331,395\n331,395\nStock-based compensation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n10,356\n-\n10,356\nStock options exercised and other awards\n-\n-\n6,501\n-\n6,502\nPurchase of treasury shares\n-\n-\n(14)\n(5,172)\n-\n-\n(5,172)\nRepurchase of common shares\n(332)\n(3)\n-\n-\n-\n(132,831)\n(132,834)\nBalance - April 30, 2022\n52,790\n$\n(752)\n$\n(58,650)\n$\n951,802\n$\n851,940\n$\n1,745,620\nNet income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n295,677\n295,677\nStock-based compensation\n-\n-\n-\n-\n12,519\n-\n12,519\nStock options exercised and other awards\n-\n-\n18,018\n-\n18,019\nPurchase of treasury shares\n-\n-\n(3)\n(1,153)\n-\n-\n(1,153)\nRepurchase of common shares\n(798)\n(8)\n-\n-\n-\n(301,606)\n(301,614)\nBalance - July 30, 2022\n52,087\n$\n(755)\n$\n(59,803)\n$\n982,339\n$\n846,011\n$\n1,769,068\nNet income\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n274,585\n274,585\nStock-based compensation\n-\n-\n-\n-","type":"Document"},"45":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1403568_10K_2023_0001558370-23-004581.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1403568","company":"Ulta Beauty, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-24","period_of_report":"2023-01-28","state_location":"IL","fiscal_year_end":"0128","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1403568\/000155837023004581\/ulta-20230128x10k.htm","filename":"1403568_10K_2023_0001558370-23-004581.htm"},"page_content":"Our stock repurchase programs could affect the price of our common stock and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may have in place from time to time, a stock repurchase program.

For instance, we were negatively impacted in fiscal 2022 by persistent cost pressures, including supply chain and labor costs. We expect inflationary cost pressures to continue in 2023 and we continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including customer behavior, and the impact of these factors on customer demand. Continuing or worsening inflation, recessionary concerns and\/or supply chain and labor challenges, as well as the current turmoil in the banking industry, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, profitability, and\/or cash flows.\nAlthough we do not have any operations outside the United States, geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related economic sanctions by Western governments on Russia, has caused greater uncertainty in the global economy and exacerbated the inflation situation.\nThe health of the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items such as beauty products and salon services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, profitability, and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally.
