We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nPART II\nItem 7","type":"Document"},"23":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us.

Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China.

Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (GPUs) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.","type":"Document"},"29":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2016-07-28","period_of_report":"2016-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000119312516662209\/d187868d10k.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.htm"},"page_content":"Industry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models.

Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.","type":"Document"},"40":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"$\n(6,059\n)\n$\n(5,702\n)\n$\n(150\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n16,950\n$\n10,978\n$\n9,831\nPART II\nItem 8\nU.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nU.S.\n$\n52,917\n$\n47,837\n$\n34,972\nForeign\n36,394\n35,879\n36,130\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n89,311\n$\n83,716\n$\n71,102\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\nFederal statutory rate\n21.0%\n21.0%\n21.0%\nEffect of:\nForeign earnings taxed at lower rates\n(1.8)%\n(1.3)%\n(2.7)%\nImpact of intangible property transfers\n0%\n(3.9)%\n0%\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction\n(1.3)%\n(1.1)%\n(1.3)%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.6%\n1.4%\n1.4%\nResearch and development credit\n(1.1)%\n(0.9)%\n(0.9)%\nExcess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation\n(0.7)%\n(1.9)%\n(2.4)%\nInterest, net\n0.8%\n0.5%\n0.5%\nOther reconciling items, net\n0.5%\n(0.7)%\n(1.8)%\nEffective rate\n19.0%\n13.1%\n13.8%\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax.","type":"Document"},"41":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2016-07-28","period_of_report":"2016-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000119312516662209\/d187868d10k.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.htm"},"page_content":"Income Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends.

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.\nPART II\nItem 8\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\nWe read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.","type":"Document"},"43":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies","type":"Document"},"44":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2016-07-28","period_of_report":"2016-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000119312516662209\/d187868d10k.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.htm"},"page_content":"We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam.

These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2016-07-28","period_of_report":"2016-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000119312516662209\/d187868d10k.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2016_0001193125-16-662209.htm"},"page_content":"Liquidity\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions.

We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nSee Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES","type":"Document"},"61":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"789019","company":"MICROSOFT CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-07-27","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/789019\/000095017023035122\/msft-20230630.htm","filename":"789019_10K_2023_0000950170-23-035122.htm"},"page_content":"Weighted average shares outstanding:\nBasic\n7,446\n7,496\n7,547\nDiluted\n7,472\n7,540\n7,608\nRefer to accompanying notes.\nPART II\nItem 8\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nNet income\n$\n72,361\n$\n72,738\n$\n61,271\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax:\nNet change related to derivatives\n(14\n)\nNet change related to investments\n(1,444\n)\n(5,360\n)\n(2,266\n)\nTranslation adjustments and other\n(207\n)\n(1,146\n)\nOther comprehensive loss\n(1,665\n)\n(6,500\n)\n(1,374\n)\nComprehensive income\n$\n70,696\n$\n66,238\n$\n59,897\nRefer to accompanying notes.\nPART II\nItem 8\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\nJune 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n34,704\n$\n13,931\nShort-term investments\n76,558\n90,826\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\n111,262\n104,757\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $650 and $633\n48,688\n44,261\nInventories\n2,500\n3,742\nOther current assets\n21,807\n16,924\nTotal current assets\n184,257\n169,684\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $68,251 and $59,660\n95,641\n74,398\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n14,346\n13,148\nEquity investments\n9,879\n6,891\nGoodwill\n67,886\n67,524\nIntangible assets, net\n9,366\n11,298\nOther long-term assets\n30,601\n21,897\nTotal assets\n$\n411,976\n$\n364,840\nLiabilities and stockholders equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n18,095\n$\n19,000\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n5,247\n2,749\nAccrued compensation\n11,009\n10,661\nShort-term income taxes\n4,152\n4,067\nShort-term unearned revenue\n50,901\n45,538\nOther current liabilities\n14,745\n13,067\nTotal current liabilities\n104,149\n95,082\nLong-term debt\n41,990\n47,032\nLong-term income taxes\n25,560\n26,069\nLong-term unearned revenue\n2,912\n2,870\nDeferred income taxes\nOperating lease liabilities\n12,728\n11,489\nOther long-term liabilities\n17,981\n15,526\nTotal liabilities\n205,753\n198,298\nCommitments and contingencies\nStockholders equity:\nCommon stock and paid-in capital - shares authorized 24,000;
