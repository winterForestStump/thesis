November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. The ASU precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue from contracts with customers if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. Further, the ASU amends ASC 808 to refer to the unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 and requires it to be used only when assessing whether a transaction is in the scope of ASC 606. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M has limited collaborative arrangements. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments, which clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather, should be accounted for in accordance with the lease standard. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-13, which for 3M is January 1, 2020.

Revenue\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related standards (collectively, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily\n\t\t\nrelating to the accelerated recognition for software installation service and training revenue. This cumulative impact reflects retrospective application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Further, the Company applied the practical expedient permitting the effect of all contract modifications that occurred before January 1, 2018 to be aggregated in the transition accounting. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContract Balances:\nDeferred revenue (current portion) as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $617 million and $513 million, respectively, and primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts, the changes in balance of which are related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of these contracts. The balance also contains a deferral for goods that are in-transit at period end for which control transfers to the customer upon delivery. Approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2017 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018.

In Brazil, total sales decreased 11 percent, as organic local-currency sales growth of 5 percent was more than offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\nForeign currency translation decreased year-on-year sales by 2.3 percent, with the translation-related sales decreases in Latin America\/Canada, EMEA and Asia Pacific. Selling prices increased by 1.4 percent year-on-year for the fourth quarter of 2018, with strong price growth in Latin America\/Canada, EMEA and the U.S. In Asia Pacific, price increases were lower compared to other geographic areas, as strong volume growth in electronics had a negative impact on price.\n\t\t\nYear 2018 sales results by geographic area\/business segment:\nPercent change information compares the full year 2018 with the same period last year, unless otherwise indicated.

Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\nRaw materials:","type":"Document"},"57":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/66740_10K_2022_0000066740-23-000014.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"66740","company":"3M CO","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-08","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"MN","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/66740\/000006674023000014\/mmm-20221231.htm","filename":"66740_10K_2022_0000066740-23-000014.htm"},"page_content":"Divestitures (0.6) - (1.1) (0.5)\nTranslation 0.3 2.3 3.8 1.6\nTotal sales change 9.5 % 10.8 % 9.0 % 9.9 %\nAdditional information beyond what is included in the preceding tables is as follows:\nFor the full year 2022, in the Americas geographic area, U.S. total sales were flat which included increased organic sales of 1 percent.

Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.","type":"Document"}}}
