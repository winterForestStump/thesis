The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, respectively.\nWalmart International Segment\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\nNet sales\n$\n118,068\n$\n116,119\n$\n123,408\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.7\n%\n(5.9\n)%\n(9.4\n)%\nOperating income\n$\n5,352\n$\n5,758\n$\n5,346\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales\n4.5\n%\n5.0\n%\n4.3\n%\nUnit counts at period end\n6,360\n6,363\n6,299\nRetail square feet at period end","type":"Document"},"7":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-03-28","period_of_report":"2019-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416919000016\/wmtform10-kx1312019.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.htm"},"page_content":"(8\n)\n(245\n)\n(7,234\n)\n-\n(7,487\n)\n-\n(7,487\n)\nCash dividend declared to noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(488\n)\n(488\n)\nNoncontrolling interest of acquired entity\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,345\n4,345\nOther\n(17\n)\n-\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,878\n$\n$\n2,965\n$\n80,785\n$\n(11,542\n)\n$\n72,496\n$\n7,138\n$\n79,634\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nConsolidated net income\n$\n7,179\n$\n10,523\n$\n14,293\nAdjustments to reconcile consolidated net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n10,678\n10,529\n10,080\nUnrealized (gains) and losses\n3,516\n-\n-\n(Gains) and losses for disposal of business operations\n4,850\n-\n-\nDeferred income taxes\n(499\n)\n(304\n)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n3,136\n-\nOther operating activities\n1,734\n1,210\nChanges in certain assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions:\nReceivables, net\n(368\n)\n(1,074\n)\n(402\n)\nInventories\n(1,311\n)\n(140\n)\n1,021\nAccounts payable\n1,831\n4,086\n3,942\nAccrued liabilities\n1,280\nAccrued income taxes\n(40\n)\n(557\n)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n27,753\n28,337\n31,673\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,344\n)\n(10,051\n)\n(10,619\n)\nProceeds from the disposal of property and equipment\nProceeds from the disposal of certain operations\n1,046\nPurchase of available for sale securities\n-\n-\n(1,901\n)\nPayments for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(14,656\n)\n(375\n)\n(2,463\n)\nOther investing activities\n(431\n)\n(77\n)\n(31\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(24,036\n)\n(9,079\n)\n(13,896\n)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nNet change in short-term borrowings\n(53\n)\n4,148\n(1,673\n)\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n15,872\n7,476\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(3,784\n)\n(13,061\n)\n(2,055\n)\nPremiums paid to extinguish debt\n-\n(3,059\n)\n-\nDividends paid\n(6,102\n)\n(6,124\n)\n(6,216\n)\nPurchase of Company stock\n(7,410\n)\n(8,296\n)\n(8,298\n)","type":"Document"},"8":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2018_0000104169-18-000028.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2018-03-30","period_of_report":"2018-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416918000028\/wmtform10-kx1312018.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2018_0000104169-18-000028.htm"},"page_content":"Fiscal Period\nTotal Number of\nShares Repurchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\n(in dollars)\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nPrograms\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nShares that May Yet Be\nPurchased Under the\nPlans or Programs(1)\n(in billions)\nNovember 1-30, 2017\n6,816,775\n$\n93.00\n6,816,775\n$\n19.8\nDecember 1-31, 2017\n5,594,137\n97.92\n5,594,137\n19.2\nJanuary 1-31, 2018\n4,170,041\n102.37\n4,170,041\n18.8\nTotal\n16,580,953\n16,580,953\n(1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the current plan at the end of the month.

These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.

Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.

Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as eCommerce. Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nThe Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.

Walmart International competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses.

Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.

These equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2018 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018.\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel.
