The cash generated from operating activities was negatively affected by a net outflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $110.8 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth, investments in marketable debt securities, investment in privately held entity, and business acquisitions.","type":"Document"},"8":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Cost of revenue:\nTransaction-based costs 535,283 522,680 388,106 465,779 519,241 519,312 490,349 409,069\nSubscription and services-based costs 65,046 66,786 50,169 40,711 50,276 63,352 60,119 60,523\nHardware costs 35,994 45,220 28,315 34,372 40,504 35,672 33,268 26,941\nBitcoin costs 1,715,452 1,601,615 858,041 299,426 174,438 146,167 122,938 64,696\nAmortization of acquired technology 3,505 3,118 2,231 2,320 1,921 1,934 1,719 1,376\nTotal cost of revenue 2,355,280 2,239,419 1,326,862 842,608 786,380 766,437 708,393 562,605\nGross profit 803,690 794,455 596,763 538,501 527,049 500,037 465,845 396,754\nOperating expenses:\nProduct development 253,448 226,567 206,825 194,986 173,284 168,771 174,201 154,350\nSales and marketing 328,576 348,463 238,096 194,535 185,231 149,467 156,421 133,713\nGeneral and administrative 159,420 153,902 136,386 129,495 118,164 115,980 100,508 101,598\nTransaction and loan losses 15,986 15,198 37,603 108,883 32,132 32,722 34,264 27,841\nAmortization of acquired customer assets 1,077 983 905 890 890 1,003 1,294 1,294\nTotal operating expenses 758,507 745,113 619,815 628,789 509,701 467,943 466,688 418,796\nOperating income (loss) 45,183 49,342 (23,052) (90,288) 17,348 32,094 (843) (22,042)\nGain on sale of asset group - - - - (373,445) - - -\nInterest expense, net 17,988 14,980 14,769 9,206 6,060 5,632 5,143 4,681\nOther expense (income), net (271,212) (784) (25,591) 5,862 (6,715) (5,541) 1,230 11,299\nIncome (loss) before income tax 298,407 35,146 (12,230) (105,356) 391,448 32,003 (7,216) (38,022)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes 4,448 (1,369) (752) 535 508 2,606 (476) 129\nNet income (loss) $ 293,959 $ 36,515 $ (11,478) $ (105,891) $ 390,940 $ 29,397 $ (6,740) $ (38,151)\nNet income (loss) per share:\nBasic $ 0.65 $ 0.08 $ (0.03) $ (0.24) $ 0.91 $ 0.07 $ (0.02) $ (0.09)\nDiluted $ 0.59 $ 0.07 $ (0.03) $ (0.24) $ 0.83 $ 0.06 $ (0.02) $ (0.09)\nWeighted-average shares used to compute net income (loss) per share:","type":"Document"},"9":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Our business has generated net losses, and we intend to continue to invest substantially in our business.

Among other changes, the new guidance removes from GAAP separation models for convertible debt that require the convertible debt to be separated into a debt and equity component, unless the conversion feature is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative or the debt is issued at a substantial premium. As a result, after adopting the guidance, entities will no longer separately present such embedded conversion features in equity, and will instead account for the convertible debt wholly as debt. The new guidance also requires use of the \"if-converted\" method when calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share, which is consistent with the Companys current accounting treatment under the current guidance. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, but only at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company plans to early adopt the new guidance on January 1, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach and expects to record a cumulative effect of adoption of $103.5 million reduction to retained earnings. The Company expects the impact of adoption to result in a reduction to other paid in capital of $502.7 million related to amounts attributable to conversion options that had previously been recorded in equity.

These variables include the expected term (weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of the Companys stock, expected risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected term, defined as an average of the vesting term and the contractual term to maturity. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of the Company's common stock along with several entities with characteristics similar to those of the Company. In May 2020, the Company began using its own volatility, as the Company uses its own historical stock price information, such that a peer group is no longer considered necessary. The expected risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option.

The Company estimates the allowance based on an assessment of various factors, including historical experience, merchants current processing volume, and other factors that may affect the merchants ability to generate future receivables. Additions to the allowance are reflected in current operating results, while charges against the allowance are made when charge-offs are recognized. The additions are classified within transaction and advance losses on the consolidated statements of operations. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company had fully transitioned from offering MCAs to loans. Activity subsequent to this transition relates primarily to updates to the Company's provision estimates for historical balances, write-offs or recoveries. The Company is not exposed to losses for the merchant cash advance receivables that are sold to third-party investors in accordance with the Companys arrangements with them.\nCustomer Funds\nCustomer funds held represent cash stored by customers within the Square Cash App that the customers would later use to send money or make payments, or customer cash in transit.

If we overestimate demand for a particular product, we may experience excess inventory levels for that product and the excess inventory may become obsolete or out-of-date.

Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process. We are able to approve sellers for these loans while facilitating prudent risk management by using our unique data set of a sellers Square transactions to help facilitate loan underwriting and collections. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loan in less than nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated more than 1.2 million loans and advances, representing more than $8.1 billion. This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts).

We offer learning and development programs for all employees, as well as a robust manager training program. Employees are able to actively voice their questions and thoughts through many internal channels, including our company townhall meetings and bi-annual employee engagement surveys. While we have always had distributed teams collaborating around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected experiment in remote work, as the vast majority of our employees pivoted to working from home starting in March 2020. In May 2020, we announced that most employees will continue to have the option to work remotely even after we reopen our offices. This flexible location policy has unlocked opportunities to source, connect, and hire talent in more locations. We believe it will also enable us to retain talent, as employees can continue to work for Square if they need or want to relocate.\nA key focus of our human capital management approach is our commitment to improving inclusion and diversity. In 2020, our focus was on building sustainable systems to champion inclusion and diversity via three critical channels - growing our Communities program (employee resource groups), equipping our managers to build and lead inclusive teams, and making diversity a central component of our recruiting strategy. Each year, we publish our workforce demographics on our inclusion and diversity blog to show how far weve come, where theres room to grow, and how our workforce is evolving from multiple perspectives.

As we grow, we may not be able to develop and launch new features for our products and services as quickly as a smaller, more efficient organization. If we do not successfully manage our growth, our business will suffer.","type":"Document"}}}
