Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change. Recent increases in the percentage of debit, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average transaction size relative to historical periods are in part a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $50.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Seller costs benefited from a higher percentage of debit card transactions and increase in average value per transaction which have lower costs.\nCash App Results\nThe following tables provide a summary of the revenue and gross profit for our Cash App segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):","type":"Document"},"4":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"19,292\n26,776\nLong-term investments\n27,366\n-\nRestricted cash\n14,584\n14,686\nOther assets\n3,194\n3,826\nTotal assets\n$\n1,211,362\n$\n894,772\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n12,602\n$\n18,869\nCustomers payable\n388,058\n215,365\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\n9,446\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\n17,176\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\n44,401\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\n28,945\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n334,202\nDebt (Note 11)\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n57,745\n52,522\nTotal liabilities\n635,209\n386,724\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000001 par value: 100,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Through the Square App Marketplace, sellers can also integrate Square with third-party apps, such as QuickBooks or BigCommerce, that create extensions to our point-of-sale functionality and other back office solutions, and enables sellers to integrate all of their business data.\nSquare Capital\nSquare Capital, through a partnership with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank, facilitates loans to pre-qualified sellers based on real-time payment and point-of-sale data. These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis.

These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.\nSince its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion.\nCaviar","type":"Document"},"17":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Square Point of Sale also includes Square Dashboard, our cloud-based reporting and analytics tool that provides sellers with real-time data and insights about sales, items, customers, and employees. This enables sellers to make informed decisions about their business. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee.\nOur advanced point-of-sale features are ideal for a seller with a more complex business or for a seller who has multiple employees and\/or locations. Location and employee management allows a seller to track sales by location, device, or employee; customize employee permissions; and create employee timecards.

Most of the sellers that use our services are small businesses, many of which are in the early stages of their development, and these businesses are often disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses. In fact, small businesses have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken by governments and private industry to protect the public health such as stay-at-home orders. Many businesses are experiencing reduced sales and are processing fewer payments with us, which has had a negative impact on our results of operations. If they cease to operate, they will likely stop using our products and services altogether. Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services. For example, if sellers processing payments with us receive chargebacks after they cease to operate, we may incur additional losses. Additionally, the growth in the number of sellers qualifying for participation in the Square Capital program may slow, or business loans may be paid more slowly, or not at all. In addition, as we expand our business to offer consumer financing products, those customers may also be disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns.","type":"Document"},"38":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Build with Square also has APIs for sellers to integrate Square with business solutions such as item and inventory management, sales reporting and analytics, and employee management. Through the Square App Marketplace, sellers can also integrate Square with third-party apps, such as QuickBooks or BigCommerce, that create extensions to our point-of-sale functionality and other back office solutions, and enables sellers to integrate all of their business data.\nSquare Capital\nSquare Capital, through a partnership with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank, facilitates loans to pre-qualified sellers based on real-time payment and point-of-sale data. These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.\nSince its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion.\nCaviar","type":"Document"},"39":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"(iv) Includes 4,888 shares that have been withheld by the Company to satisfy its tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards.

Sellers can also send invoices to their customers email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).\nWe recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced client\u00e8ling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers habits.\nDeveloper platform\nWe have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions. Our Point-of-Sale API allows sellers to integrate any iOS or Android point of sale with Square to accept payments and access all other services in the ecosystem. This is particularly useful for sellers with highly-individualized point-of-sale needs. With our e-commerce API, sellers can integrate Square with their e-commerce website, giving them the ability to track, manage, and grow both their online and offline businesses in a single dashboard.","type":"Document"},"45":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Year Ended December 31,\n2015 to 2016\n2014 to 2015\n% Change\n% Change\nDeemed dividend on Series E preferred stock\n$\n-\n$\n(32,200\n)\n$\n-\nNM\nNM\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we issued 10,299,696 shares of our common stock to certain holders of Series E preferred stock, in the form of a deemed stock dividend of $32.2 million.

However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide these businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that combines sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payments and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable.","type":"Document"},"62":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"We have partnered with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank to originate the loans. There has been, and may continue to be, regulatory interest in and\/or litigation challenging partnered lending arrangements where a bank makes loans and then sells and assigns such loans to a non-bank entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of the loan. If our bank partner ceases to partner with us, ceases to abide by the terms of our agreement with them, or cannot partner with us on commercially reasonable terms, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives and\/or obtain licenses to make loans ourselves, Square Capital may need to enter into a new partnership with another qualified financial institution, or revert to the MCA model, both of which may be time-consuming and costly, and as a result Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to explore other models and structures for Square Capital, including other forms of credit. Some of those models or structures may require, or be deemed to require, additional procedures, partnerships, licenses, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed. Should we fail to expand and evolve Square Capital in this manner, or should these new models or structures, or new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, the future growth and success of Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, all of which are subject to change and uncertain interpretation.","type":"Document"}}}
