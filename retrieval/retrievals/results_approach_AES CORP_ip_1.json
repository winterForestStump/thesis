This loss increase reflects the prior year gains on remeasurement of our interest in sPower's development platform and the Fluence capital raise, higher income tax expense, lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, higher interest expense, and lower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile;

This loss increase reflects the prior year gains on remeasurement of our interest in sPower's development platform and the Fluence capital raise, higher income tax expense, lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, higher interest expense, and lower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; partially offset by the prior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, and higher margins from our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.15, from $1.52 to $1.67, mainly driven by higher contributions from our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions and from our South America SBU due to higher margins and increased ownership in AES Andes, partially offset by lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, and higher interest expense.\n84 | 2022 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 % Change 2022 vs. 2021 % Change 2021 vs. 2020\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 5,013 $ 4,335 $ 3,918 16 % 11 %\nSouth America SBU 3,539 3,541 3,159 - % 12 %\nMCAC SBU 2,868 2,157 1,766 33 % 22 %","type":"Document"},"8":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Total pension adjustments, net of income tax - - - - - - - - 10 4\nTotal other comprehensive income - - - - - - - - 662 46\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests - - - - - - - - - (200)\nAcquisitions of noncontrolling interests - - - - - - (78) - (80) (387)\nContributions from noncontrolling interests - - - - - - - - - 178\nSales to noncontrolling interests - - - - - - 78 - (2) 473\nIssuance of preferred shares in subsidiaries - - - - - - - - - 60\nDividends declared on AES common stock ($0.6399\/share)\n- - - - - - (428) - - -\nIssuance and exercise of stock-based compensation benefit plans, net of income tax - - 0.1 - (2.0) 23 10 - - -\nBalance at December 31, 2022 1.0 $ 838 818.8 $ 8 150.0 $ (1,822) $ 6,688 $ (1,635) $ (1,640) $ 2,067\n(1) See Note 1-General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\n(2) Adjustment to record the redeemable stock of Colon at redemption value.\n(3) Includes a $13 million reclass from Additional paid-in capital to Preferred stock to reflect the retrospective adoption of ASU 2020-06.

EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and stock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, where income represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator.\n194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020","type":"Document"},"12":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","type":"Document"},"20":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"874761","company":"AES CORP","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-03-01","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"VA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/874761\/000087476123000010\/aes-20221231.htm","filename":"874761_10K_2022_0000874761-23-000010.htm"},"page_content":"Long-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $23,039 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Companys useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability.

Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and\/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity.
