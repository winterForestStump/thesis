Contingencies and Legal Proceedings\nContingencies - Brazil\nThe Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company will vigorously defend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 million, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases referenced above.\nContingencies - Environmental Matters","type":"Document"},"18":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1748790_10K_2020_0001748790-20-000025.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1748790","company":"Amcor plc","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-08-27","period_of_report":"2020-06-30","state_location":"X0","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1748790\/000174879020000025\/amcr-20200630.htm","filename":"1748790_10K_2020_0001748790-20-000025.htm"},"page_content":"Total current liabilities 3,973.6 4,541.8\nNon-current liabilities:\nLong-term debt, less current portion 6,028.4 5,309.0\nOperating lease liabilities 465.7 -\nDeferred tax liabilities 672.4 1,011.7\nEmployee benefit obligations 391.7 386.8\nOther non-current liabilities 223.2 241.0\nTotal non-current liabilities 7,781.4 6,948.5\nTotal liabilities 11,755.0 11,490.3\nCommitments and contingencies (See Note 19)\nShareholders' Equity\nAmcor plc shareholders equity:\nOrdinary shares ($0.01 par value):\nAuthorized (9,000.0 shares)\nIssued (1,568.5 and 1,625.9 shares, respectively)\n15.7 16.3\nAdditional paid-in capital 5,480.0 6,007.5\nRetained earnings 246.5 323.7\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1,049.3) (722.4)\nTreasury shares (6.7 and 1.4 shares, respectively)\n(67.0) (16.1)\nTotal Amcor plc shareholders' equity 4,625.9 5,609.0\nNon-controlling interest 61.2 65.7\nTotal shareholders' equity 4,687.1 5,674.7\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 16,442.1 $ 17,165.0\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nAmcor plc and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n(in millions)\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income $ 616.6 $ 437.4 $ 586.6\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment 651.6 453.0 357.1\nNet periodic benefit cost 9.1 12.5 7.7\nAmortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs 8.1 5.8 5.1\nAmortization of deferred gain on sale and leasebacks - (7.0) (4.4)\nNet gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment (3.6) (16.0) (18.2)\nGain on disposal of U.S. plants - (159.1) -\nEquity in (income) loss of affiliated companies 14.0 (4.1) 17.5\nNet foreign exchange (gain) loss (16.2) (5.1) 85.9\nShare-based compensation 34.0 18.6 21.0\nOther, net (0.2) (77.9) 0.4\nLoss from hyperinflationary accounting for Argentine subsidiaries 37.9 30.2 -\nDeferred income taxes, net (113.7) 72.8 (73.5)","type":"Document"},"19":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1748790","company":"Amcor plc","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-08-17","period_of_report":"2023-06-30","state_location":"X0","fiscal_year_end":"0630","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1748790\/000174879023000030\/amcr-20230630.htm","filename":"1748790_10K_2023_0001748790-23-000030.htm"},"page_content":"To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares.
