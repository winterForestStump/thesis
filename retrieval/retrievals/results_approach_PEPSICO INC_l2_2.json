We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.\nIn 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), effective January 1, 2022. The benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.\nIn 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share).","type":"Document"},"50":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"77476","company":"PEPSICO INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2023-02-09","period_of_report":"2022-12-31","state_location":"NY","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/77476\/000007747623000007\/pep-20221231.htm","filename":"77476_10K_2022_0000077476-23-000007.htm"},"page_content":"Item 1.
