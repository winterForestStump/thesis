Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change.

However, the growth rate of monthly transacting active Cash App customers has fluctuated over time, and it may slow or decline in the future. A number of factors have affected and could potentially negatively affect Cash App customer growth and engagement, including our ability to introduce new products and services that are compelling to our customers, the network effects of other customers choosing whether to use Cash App, technical or other problems that affect customer experience, failure to provide sufficient customer support, fraud and scams targeting Cash App customers, and harm to our reputation and brand. Further, certain events or programs, such as government stimulus programs may correlate with periods of significant growth, but such growth may not be sustainable. Additionally, the growth rate of Cash App revenue may be distorted by the prices of bitcoin, as bitcoin revenue may increase or decrease due to the price of bitcoin and may not correlate to customer or engagement growth rates. We have invested and will continue to invest in improving our Square platform in order to offer better or new features, products, and services and to adjust our product offerings to changing economic conditions, but if those features, products, services, and changes fail to be successful, our growth may slow or decline.\nWe have generated significant net losses in the past, and we intend to continue to invest substantially in our business.

If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.","type":"Document"},"17":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nShort-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 153,386 $ 782 $ (164) $ 154,004\nCorporate bonds 76,957 256 (14) 77,199\nCommercial paper 4,999 - - 4,999\nMunicipal securities 10,377 57 (3) 10,431\nU.S. government securities 404,194 1,244 (4) 405,434\nForeign government securities 42,988 139 (82) 43,045\nTotal $ 692,901 $ 2,478 $ (267) $ 695,112\nLong-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 168,762 $ 519 $ (3) $ 169,278\nCorporate bonds 174,655 1,401 (42) 176,014\nMunicipal securities 1,045 15 - 1,060\nU.S. government securities 91,642 433 (2) 92,073\nForeign government securities 25,351 184 (10) 25,525\nTotal $ 461,455 $ 2,552 $ (57) $ 463,950\nThe Company's short-term and long-term investments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nShort-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 131,124 $ 409 $ (11) $ 131,522\nCorporate bonds 67,169 580 (28) 67,721\nMunicipal securities 6,667 109 - 6,776\nU.S. government securities 264,069 1,083 (17) 265,135\nForeign government securities 21,270 48 (16) 21,302\nTotal $ 490,299 $ 2,229 $ (72) $ 492,456\nLong-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 63,645 $ 612 $ (189) $ 64,068\nCorporate bonds 141,307 1,832 (61) 143,078\nMunicipal securities 9,594 151 (39) 9,706\nU.S. government securities 294,682 1,287 (190) 295,779\nForeign government securities 24,625 86 (39) 24,672\nTotal $ 533,853 $ 3,968 $ (518) $ 537,303\nThe amortized cost of investments classified as cash equivalents approximated the fair value due to the short-term nature of the investments.\nThe Company's gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020","type":"Document"},"18":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model.

These variables include the expected term (weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of the Companys stock, expected risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected term, defined as an average of the vesting term and the contractual term to maturity. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of the Company's common stock along with several entities with characteristics similar to those of the Company. In May 2020, the Company began using its own volatility, as the Company uses its own historical stock price information, such that a peer group is no longer considered necessary. The expected risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.

Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our extensive commerce ecosystem and our focus on building remarkable products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. In addition, we differentiate ourselves by offering transparent pricing, no long-term contracts, and our ability to innovate and reshape the industries we operate in to expand access to traditionally unserved or underserved sellers. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors. Competitors that overlap with certain functions and features that we provide include:\nPen and paper, manual processes, and paper currency","type":"Document"},"28":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk.

Accordingly, the Company has two operating and reportable segments, which are Seller and Cash App (defined further in Note 19, Segment and Geographical Information). The Company allocated $183.4 million and $112.4 million of the goodwill balance at June 30, 2020 to Seller and Cash App, respectively.

This included the controls over identification and assessment of the qualitative adjustments, the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate the qualitative aspects of the reserve, managements evaluation of new or contradictory information, and managements review and approval of the adjustments.\nTo test the Companys reserve for transaction losses, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Companys methodology and testing the underlying data and assumptions used by management to estimate potential losses. We compared the Companys historical estimated potential losses with actual results to assess the Companys methodology to estimate potential losses. We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the loss rate data used in the calculation of the Companys reserve for transaction losses by agreeing such data to third-party data. In addition, we evaluated adjustments made by management to the Companys methodology to estimate potential losses, to reflect expectations of future chargebacks and uncertainty in the current economic environment, including the basis for concluding whether such adjustments were warranted and whether new or contradictory information existed. We also reviewed subsequent events, which included actual chargebacks, and considered whether they corroborated the Companys conclusion.\nConvertible Senior Notes","type":"Document"},"33":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2021-02-23","period_of_report":"2020-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000151267321000008\/sq-20201231.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2020_0001512673-21-000008.htm"},"page_content":"Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.

We have not historically experienced meaningful seasonality with respect to total net revenue as this effect has been offset by our revenue growth.

Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process. We are able to approve sellers for these loans while facilitating prudent risk management by using our unique data set of a sellers Square transactions to help facilitate loan underwriting and collections. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loan in less than nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated more than 1.2 million loans and advances, representing more than $8.1 billion. This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts).

For example, our Cash App products are intended to make investing in certain assets, such as bitcoin, stocks, and exchange-traded funds, more accessible. However, as a result, our customers who use these products may experience losses or other financial impacts due to, among other things, market fluctuations in the prices of bitcoin and stocks. If our users are adversely affected by such risks, they may cease using the product or Cash App altogether and our business, brand, and reputation may be adversely affected. Further, our newer activities may not lead to growth or recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all and may require significant management time and attention. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and materially and adversely affect our business.","type":"Document"}}}
