To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,\nbased on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Companys ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.\nCarrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired.

PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\nAs of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:\n2021 2020 2019\nShare-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 301 $ 264 $ 237\nShare-based compensation expense - liability awards 20 11 8\nRestructuring charges 1 (1) (2)\nTotal $ 322 $ 274 $ 243\nIncome tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 57 $ 48 $ 39\nExcess tax benefits related to share-based compensation\n$ 38 $ 35 $ 50\nAs of December 25, 2021, there was $372 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants.
