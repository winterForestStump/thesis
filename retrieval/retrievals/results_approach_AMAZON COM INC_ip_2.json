Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, Risk Factors.\nFirst Quarter 2020 Guidance\nNet sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with first quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\nOperating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020.","type":"Document"},"64":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1018724_10K_2019_0001018724-20-000004.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1018724","company":"AMAZON COM INC","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-01-31","period_of_report":"2019-12-31","state_location":"WA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1018724\/000101872420000004\/amzn-20191231x10k.htm","filename":"1018724_10K_2019_0001018724-20-000004.htm"},"page_content":"Finance lease cost\n10,789\nVariable lease cost\nTotal lease cost\n$\n15,424\n__________________\n(1)\nRental expense under operating lease agreements was $2.2 billion and $3.4 billion for 2017 and 2018.\nOther information about lease amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, 2019\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases\n11.5\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases\n5.5\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n3.1\n%\nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases\n2.7\n%\nAs of December 31, 2019, our lease liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nOperating Leases\nFinance Leases\nTotal\nGross lease liabilities\n$\n31,963\n$\n28,875\n$\n60,838\nLess: imputed interest\n(6,128\n)\n(1,896\n)\n(8,024\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n25,835\n26,979\n52,814\nLess: current portion of lease liabilities\n(3,139\n)\n(9,884\n)\n(13,023\n)\nTotal long-term lease liabilities\n$\n22,696\n$\n17,095\n$\n39,791\nNote 5 - ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n2017 Acquisition Activity\nOn May 12, 2017, we acquired Souq Group Ltd., an e-commerce company, for approximately $583 million, net of cash acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion, net of cash acquired.
