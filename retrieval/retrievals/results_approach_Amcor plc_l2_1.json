The Company identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from the supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.\nThe Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume.
