This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts). The Square ecosystem drives competitive differentiation for our Payroll product with the ability to use Payroll in conjunction with our point of sale products, Team Management, and Cash App.","type":"Document"},"19":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Most of the sellers that use our services are small businesses, many of which are in the early stages of their development, and these businesses are often disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses. In fact, small businesses have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken by governments and private industry to protect the public health such as stay-at-home orders. Many businesses are experiencing reduced sales and are processing fewer payments with us, which has had a negative impact on our results of operations. If they cease to operate, they will likely stop using our products and services altogether. Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services. For example, if sellers processing payments with us receive chargebacks after they cease to operate, we may incur additional losses. Additionally, the growth in the number of sellers qualifying for participation in the Square Capital program may slow, or business loans may be paid more slowly, or not at all.

Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","type":"Document"},"43":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"19,292\n26,776\nLong-term investments\n27,366\n-\nRestricted cash\n14,584\n14,686\nOther assets\n3,194\n3,826\nTotal assets\n$\n1,211,362\n$\n894,772\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n12,602\n$\n18,869\nCustomers payable\n388,058\n215,365\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\n9,446\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\n17,176\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\n44,401\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\n28,945\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n334,202\nDebt (Note 11)\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n57,745\n52,522\nTotal liabilities\n635,209\n386,724\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000001 par value: 100,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Sellers can also send invoices to their customers email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).\nWe recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced client\u00e8ling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers habits.\nDeveloper platform\nWe have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions. Our Point-of-Sale API allows sellers to integrate any iOS or Android point of sale with Square to accept payments and access all other services in the ecosystem.

Sellers in the services industry can enable their customers to easily schedule appointments with their preferred time, service, and staff member. Sellers can also send invoices to their customers email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).\nWe recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced client\u00e8ling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers habits.\nDeveloper platform\nWe have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions.

Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Interest Rate Sensitivity\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds.

However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide these businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that combines sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payments and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable.","type":"Document"},"65":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"Additionally, we continue to add features to Square Point of Sale to better meet the needs of specific industries, such as services, retail, and food-related sellers. Sellers in the services industry can enable their customers to easily schedule appointments with their preferred time, service, and staff member. Sellers can also send invoices to their customers email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).\nWe recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced client\u00e8ling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers habits.\nDeveloper platform\nWe have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions. Our Point-of-Sale API allows sellers to integrate any iOS or Android point of sale with Square to accept payments and access all other services in the ecosystem. This is particularly useful for sellers with highly-individualized point-of-sale needs. With our e-commerce API, sellers can integrate Square with their e-commerce website, giving them the ability to track, manage, and grow both their online and offline businesses in a single dashboard.","type":"Document"},"66":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1512673","company":"Square, Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2017-02-27","period_of_report":"2016-12-31","state_location":"CA","fiscal_year_end":"1231","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1512673\/000162828017001754\/a10-kfilingsquareinc2016.htm","filename":"1512673_10K_2016_0001628280-17-001754.htm"},"page_content":"We have partnered with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank to originate the loans.
