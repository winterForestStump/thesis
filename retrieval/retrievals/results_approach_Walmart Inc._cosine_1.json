The FIFO cost-to-retail ratio is generally based on the fiscal year purchase activity. The cost-to-retail ratio for measuring any LIFO provision is based on the initial margin of the fiscal year purchase activity less the impact of any permanent markdowns. The retail method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments and estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the amount of gross profit recognized. Judgments made include recording markdowns used to sell inventory and shrinkage. When management determines the ability to sell inventory has diminished, markdowns for clearance activity and the related cost impact are recorded. Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and age of merchandise, as well as seasonal and fashion trends. Changes in weather and customer preferences could also cause changes in the amount and timing of markdowns from year to year.\nWhen necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. At January 31, 2018 and 2017, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.","type":"Document"},"22":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2018_0000104169-18-000028.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2018-03-30","period_of_report":"2018-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416918000028\/wmtform10-kx1312018.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2018_0000104169-18-000028.htm"},"page_content":"The Company's operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 (\"fiscal 2018\"), January 31, 2017 (\"fiscal 2017\") and January 31, 2016 (\"fiscal 2016\").

Beginning January 2018, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. statutory tax rate and created new taxes focused on foreign-sourced earnings and related-party payments, including the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax and a new tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\"). In addition, the Company was subject to a one-time transition tax in fiscal 2018 on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax.\nThe SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date. Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, the Company made reasonable estimates of the effects and recorded provisional amounts in its financial statements as of January 31, 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. The Company elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the Tax Act when it became effective. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Management completed the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes.","type":"Document"},"41":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2020_0000104169-20-000011.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-03-20","period_of_report":"2020-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416920000011\/wmtform10-kx1312020.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2020_0000104169-20-000011.htm"},"page_content":"-\n13,682\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,552\n28,316\n31,181\nChanges in currency translation and other\n-\n(149\n)\n-\n(149\n)\nAcquisitions\n-\n-\nBalances as of January 31, 2020\n$\n2,593\n$\n28,167\n$\n$\n31,073\n(1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.\nIntangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. (\"JD\") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion, net of tax, in fiscal 2019 based on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.0 billion and $15.6 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.","type":"Document"},"61":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"104169","company":"Walmart Inc.","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2019-03-28","period_of_report":"2019-01-31","state_location":"AR","fiscal_year_end":"0131","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/104169\/000010416919000016\/wmtform10-kx1312019.htm","filename":"104169_10K_2019_0000104169-19-000016.htm"},"page_content":"Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\nWith Fuel\nFuel Impact\nWalmart U.S.\n3.7%\n2.1%\n0.1%\n0.1%\nSam's Club\n5.4%\n2.8%\n1.6%\n1.0%\nTotal U.S.\n4.0%\n2.2%\n0.4%\n0.2%\nWalmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% and 2.1% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth.

At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term.\nComparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.
