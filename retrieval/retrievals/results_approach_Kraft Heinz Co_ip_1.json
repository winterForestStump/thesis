We utilized the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. Through the performance of the 2019 annual impairment test, we identified an impairment related to the U.S. Refrigerated reporting unit. This impairment was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate assumption used for the fair value estimation. The increase in the discount rate was applied to reflect a market participants perceived risk in the valuation implied by the sustained reduction in our stock price and, hence, market capitalization (which decreased approximately 25% from December 29, 2018 to the March 31, 2019 annual impairment test date and sustained this decline through June 29, 2019). Since this valuation assumption change was made in connection with the annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2019 and was not indicative of events or conditions that would have constituted a triggering event during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $118 million in SG&A in the second quarter of 2019 within our United States segment.

We are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020, which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates.

See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our impairment losses.\nNet income\/(loss) attributable to common shareholders increased 119.0% to income of $1.9 billion in 2019 compared to a loss of $10.2 billion in 2018. This change was driven by the operating income\/(loss) factors described above (primarily lower impairment losses in 2019 compared to 2018) and favorable impacts in other expense\/(income), partially offset by a higher effective tax rate and higher interest expense, detailed as follows.","type":"Document"},"9":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"See Note 22, Segment Reporting, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, to the consolidated financial statements for our financial information by segment.\nSee below for discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018.

Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions.

If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if managements expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of updates to our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. We are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020, which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates. Additionally, as a result of this strategic review process, we could decide to divest certain non-strategic assets.

Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives.\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.","type":"Document"},"28":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors.

These increases to net cash used for financing activities were partially offset by decreased cash distributions related to our dividends and lower net repayments of commercial paper.

These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives.\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases.

As a result of these changes, we plan to combine our EMEA, Latin America, and APAC zones to form the International zone. The International zone will be a reportable segment along with the United States and Canada in 2020. We also plan to move our Puerto Rico business from the Latin America zone to the United States zone to consolidate and streamline the management of our product categories and supply chain.

Following this reorganization, we established a new management team in the region at the beginning of 2019 that developed a new five-year operating plan for the region, which established a revised downward outlook for net sales, margin, and cash flows in response to lower expectations for margin and revenue growth opportunities in the region. As a result of this planning process, management revised its expectations downward in relation to the anticipated long-term impact of white space growth opportunities in Middle East and Africa and the impact of discounter store growth in Russia. Additionally, there were declines in forecasted foreign exchange rates in the region. After the impairment, the goodwill carrying amount of the EMEA East reporting unit was approximately $144 million.\nWe recognized a $205 million impairment loss in our Brazil reporting unit within our Rest of World segment.

Additionally, the settlement of these plans impacted the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and service costs associated with our non-U.S. pension plans.\nObligations and Funded Status:\nThe projected benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status of our pension plans were (in millions):\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nDecember 28, 2019\nDecember 29, 2018\nDecember 28, 2019\nDecember 29, 2018\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n4,060\n$\n4,719\n$\n1,930\n$\n3,464\nService cost\nInterest cost\nBenefits paid\n(331\n)\n(191\n)\n(122\n)\n(126\n)\nActuarial losses\/(gains)\n(447\n)\n(118\n)\nPlan amendments\n-\n-\nCurrency\n-\n-\n(175\n)\nSettlements\n-\n(190\n)\n-\n(1,221\n)\nCurtailments\n-\n-\n-\n(1\n)\nSpecial\/contractual termination benefits\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\n(4\n)\n-\nBenefit obligation at end of year\n4,501\n4,060\n2,187\n1,930\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n4,219\n4,785\n2,689\n4,156\nActual return on plan assets\n(185\n)\nEmployer contributions\n-\n-\nBenefits paid\n(331\n)\n(191\n)\n(122\n)\n(126\n)\nCurrency\n-\n-\n(221\n)\nSettlements\n-\n(190\n)\n-\n(1,221\n)\nOther\n-\n-\n-\n(5\n)","type":"Document"},"60":{"lc_attributes":{},"lc_secrets":{},"metadata":{"source":"\/content\/drive\/MyDrive\/Thesis\/FinanceBench\/1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.json","seq_num":1,"cik":"1637459","company":"Kraft Heinz Co","filing_type":"10-K","filing_date":"2020-02-14","period_of_report":"2019-12-28","state_location":"PA","fiscal_year_end":"1228","htm_filing_link":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1637459\/000163745920000027\/form10-k2019.htm","filename":"1637459_10K_2019_0001637459-20-000027.htm"},"page_content":"We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives.\nWe plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. We may also face difficulties divesting business operations with minimal impact to the retained businesses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives, that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations, or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.\nWe are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 29% of our 2019 net sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations.
