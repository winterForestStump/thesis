When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable","23":"Trade Accounts Receivable\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss information, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, and accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from trade accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet.

We own and market four of the world's top five nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries.","54":"Environmental and Social Matters\nAs investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on ESG issues, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among other things, environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights. Where these challenges and risks relate to our business, we acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. We have established specific ESG goals related to water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of added sugar in our beverages; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable agriculture; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals is dependent on many factors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control.\nSee Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\nPension Plan Valuations\nRevenue Recognition\nIncome Taxes","55":"Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including practices and disclosures related to environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our ESG goals and objectives and to accurately and transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and are dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on ESG matters. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.\nAs the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our ESG goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various ESG reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs.","56":"(17\n)%\n%\n(1\n)%\n(15\n)%\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n%\n(2\n)%\n%\n(2\n)%\n%\nLatin America\n(3\n)\n-\n-\nNorth America\n-\n-\nAsia Pacific\n-\n(1\n)\n(4\n)\n(2\n)\nBottling Investments\n(3\n)\n(48\n)\n-\n(47\n)\nCorporate\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.\n* Calculation is not meaningful.\nRepresents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes.

Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events including, but not limited to, the following:\nEurope, Middle East and Africa - favorably impacted as a result of pricing initiatives and product and package mix, partially offset by geographic mix;","57":"Costs incurred 4 97 14 115\nPayments (6) (97) (14) (117)\nNoncash and exchange (1) - 3 2\nAccrued balance at end of year $ 12 $ - $ 5 $ 17\nNOTE 19: OPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives; and (2) a platform services organization supporting operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and capabilities including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social\/digital hubs.\nSegment Products and Services\nThe business of our Company is primarily nonalcoholic beverages. Our geographic operating segments (Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; and Asia Pacific) derive a majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of beverage concentrates and syrups and, in some cases, the sale of finished beverages. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and do\u011fadan businesses as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster. Our Bottling Investments operating segment is composed of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of the geographic location of the bottler. Our Bottling Investments operating segment also includes equity income from the majority of our equity method investees. Our consolidated bottling operations derive the majority of their revenues from the manufacture and sale of finished beverages. Generally, finished product operations produce higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. Refer to Note 3.","58":"North America - favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel and category mix;\nAsia Pacific - unfavorable geographic mix, partially offset by favorable product and package mix;\nGlobal Ventures - favorable channel mix primarily due to the reopening of Costa retail stores, partially offset by unfavorable product mix; and\nBottling Investments - favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.\nThe favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December 31, 2021 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021 and the larger impact of shelter-in-place and social distancing requirements in 2020.\nForeign currency fluctuations increased our consolidated net operating revenues by 1 percent. This favorable impact was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange below.","59":"RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.","60":"- 19 -\nNet income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company 9,542 9,771 7,747\nDividends (per share - $1.76, $1.68 and $1.64 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n(7,617) (7,251) (7,047)\nBalance at end of year 71,019 69,094 66,555\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nBalance at beginning of year (14,330) (14,601) (13,544)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (565) 271 (1,057)\nBalance at end of year (14,895) (14,330) (14,601)\nTreasury Stock\nBalance at beginning of year (51,641) (52,016) (52,244)\nTreasury stock issued to employees related to stock-based compensation plans 376 375 228\nPurchases of stock for treasury (1,336) - -\nBalance at end of year (52,601) (51,641) (52,016)\nTotal Equity Attributable to Shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company $ 24,105 $ 22,999 $ 19,299\nEquity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nBalance at beginning of year $ 1,861 $ 1,985 $ 2,117\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 29 33 21\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments (118) (132) (153)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interests (51) (43) (18)\nContributions by noncontrolling interests - 20 17\nOther activities - (2) 1\nTotal Equity Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests $ 1,721 $ 1,861 $ 1,985\n1 Represents the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, effective January 1, 2021.\nRefer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business","61":"Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company.

As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nIn addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network.\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors.","87":"Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\nThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nWe expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory.","88":"How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe tested controls over the Companys process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, managements process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Companys tax positions.

Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably.

Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\nThe increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2016 and 2017, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to payroll and related expenses, as well as increased spending on online marketing channels.\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\nTechnology and Content\nTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our websites, curation and display of products and services made available on our websites, and infrastructure costs.

Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in peoples lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures.

Accordingly, at December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. The total interest expense and fees we recorded related to the Credit Agreement was approximately $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPaidy credit agreement\nIn February 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Paidy Credit Agreement) with Paidy as co-borrower, which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of \u00a560.0 billion.

Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes. Loans under the Paidy Credit Agreement bear interest at the Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin (based on our public debt rating) ranging from 0.40% to 0.60%. The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier.

The complaint alleges that certain public statements made by the Company during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Companys stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the defendants failure to disclose that, among other things, PayPals business practices with respect to PayPal Credit and regarding interchange rates paid to its bank partner related to its bank-issued co-branded debit cards were non-compliant with applicable laws and\/or regulations.

The terms also allow us to charge the consumer interest and fees in certain circumstances. Due to the relatively small dollar amount of individual loans and interest receivable, we do not require collateral on these balances.\nAnother partner institution is the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. We do not hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program and therefore, do not record these receivables on our consolidated financial statements. PayPal earns a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by the partner institution, which is recorded in revenues from other value added services on our consolidated statements of income (loss).\nAllowance for loans and interest receivable\nThe allowance for loans and interest receivable represents our estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and interest receivables. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as a component of transaction and credit losses on our consolidated statements of income (loss). Increases to the allowance for interest and fees receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues on our consolidated statements of income (loss), or as a reduction of deferred revenue when interest and fees are billed at the inception of a loan or advance.

We have a foreign currency exposure management program in which we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts, generally with maturities of 18 months or less, to reduce the volatility of cash flows primarily related to forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of these foreign currency exchange contracts is to help mitigate the risk that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are adversely affected by changes in the applicable U.S. dollar\/foreign currency exchange rate. These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign currency exchange contracts on a quarterly basis by comparing the critical terms of the derivative instruments with the critical terms of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item; if the critical terms are the same, we conclude the hedge will be perfectly effective. We do not exclude any component of the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We report cash flows arising from derivative instruments consistent with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these derivatives are hedging. Accordingly, the cash flows associated with derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are classified in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.","190":"Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (key metrics) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.","191":"Foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments Other current liabilities 97 103\nTotal derivative liabilities $ 298 $ 130\nMASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS - RIGHTS OF SET-OFF\nUnder master netting agreements with certain counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts, subject to applicable requirements, we are allowed to net settle transactions of the same type with a single net amount payable by one party to the other.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.61 increased 12 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2020 follows:\nFiscal 2020\nIn millions, except per share\nFiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019\nPercent of Net Sales\nConstant-Currency Growth (a)\nNet sales\n$\n17,626.6\n%\nOperating profit\n2,953.9\n%\n16.8\n%\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n2,181.2\n%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n3.56\n%\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\n%\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n3,058.0\n%\n17.3\n%\n%\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (a)\n$\n3.61\n%\n%\n(a) See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP.\nConsolidated net sales were as follows:\nFiscal 2020\nFiscal 2020 vs. Fiscal 2019\nFiscal 2019\nNet sales (in millions)\n$\n17,626.6\n%\n$\n16,865.2\nContributions from volume growth (a)\npts\nNet price realization and mix\npts","209":"27.7\n6.2\n29.6\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$\n2,707.3\n$\n2,339.8\n$\n2,181.2\nEarnings per share - basic\n$\n4.46\n$\n3.81\n$\n3.59\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$\n4.42\n$\n3.78\n$\n3.56\nDividends per share\n$\n2.04\n$\n2.02\n$\n1.96\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","218":"In fiscal 2020, net sales increased 5 percent compared to last year and organic net sales increased 4 percent compared to last year.

Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences.

The terms General Mills, Company, registrant, we, us, and our mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.\nCertain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. We are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.\nThe results of our Pet operating segment include 13 months of results in fiscal 2020 as we changed the Pet operating segments reporting period from an April fiscal year end to a May fiscal year end to match our fiscal calendar. Fiscal 2019 included 12 months of results, and fiscal 2018 did not include results for the Pet operating segment.\nWe manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.\nWe offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories:","227":"We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.\nThere has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019, Walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. PetSmart and Petco accounted for 36 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our Pet segments net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nPrice changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.","228":"The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.","229":"use\nof\nour\nassets\nand\nproper\nfinancial reporting.

Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.","233":"Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nPursuant to Item 601(b)(4)(iii) of Regulation S-K, copies of certain\ninstruments defining the rights of holders of our long-term debt are\nnot filed and, in lieu thereof, we agree to furnish copies to the SEC upon request.\nITEM 16 - Form 10-K Summary\nNot Applicable.\nSignatures\nPursuant to\nthe requirements of\nSection 13 or\n15(d) of the\nSecurities Exchange\nAct of 1934,\nthe registrant has\nduly caused this\nreport\nto be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.\nDate:\nJune 29, 2022\nBy\n\/s\/ Mark A.

There was a significant degree of judgment required in evaluating audit evidence, which consists primarily of forward looking assumptions about future operating results, specifically the revenue growth rates, operating margins, royalty rates and subjective inputs used to estimate the discount rates.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the assumptions about future operating results and the discount and royalty rates used to measure the reporting unit and brand and other intangible fair values. We performed sensitivity analyses over the revenue growth rates, operating margins, brand royalty rates and discount rates to assess the impact of other points within a range of potential assumptions. We evaluated the revenue growth rates and operating margin assumptions by comparing them to recent financial performance and external market and industry data. We evaluated whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Companys discount rates and royalty rates by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\/s\/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJuly 2, 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nWalmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These categories, including eCommerce, consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry.

Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.","271":"Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers. Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments that are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.\nPayments from Suppliers\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures. Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited situations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.\nOperating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as described above. As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses. Because the Company only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in cost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.\nAdvertising Costs","272":"Payments from Suppliers\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances and reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, advertising and supplier-specific fixtures.

For fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.","275":"As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $15.2 billion and $7.2 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, which represents an increase of $8.0 billion and a decrease of $3.3 billion for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 2.9% and 3.7% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, driven by ticket and transaction growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.7% and 1.3% to comparable sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019.\nGross profit rate decreased 14 and 28 basis points for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2020, the decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressure from transportation costs. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.","276":"Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019, 30.4% for fiscal 2018, and 30.3% for fiscal 2017. Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results.

Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.\nEmployees\nAs of the end of fiscal 2019, Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed more than 2.2 million employees (\"associates\") worldwide, with 1.5 million associates in the U.S. and 0.7 million associates internationally.

Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nThe Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $318.5 billion, $307.8 billion and $298.4 billion for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total Company consolidated net sales.\nPhysical. Walmart U.S. operates retail stores in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with supercenters in 49 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, discount stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico and Neighborhood Markets and other small store formats in 36 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico.

The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable store sales of 3.7% and 2.1% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% and 0.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018. Additionally, for fiscal 2018, year-over-year growth in retail square feet further contributed to the year-over-year increase.\nGross profit rate decreased 28 and 24 basis points for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. For fiscal 2018, the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 23 basis points for fiscal 2019 and was relatively flat for fiscal 2018, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to strong sales performance in conjunction with productivity improvements and the prior year comparable period including charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million. These improvements more than offset investments in eCommerce, technology and omni-channel initiatives and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal 2019.","292":"Seasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations.","293":"Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\nSTRATEGIC MERCHANDISE UNITS\nGrocery\n56%\n56%\n56%\nHealth and wellness\n11%\n11%\n11%\nGeneral merchandise\n33%\n33%\n33%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units.

While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.

Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well as incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we created Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives with the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and expanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets including grocery pick up and\/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery locations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers.

While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. ROI was 14.2% and 15.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations.","310":"Return on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the decrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets.","311":"Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n5,492\n15,872\n7,476\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(1,907\n)\n(3,784\n)\n(13,061\n)\nPremiums paid to extinguish debt\n-\n-\n(3,059\n)\nDividends paid\n(6,048\n)\n(6,102\n)\n(6,124\n)\nPurchase of Company stock\n(5,717\n)\n(7,410\n)\n(8,296\n)\nDividends paid to noncontrolling interest\n(555\n)\n(431\n)\n(690\n)\nPurchase of noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n(8\n)\nOther financing activities\n(908\n)\n(629\n)\n(261\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(14,299\n)\n(2,537\n)\n(19,875\n)\nEffect of exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(69\n)\n(438\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n1,759\n(130\n)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year\n7,756\n7,014\n7,144\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of year\n$\n9,515\n$\n7,756\n$\n7,014\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nIncome taxes paid\n$\n3,616\n$\n3,982\n$\n6,179\nInterest paid\n2,464\n2,348\n2,450\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1.

These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 23% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.

Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nThe Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.

The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as eCommerce. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nWalmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce.

Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the transaction.\nDivestiture of banking operations in Walmart Chile and Walmart Canada in December 2018 and April 2019, respectively.","320":"Investment Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in the JD.com (\"JD\") stock price as a result of our equity investment in JD. The change in fair value is recorded within other gains and losses resulted in a gain of $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the stock price of JD. As of January 31, 2020, the fair value of our equity investment in JD was $5.4 billion. As of January 31, 2020, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of JD would have changed our investment in JD by approximately $550 million.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.","321":"Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (\"COSO\") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Management concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2020. The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview","324":"Brand name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S. We also market lines of merchandise under our private-label brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"Bonobos,\" \"Equate,\" \"EV1,\" \"Everstart,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"Onn,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent's Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"SwissTech,\" \"Time and Tru\" and \"Wonder Nation.\" The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, some of which include: \"Better Homes & Gardens,\" \"Farberware\" and \"Russell.\"\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units. When revisions are made, the previous periods' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\nOperations. Many supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets are open 24 hours each day. A variety of payment methods are accepted. Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop technology tools that help better serve customers and be more efficient in stores, such as shelf-scanning robots, autonomous floor scrubbers, and automated unloading conveyor systems.\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations. Walmart U.S.'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.","325":"Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 23% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018.\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like \"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.","326":"Assumption Amount\nDiscount rates used in the calculation of expense\n$ 37\nExpected rate of return $ 49\nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans.

Business.\nGeneral\nFor 150 years, we have produced some of the worlds most beloved products at The Kraft Heinz Company (Nasdaq: KHC).

Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company.\nBefore the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway) and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (3G Capital) (together, the Sponsors), following their acquisition of H. J. Heinz Company on June 7, 2013.\nReportable Segments\nWe manage and report our operating results through four segments. We have three reportable segments defined by geographic region: United States, Canada, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). Our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as Rest of World.

As a result of the 2015 Merger, each outstanding Heinz stock option was converted into 0.443332 of a Kraft Heinz stock option. Following this conversion, the 2013 Omnibus Plan authorized the issuance of up to 17,555,947 shares of our common stock. Non-qualified stock options awarded under the 2013 Omnibus Plan have a five-year cliff vest period and a maximum exercise term of 10 years.

We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices:","441":"Our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations. We hold assets and incur liabilities, earn revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the British pound sterling, euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Brazilian real, Indonesian rupiah, Chinese renminbi, and Indian rupee. Since our consolidated financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results. We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency. As a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommodity, energy, and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating results.","442":"(42.8\n)%\n(a)\nOrganic Net Sales is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.\nFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018:\nNet sales decreased 14.3% to $2.8 billion in 2019 compared to $3.3 billion in 2018 due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (10.3 pp, including 6.9 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and the unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures (3.9 pp). Organic Net Sales decreased 0.1% to $2.8 billion in 2019 compared to $2.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (1.2 pp). Unfavorable volume\/mix was due to ongoing weakness in infant nutrition, partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases in Brazil and Mexico.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 42.8% to $363 million in 2019 compared to $635 million in 2018, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (22.6 pp, including 20.8 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and costs not expected to repeat, from a combination of higher labor-related expenses from the impact of the Holidays Act in New Zealand, as well as asset- and inventory-related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Excluding these factors, the decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher supply chain costs and the Heinz India Transaction which closed on January 30, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax rates, discount rates, growth rates, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if managements expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of updates to our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units might become impaired in the future. We are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020, which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates. Additionally, as a result of this strategic review process, we could decide to divest certain non-strategic assets. As a result, the ongoing development of the enterprise strategy and underlying detailed business plans could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units in the future.","448":"Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors.

These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reform, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, pension settlements and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments.\nThis adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined under U.S. GAAP.

We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation, including regulations related to extended producer responsibility (\"EPR\"), could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost, increased energy and freight costs, and new taxes on packaging products or result in reduced demand. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. Government bans of, or restrictions on, certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to Amcor's business.\nIn addition, changes to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials, or applying taxes or fees on some types of our products.","472":"The Company enters into customer-based supply-chain financing programs from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions.

Agreements that allow the Company to maintain effective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale are accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded on the consolidated balance sheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statements of income primarily as a reduction of net sales. The Company did not factor any trade receivables in fiscal years 2023 and 2022 which did not qualify as true sales of the receivables.\nInventories, net: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is based upon the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method or average cost method. Costs related to inventories include raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nBusiness Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition date fair values.

During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has the ability to record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a discontinued operation in fiscal 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European Commission.

Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the acquired company.

Additionally, our competitors may develop disruptive technologies or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers.

The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2022.\nRestructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs are not linked to restructuring.

Additionally, Square Capital suspended facilitating loans to sellers from mid-March 2020 through the end of July 2020, other than PPP loans, further negatively impacting Seller revenues. Excluding the impact of Square Capital, other Seller subscription and services-based revenue increased due to growth in software subscriptions, Instant Transfers, and Square Card. This was offset by the recovery and improvements in GPV processed from mid-April through the fourth quarter of 2020 as states started relaxing the shelter-in-place orders and businesses started to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we saw a higher percentage of card-not-present transactions from the second quarter through to the fourth quarter of 2020, which have a higher transaction price, as well as the impact of our November 2019 card-present price change. Recent increases in the percentage of debit, proportion of card-not-present volumes, and average transaction size relative to historical periods are in part a result of changes to consumer behaviors related to COVID-19, which may not continue in future quarters.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue for the Seller segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $50.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months.

These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.\nSince its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion.\nCaviar","532":"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The maturity date of any PPPLF loan will be accelerated on and to the extent of (i) the date of any loan forgiveness reimbursement by the SBA for any PPP loan securing such PPPLF loan; or (ii) the date of purchase by the SBA from Square Capital of any PPP loan securing such PPPLF loan to realize on the SBAs guarantee of such PPP loan. The maturity date of all PPPLF Loans shall be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default by Square Capital, including but not limited to the failure to comply with a requirement of the PPPLF agreement or any representation, warranty, or covenant of Square Capital under the PPPLF agreement being inaccurate on or as of the date it is deemed to be made or on any date on which an PPPLF loan remains outstanding. The Company can also at its option prepay the advances in full or in part without penalty. Square Capital also shall prepay PPPLF loans so that the amount of any PPPLF loans outstanding does not exceed the outstanding amount of PPP loans pledged to secure such PPPLF loans. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans as of February 23, 2021.\nConvertible Senior Notes due in 2026 and 2027","534":"Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Most of the sellers that use our services are small businesses, many of which are in the early stages of their development, and these businesses are often disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses. In fact, small businesses have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken by governments and private industry to protect the public health such as stay-at-home orders. Many businesses are experiencing reduced sales and are processing fewer payments with us, which has had a negative impact on our results of operations. If they cease to operate, they will likely stop using our products and services altogether. Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services. For example, if sellers processing payments with us receive chargebacks after they cease to operate, we may incur additional losses. Additionally, the growth in the number of sellers qualifying for participation in the Square Capital program may slow, or business loans may be paid more slowly, or not at all. In addition, as we expand our business to offer consumer financing products, those customers may also be disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns.","553":"Build with Square also has APIs for sellers to integrate Square with business solutions such as item and inventory management, sales reporting and analytics, and employee management.

These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.\nSince its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion.\nCaviar","554":"(iv) Includes 4,888 shares that have been withheld by the Company to satisfy its tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA","555":"As a participant in the PPP, Square Capital is exposed to new risks and uncertainties since certain processes and program requirements are still being developed, iterated upon, and have not yet been tested, which exposes us to risks related to documentation, verification, forgiveness, and servicing of such loans. In the event that it is determined that a borrower does not qualify for loan forgiveness or if a borrower defaults on its PPP loan, Square Capital is at risk to the extent the SBA may decline to honor its guarantee or to forgive the loan due to documentation or verification errors, failure to follow regulatory requirements, or lack of adherence to underwriting standards. As a result, Square Capitals documentation and review and underwriting processes will be subject to scrutiny, and we could incur losses if we fail to comply with the SBA documentation and other requirements. We also may become subject to litigation arising as a result of our participation in this program, which could result in significant financial liability or could adversely affect our reputation. There can be no assurance that Square Capital will be successful in mitigating all of the risks associated with the PPP or that this lending will not have a negative impact on Square Capitals business and results of operations.","556":"The business loans are generally unsecured obligations of our Square sellers who utilize Square Capital, and they are not guaranteed or insured in any way. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","557":"19,292\n26,776\nLong-term investments\n27,366\n-\nRestricted cash\n14,584\n14,686\nOther assets\n3,194\n3,826\nTotal assets\n$\n1,211,362\n$\n894,772\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n12,602\n$\n18,869\nCustomers payable\n388,058\n215,365\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\n9,446\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\n17,176\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\n44,401\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\n28,945\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n334,202\nDebt (Note 11)\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n57,745\n52,522\nTotal liabilities\n635,209\n386,724\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000001 par value: 100,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide these businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that combines sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payments and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable.","577":"We have partnered with a Utah-chartered, member FDIC industrial bank to originate the loans. There has been, and may continue to be, regulatory interest in and\/or litigation challenging partnered lending arrangements where a bank makes loans and then sells and assigns such loans to a non-bank entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of the loan. If our bank partner ceases to partner with us, ceases to abide by the terms of our agreement with them, or cannot partner with us on commercially reasonable terms, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives and\/or obtain licenses to make loans ourselves, Square Capital may need to enter into a new partnership with another qualified financial institution, or revert to the MCA model, both of which may be time-consuming and costly, and as a result Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe intend to continue to explore other models and structures for Square Capital, including other forms of credit. Some of those models or structures may require, or be deemed to require, additional procedures, partnerships, licenses, or capabilities that we have not yet obtained or developed. Should we fail to expand and evolve Square Capital in this manner, or should these new models or structures, or new regulations or interpretations of existing regulations, impose requirements on us that are impractical or that we cannot satisfy, the future growth and success of Square Capital may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation and oversight in a variety of areas, all of which are subject to change and uncertain interpretation.","578":"2017 divestitures:\nIn January 2017, 3M sold the assets of its safety prescription eyewear business, with annual sales of approximately $45 million, to HOYA Vision Care.

When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations.

In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022 was $800 million.

The termination resulted in an immaterial loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\nDuring 2018, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $1.2 billion as hedges\nagainst interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt.

In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit\/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes.

Further information on product warranties are not disclosed, as the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The fair value of 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\nRelated Party Activity:\n3M does not have any material related party activity.\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These include various products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities and Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings","612":"In New Jersey, 3M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, a publicly traded water utility serving customers in and around certain portions of Middlesex County, New Jersey, which alleges PFAS contamination of its water system. The Court denied 3Ms motion for summary judgment in October 2022 and a trial date has been set for October 2, 2023. The parties are exploring potential resolution in advance of trial. In September 2020, 3M was named a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the Pequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is scheduled to commence in June 2023 (Hopatcong) and July 2023 (Pequannock).\n3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 27 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. 3M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in ten cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3Ms share is not considered material. Plaintiffs in the 17 remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their disabled adult children. In July 2022, plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against defendants other than 3M, which motion was denied by the court. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of these cases. In December 2022, an additional personal injury case was filed in New Jersey State court.","613":"PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues and regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3Ms reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\nEurope","614":"PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies.

Under the terms of the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an $850 million grant to the State for a special 3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund. This Fund will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation. 3M recorded a charge of $897 million ($710 million after-tax), inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a related $60 million tax expense resulting from the Companys ongoing IRS examination under the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) and new guidance released under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Also during the first quarter of 2018, 3M recorded a tax expense of $217 million related to a measurement period adjustment to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the fourth quarter 2018, 3M finalized the tax impact related to TCJA with a reversal of previously recorded tax expense in the amount of $41 million.","616":"The TCJA was enacted in December 2017. Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of up to one year from the TCJAs enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as follows:\nTransition tax: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company recorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA. The TCJAs transition\n\t\t\ntax is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with the transition tax.\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax expense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts. During 2018, 3M recorded an additional net tax expense of $79 million as an associated measurement period adjustment.","617":"Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.","618":"Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled.

Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.821 billion in 2018, $1.870 billion in 2017 and $1.764 billion in 2016. Research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains\/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\nThe Companys products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Companys research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.

The new standard introduces a lessee model that would require entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current accounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct financing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as evaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific provisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides for retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods presented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the process of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure requirements, and assessed internal controls impacts.

When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.","636":"The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement\/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow.

We also expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather than over the subscription period from certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both software licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some instances from recognition at the time of billing.\nWe currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we expect from the adoption of the new standard.\nNOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.

Individual and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software to attack our products and services and gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our network or data security could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.","668":"PART I\nItem 1A\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code.

We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.","672":"ITEM 1.

The litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be served.\nOther\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and managements view of these matters may change in the future.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521 million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.\nPART II\nItem 8\nIndemnifications","674":"European copyright levies\nWe assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokias alleged failure to pay private copying levies in various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (EU) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007 pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France.\nOther patent and intellectual property claims\nIn addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2016.\nAntitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions\nAntitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and\/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.\nPART II\nItem 8","675":"The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.\nDeveloping new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.","676":"Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.","677":"Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.","678":"$ 52,540\n$ 60,542\n$ 59,755\n(13)%\n1%\nOperating income\n$ 20,182\n$ 18,161\n$ 27,759\n11%\n(35)%\nDiluted earnings per share\n$ 2.10\n$ 1.48\n$ 2.63\n42%\n(44)%\nFiscal year 2016 compared with fiscal year 2015\nRevenue decreased $8.3 billion or 9%, primarily due to the impact of the net revenue deferral from Windows 10 of $6.6 billion and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.8 billion or 4%. Windows 10 revenue is primarily recognized at the time of billing in the More Personal Computing segment, and the deferral and subsequent recognition of revenue is reflected in Corporate and Other. More Personal Computing revenue decreased, mainly due to lower revenue from Devices and Windows, offset in part by higher revenue from search advertising and Gaming. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, primarily due to higher revenue from server products and cloud services and Enterprise Services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased slightly, driven by an increase in Office and Dynamics revenue.\nOperating income increased $2.0 billion or 11%, primarily due to a decrease in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses and sales and marketing expenses, offset in part by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased $8.0 billion or 13%, driven by the decline in revenue as discussed above, and included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $3.3 billion or 5%. Productivity and Business Processes and More Personal Computing gross margin decreased, offset in part by higher gross margin from Intelligent Cloud.\nKey changes in expenses were:\nCost of revenue decreased $258 million or 1%, mainly due to a reduction in phone sales, driven by the change in strategy for the phone business, offset in part by growth in commercial cloud and search advertising.","679":"The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken.

Our foreign regional operating centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and 81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest, U.S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.\nThe decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of impairment and restructuring charges.\nThe components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n(In millions)\nJune 30,","681":"Server products and cloud services revenue grew $1.6 billion or 9%, primarily driven by higher premium mix of Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, and System Center, as well as continued revenue growth from Azure.\nEnterprise Services revenue grew $325 million or 7%, mainly due to growth in Premier Support Services.\nIntelligent Cloud operating income increased $1.4 billion or 17%, primarily due to higher gross margin, offset in part by higher operating expenses. Gross margin increased $1.6 billion or 10%, driven by revenue growth from our server products and services. Gross margin included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. Cost of revenue increased $404 million or 7%, mainly due to higher cloud infrastructure expenses, reflecting increased datacenter capacity for our Azure services. Operating expenses increased $151 million or 2%, driven by higher research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased $160 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services.\nMore Personal Computing\nMore Personal Computing revenue increased $4.7 billion or 12%, mainly due to growth in Devices, search advertising, and Gaming revenue, offset in part by a decline in revenue from Windows.\nDevices revenue increased $7.0 billion or 152%, mainly due to a full year of phone sales and higher Surface revenue. Devices revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 5%. Phones revenue increased $5.5 billion, as we sold 36.8 million Lumia phones and 126.8 million other phones in fiscal year 2015, compared with 5.8 million and 30.3 million sold, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 following the acquisition of Nokia Corporations (Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS). We acquired NDS in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Surface revenue increased 65% to $3.6 billion, primarily due to Surface Pro 3 units sold.

In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.","684":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/12\/15\n4.13\nTenth Supplemental Indenture for 1.300% Notes due 2018, 2.000% Notes due 2020, 2.650% Notes due 2022, 3.125% Notes due 2025, 4.200% Notes due 2035, 4.450% Notes due 2045, and 4.750% Notes due 2055, dated as of November 3, 2015, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n11\/3\/15\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\nX\n10.3*\nMicrosoft Corporation 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n8-K\n10.3\n11\/15\/04\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/12\n10.4\n7\/26\/12\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/12\n10.5\n4\/19\/12\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement for Non-Employee Directors under the Microsoft Corporation 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.9\n9\/1\/04\n10.10*\nForm of Stock Option Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.12\n9\/1\/04\n10.11*\nForm of Stock Option Agreement for Non-Employee Directors under the 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.13\n9\/1\/04\n10.12\n2009 Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee\n10-K\n6\/30\/10\n10.12\n7\/30\/10\n10.13\nAmended and Restated 2003 Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee\n10-K\n6\/30\/10\n10.13\n7\/30\/10\n10.14*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/15\n10.14\n7\/31\/15\n10.17*\nExecutive Officer Incentive Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.17\n10\/22\/15\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.18*\nForm of Executive Officer Incentive Plan Stock Award Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.18\n10\/22\/15","685":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/3\/2017\n4.16\nThirteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.525% Notes due 2050 and 2.675% Notes due 2060, dated as of June 1, 2020, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n6\/1\/2020\n4.17\nFourteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.921% Notes due 2052 and 3.041% Notes due 2062, dated as of March 17, 2021, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n3\/17\/2021\n4.18\nDescription of Securities\n10-K\n6\/30\/2019\n4.16\n8\/1\/2019\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.1\n10\/20\/2016\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2012\n10.4\n7\/26\/2012\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2018\n10.5\n8\/3\/2018\n10.6*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\nDEF14A\nAnnex C\n10\/16\/2017\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.26\n4\/26\/2018\n10.8*\nForm of Performance Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.27\n4\/26\/2018\n10.9\nAmended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.12\n10\/20\/2016\n10.10\nAssumption of Beneficiaries Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement\n10-K\n6\/30\/2020\n10.25\n7\/30\/2020\n10.11","686":"(In millions)\nThree Months Ending,\nSeptember 30, 2016\n$ 10,194\nDecember 31, 2016\n8,348\nMarch 31, 2017\n5,868\nJune 30, 2017\n3,058\nThereafter\n6,441\nTotal\n$ 33,909\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

See Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.\nOVERVIEW\nMicrosoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. Our strategy is to build best-in-class platforms and productivity services for a mobile-first, cloud-first world. We develop, license, and support a wide range of software products, services, and devices that deliver new opportunities, greater convenience, and enhanced value to peoples lives.","691":"A few examples of our continued progress include:\nSigned new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts.\nContracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.\nDiverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint.\nProtected 12,270 acres of land in Belize - more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world.\nMicrosoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data intelligence for organizations.\nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025.\nStrengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.\nEngaging our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new opportunities.","692":"We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (Windows OEM) revenue decreased 25%.\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.","693":"Current year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of $152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively. Prior year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $3.3 billion and $0.44, respectively.\nPART II\nItem 7\nSEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except percentages)\nPercentage\nChange\nRevenue\nProductivity and Business Processes\n$\n69,274\n$\n63,364\n9%\nIntelligent Cloud\n87,907\n74,965\n17%\nMore Personal Computing\n54,734\n59,941\n(9)%\nTotal\n$\n211,915\n$\n198,270\n7%\nOperating Income\nProductivity and Business Processes\n$\n34,189\n$\n29,690\n15%\nIntelligent Cloud\n37,884\n33,203\n14%\nMore Personal Computing\n16,450\n20,490\n(20)%\nTotal\n$\n88,523\n$\n83,383\n6%\nReportable Segments\nFiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022\nProductivity and Business Processes\nRevenue increased $5.9 billion or 9%.\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased $3.7 billion or 10%. Office 365 Commercial revenue grew 13% with seat growth of 11%, driven by small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, as well as growth in revenue per user. Office Commercial products revenue declined 21% driven by continued customer shift to cloud offerings.\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased $140 million or 2%. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew 12% to 67.0 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased $1.3 billion or 10% driven by Talent Solutions.\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased $750 million or 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\nOperating income increased $4.5 billion or 15%.","694":"We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.","695":"We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method.\nSegment Information\nIn June 2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance based on our new segments described in Note 21 - Segment Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change primarily impacted Note 10 - Goodwill, Note 15 - Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 - Segment Information and Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.\nEstimates and Assumptions","696":"See Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.","697":"Liquidity\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, as discussed above under Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments, the majority of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. We expect existing domestic cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, debt maturities, and material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing foreign cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\nPART II\nItem 7\nShould we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, such as business acquisitions and share repurchases, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates, increased interest expense, or dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nSee Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES","698":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/12\/15\n4.13\nTenth Supplemental Indenture for 1.300% Notes due 2018, 2.000% Notes due 2020, 2.650% Notes due 2022, 3.125% Notes due 2025, 4.200% Notes due 2035, 4.450% Notes due 2045, and 4.750% Notes due 2055, dated as of November 3, 2015, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n11\/3\/15\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\nX\n10.3*\nMicrosoft Corporation 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n8-K\n10.3\n11\/15\/04\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/12\n10.4\n7\/26\/12\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/12\n10.5\n4\/19\/12\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement for Non-Employee Directors under the Microsoft Corporation 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.9\n9\/1\/04\n10.10*\nForm of Stock Option Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.12\n9\/1\/04\n10.11*\nForm of Stock Option Agreement for Non-Employee Directors under the 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/04\n10.13\n9\/1\/04\n10.12\n2009 Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee\n10-K\n6\/30\/10\n10.12\n7\/30\/10\n10.13\nAmended and Restated 2003 Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, as trustee\n10-K\n6\/30\/10\n10.13\n7\/30\/10\n10.14*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors\n10-K\n6\/30\/15\n10.14\n7\/31\/15\n10.17*\nExecutive Officer Incentive Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.17\n10\/22\/15\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.18*\nForm of Executive Officer Incentive Plan Stock Award Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.18\n10\/22\/15","699":"Item 1\nPART I\nITEM 1.

This insight-led, analytical approach to site selection has resulted in a high performing real estate portfolio. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $1.7 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables.

A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\/s\/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 24, 2023\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 29,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n737,877\n$\n431,560\nReceivables, net\n199,422\n233,682\nMerchandise inventories, net\n1,603,451\n1,499,218\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n130,246\n110,814\nPrepaid income taxes\n38,308\n5,909\nTotal current assets\n2,709,304\n2,281,183","724":"1,023,997\n998,816\nRetained earnings\n1,051,876\n995,773\n983,140\nTotal stockholders equity\n2,028,542\n1,959,811\n1,922,255\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity\n$\n5,595,008\n$\n5,370,411\n$\n5,331,549\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(Unaudited)\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet sales\n$\n2,488,933\n$\n2,338,793\n$\n7,653,005\n$\n6,981,807\nCost of sales\n1,496,866\n1,375,976\n4,612,469\n4,149,800\nGross profit\n992,067\n962,817\n3,040,536\n2,832,007\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n661,380\n597,164\n1,874,201\n1,632,593\nPre-opening expenses\n3,460\n3,797\n5,396\n8,422\nOperating income\n327,227\n361,856\n1,160,939\n1,190,992\nInterest income, net\n(2,497)\n(849)\n(14,294)\n(556)\nIncome before income taxes\n329,724\n362,705\n1,175,233\n1,191,548\nIncome tax expense\n80,241\n88,120\n278,597\n289,891\nNet income\n$\n249,483\n$\n274,585\n$\n896,636\n$\n901,657\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n5.09\n$\n5.37\n$\n18.08\n$\n17.45\nDiluted\n$\n5.07\n$\n5.34\n$\n17.99\n$\n17.35\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n49,007\n51,131\n49,592\n51,663\nDiluted\n49,226\n51,418\n49,846\n51,962\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(Unaudited)\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nOperating activities\nNet income\n$\n896,636\n$\n901,657\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n181,273\n182,182\nNon-cash lease expense\n232,772\n222,548\nDeferred income taxes\n1,528\n(1,066)\nStock-based compensation expense\n33,477\n32,554\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment\n6,310\n3,892\nChange in operating assets and liabilities:\nReceivables\n(3,446)\n33,378\nMerchandise inventories\n(717,855)\n(615,451)\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n12,964\n(26,828)\nIncome taxes\n9,535\n(49,446)\nAccounts payable\n41,817\n94,214\nAccrued liabilities","725":"efforts to optimize our real estate portfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.\nCurrent Trends\nIndustry trends\nOur research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years.

Furthermore, inflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with higher costs.

As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors.

Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors. Additionally, omnichannel retailing continues to rapidly evolve, and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors.

A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\/s\/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nMarch 24, 2023\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 29,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n737,877\n$\n431,560\nReceivables, net\n199,422\n233,682\nMerchandise inventories, net\n1,603,451\n1,499,218\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n130,246\n110,814\nPrepaid income taxes\n38,308\n5,909\nTotal current assets\n2,709,304\n2,281,183","758":"2,395,299\n2,061,545\n1,583,017\nImpairment, restructuring and other costs\n-\n-\n114,322\nPre-opening expenses\n10,601\n9,517\n15,000\nOperating income\n1,638,610\n1,297,492\n236,820\nInterest (income) expense, net\n(4,934)\n1,663\n5,735\nIncome before income taxes\n1,643,544\n1,295,829\n231,085\nIncome tax expense\n401,136\n309,992\n55,250\nNet income\n$\n1,242,408\n$\n985,837\n$\n175,835\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n24.17\n$\n18.09\n$\n3.12\nDiluted\n$\n24.01\n$\n17.98\n$\n3.11\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic\n51,403\n54,482\n56,351\nDiluted\n51,738\n54,841\n56,558\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFiscal year ended\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\n(In thousands)\nNet income\n$\n1,242,408\n$\n985,837\n$\n175,835\nOther comprehensive income:\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n-\n(56)\nComprehensive income\n$\n1,242,408\n$\n985,781\n$\n175,891\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nUlta Beauty, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal year ended\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 29,\nJanuary 30,\n(In thousands)\nOperating activities\nNet income\n$\n1,242,408\n$\n985,837\n$\n175,835\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n241,372\n268,460\n297,772\nNon-cash lease expense\n301,912\n276,229\n268,071\nLong-lived asset impairment charge\n-\n-\n72,533\nDeferred income taxes\n15,653\n(25,666)\n(24,008)\nStock-based compensation expense\n43,044\n47,259\n27,583\nLoss on disposal of property and equipment\n6,688\n5,358\n6,827\nChange in operating assets and liabilities:\nReceivables\n34,260\n(40,573)\n(53,772)\nMerchandise inventories\n(104,233)\n(331,003)\n125,486\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n(19,432)\n(3,412)\n(4,363)\nIncome taxes\n(45,182)\n(35,652)\n58,916\nAccounts payable\n8,309\n66,156\n62,324\nAccrued liabilities\n48,249\n58,598\n58,599\nDeferred revenue\n41,098\n79,196\n36,848\nOperating lease liabilities\n(324,500)\n(303,914)\n(297,513)\nOther assets and liabilities","759":"We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any failure to adequately protect our critical information technology systems, successfully upgrade our information technology systems or any material disruption of our information systems could negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations, particularly during the holiday season.\nWe are dependent on a variety of information systems, including management, supply chain and financial information, and various other processes and transactions, to effectively manage our business.

If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various\n74 | 2022 Annual Report","776":"December 31, Annual Maturities\n2023 $ 1,761\n2024 2,687\n2025 2,237\n2026 1,040\n2027 2,720\nThereafter 9,293\nUnamortized (discount) premium & debt issuance (costs), net (309)\nTotal $ 19,429\nAs of December 31, 2022, AES subsidiaries with facilities under construction had a total of approximately $283 million of committed but unused credit facilities available to fund construction and other related costs.

All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\nlimiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.","778":"Higher goodwill impairments in the current year;\nPrior year gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nHigher income tax expense;\nPrior year gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition date fair value;\nHigher Parent interest expense due to prior year realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, higher interest rates, and higher outstanding debt;\nLower margins at our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs, impacts of outages, and unrealized derivative losses;\nLower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; and\nOther-than-temporary impairment of sPower.\n93 | 2022 Annual Report\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nPrior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; and\nHigher margins at our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $455 million to a loss of $409 million in 2021, compared to income of $46 million in 2020.

AES holds a 49% ownership interest in the affiliate. The Company contributed $44 million to the joint venture as of December 31, 2021 and has contributed a total of $45 million as of December 31, 2022.

Impairment indicators were identified primarily as a result of inability to re-contract Guacoldas generation after expiration of its existing PPAs driven by lower energy prices in Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting from decarbonization initiatives of the Chilean Government. Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which negatively impacted the Company's Net equity in losses of affiliates by $127 million. As a result, the Companys basis in its investment in Guacolda was reduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was suspended.\nIn February 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement to sell its 50% ownership interest in Guacolda for $34 million. On July 20, 2021, the Company completed the sale, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $34 million, recorded in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests. Prior to its sale, the Guacolda equity method investment was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.","786":"133 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","787":"27. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","788":"10.3 Applied Energy Services, Inc.

All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\nlimiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.","793":"In February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived.

Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted our essential operations without significant disruption.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","812":"Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES holds a 75% ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development. AIMCo holds the remaining 25% minority interest along with certain partnership rights, though currently not in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future. AIMCos minority interest is recorded as temporary equity in Redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 16-Redeemable Stock of Subsidiaries for further information. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.","813":"In February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 425 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $600 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide any supporting information concerning the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nOn July 25, 2022, AES Puerto Rico, LP (AES-PR) received from the EPA an NOV alleging certain violations of the CAA at AES-PRs coal-fired power facility in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The NOV alleges AES-PR exceeded an emission limit and did not continuously operate certain monitoring equipment, conduct certain analyses and testing, maintain complete records, and submit certain reports as required by the EPAs Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The NOV further alleges AES-PR did not comply fully with the facilitys Title V operating permit. AES-PR is engaging in discussions with the EPA about the NOV. AES-PR will defend its interests, but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of CAA claims alleged against other coal-fired power plants have required companies to pay civil penalties and undertake remedial measures.","814":"Higher goodwill impairments in the current year;\nPrior year gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nHigher income tax expense;\nPrior year gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition date fair value;\nHigher Parent interest expense due to prior year realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, higher interest rates, and higher outstanding debt;\nLower margins at our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs, impacts of outages, and unrealized derivative losses;\nLower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; and\nOther-than-temporary impairment of sPower.\n93 | 2022 Annual Report\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nPrior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; and\nHigher margins at our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $455 million to a loss of $409 million in 2021, compared to income of $46 million in 2020.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominican peso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.\nConcentrations - Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and\/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms.\n28. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS","817":"Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.\nAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on\n123 | 2022 Annual Report","818":"- - 1\nChange in pension adjustments due to net actuarial gain (loss) for the period, net of income tax (expense) benefit of $(5), $(10), and $4, respectively\n13 26 (14)\nReclassification to earnings, net of income tax expense of $1, $3, and $0, respectively\n1 1 -\nTotal pension adjustments 14 27 (13)\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 748 292 (167)\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 243 (659) (15)\nLess: Comprehensive loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (127) 438 4\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION $ 116 $ (221) $ (11)\nSee Accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity\nYears ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nTHE AES CORPORATION STOCKHOLDERS\nPreferred Stock Common Stock Treasury Stock Additional\nPaid-In\nCapital Accumulated\nDeficit Accumulated\nOther\nComprehensive\nLoss Noncontrolling\nInterests\n(in millions) Shares Amount Shares Amount Shares Amount\nBalance at December 31, 2019 -

If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various\n74 | 2022 Annual Report","822":"Risks Related to our Indebtedness and Financial Condition\nWe have a significant amount of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $23 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\nlimiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.","823":"Executive Summary\nIn 2022, AES delivered on its strategic and financial objectives. We completed construction or the acquisition of 1.9 GW of renewables and energy storage, and signed long-term PPAs for an additional 5.2 GW of new renewable energy. See Overview of our Strategy included in Item 1.-Business of this Form 10-K for further information.\nCompared with last year, diluted loss per share from continuing operations increased $0.20, from $0.62 to $0.82. This loss increase reflects the prior year gains on remeasurement of our interest in sPower's development platform and the Fluence capital raise, higher income tax expense, lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, higher interest expense, and lower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; partially offset by the prior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, and higher margins from our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nAdjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure, increased $0.15, from $1.52 to $1.67, mainly driven by higher contributions from our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions and from our South America SBU due to higher margins and increased ownership in AES Andes, partially offset by lower contributions from our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs and impacts of outages, the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps at the Parent Company, and higher interest expense.\n84 | 2022 Annual Report\nReview of Consolidated Results of Operations\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 % Change 2022 vs. 2021 % Change 2021 vs. 2020\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenue:\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 5,013 $ 4,335 $ 3,918 16 % 11 %\nSouth America SBU 3,539 3,541 3,159 - % 12 %\nMCAC SBU 2,868 2,157 1,766 33 % 22 %","824":"Attorney-in-fact\nS-1 | 2022 Annual Report\nTHE AES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nSchedule I-Condensed Financial Information of Registrant\nS-2\nSchedules other than that listed above are omitted as the information is either not applicable, not required, or has been furnished in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto included in Item 8 hereof.\nSee Notes to Schedule I\nS-2 | 2022 Annual Report\nTHE AES CORPORATION\nSCHEDULE I CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF PARENT\nBALANCE SHEETS\nDECEMBER 31, 2022 AND 2021\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021\n(in millions)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 24 $ 40\nAccounts and notes receivable from subsidiaries 169 231\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 47 50\nTotal current assets 240 321\nInvestment in and advances to subsidiaries and affiliates 7,204 7,159\nOffice Equipment:\nCost 16 29\nAccumulated depreciation (10) (23)\nOffice equipment, net 6 6\nOther Assets:\nDeferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization of $9 and $7, respectively\n8 6\nOther assets 117 33\nTotal other assets 125 39\nTotal assets $ 7,575 $ 7,525\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 33 $ 17\nAccounts and notes payable to subsidiaries 609 161\nAccrued and other liabilities 319 340\nTotal current liabilities 961 518\nLong-term Liabilities:\nDebt 3,894 3,729\nOther long-term liabilities 283 480\nTotal long-term liabilities 4,177 4,209\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock 838 838\nCommon stock 8 8\nAdditional paid-in capital 6,688 7,106\nAccumulated deficit (1,635) (1,089)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (1,640) (2,220)\nTreasury stock (1,822) (1,845)\nTotal stockholders' equity 2,437 2,798\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 7,575 $ 7,525\nSee Notes to Schedule I.\nS-3 | 2022 Annual Report\nTHE AES CORPORATION\nSCHEDULE I CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF PARENT\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022, 2021, AND 2020\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020"}}
