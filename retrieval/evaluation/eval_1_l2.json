case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 16 percent. This decrease primarily reflects the deconsolidation of our German bottling operations in May 2016, a decline in CCR's unit case volume of 14 percent as well as a decline in China. The decline in CCR's unit case volume was primarily driven by North America refranchising activities. The unfavorable impact of these items on the group's unit case volume results was partially offset by growth in India and other markets where we own or otherwise consolidate bottling operations. The Company's consolidated bottling operations accounted for 33 percent and 67 percent of the unit case volume in China and India, respectively. CCR accounted for 51 percent of the total bottler-distributed unit case volume in North America.\nConcentrate Sales Volume\nIn 2017, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume were both even compared to 2016. In 2016, worldwide unit case sales volume grew 1 percent and concentrate sales volume was even compared to 2015. After considering the impact of structural changes, concentrate sales volume grew 1 percent during the year ended December 31, 2016. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments, structural changes and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an equity interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, beverage bases or powders.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Statements of Income\nPercent Change\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017 vs. 2016\n2016 vs. 2015\n(In millions except percentages and per share data)\nNET OPERATING REVENUES\n$\n35,410\n$\n41,863\n$\n44,294\n(15\n)%\n(5\n)%\nCost of goods sold\n13,256\n16,465\n17,482\n(19\n)\n(6\n)\nGROSS PROFIT\n22,154\n25,398\n26,812\n(13\n)\n(5\n)\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN\n62.6\n%\n60.7\n%\n60.5\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n12,496\n15,262\n16,427\n(18\n)\n(7\n)","1":"Net operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; acquisitions and divestitures; price, product and geographic mix; and foreign currency fluctuations.

This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss information, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company started a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $6,266 million and $185 million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the costs of factoring such receivables were not material.

When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable","24":"Evolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies.

The Company firmly believes that the IRS claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) issued an opinion (Opinion) predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Companys favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and\/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the\ntransition tax payable as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act).

The Company had $496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Companys effective tax rate.\nBased on current tax laws, the Companys effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION","38":"On December 22, 2017, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") was issued to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to finalize the calculations for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has determined that the net tax charge of $3.6 billion recorded in connection with the Tax Reform Act is a provisional amount and a reasonable estimate as of December 31, 2017. Additional work is necessary to finalize the calculations for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. Additionally, certain of our equity method investees are impacted by the Tax Reform Act and have recorded provisional tax amounts. To the extent their provisional amounts are refined in 2018, we will record our proportionate share in the line item equity income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its U.S. income tax return foreign subsidiary earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary's tangible assets. The Company has not yet elected an accounting policy related to how it will account for GILTI and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.0 percent in 2018. This estimated tax rate does not reflect the potential impact of further clarification of certain matters related to the Tax Reform Act and any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in 2018.\nOperations Review","39":"In the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\nThe Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest to determine the amount of compensation expense recognized each reporting period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end of the vesting period in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to Note 12.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based","40":"Tax Audits\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities, such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the quarter in which the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount, and\/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired.

The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. However, management believes that additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at some facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and\/or dispose of existing facilities.

If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively impacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on ESG matters. If, as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.\nAs the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our ESG goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various ESG reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs.","52":"Environmental and Social Matters\nAs investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on ESG issues, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among other things, environmental stewardship; social responsibility; diversity, equity and inclusion; and workplace rights.

We have established specific ESG goals related to water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of added sugar in our beverages; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable agriculture; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights.

We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in foreign currencies.\nIn 2017, we used 74 functional currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some of these currencies might be offset by strength in others. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\nAll operating currencies\n-\n%\n(5\n)%\n(15\n)%\nBrazilian real\n%\n(9\n)%\n(27\n)%\nMexican peso\n(2\n)\n(14\n)\n(16\n)\nAustralian dollar\n(1\n)\n(17\n)\nSouth African rand\n(13\n)\n(15\n)\nBritish pound\n(6\n)\n(11\n)\n(8\n)\nEuro\n-\n(17\n)\nJapanese yen\n(3\n)\n(14\n)\nThese percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on our net income and earnings per share.\nThe total currency impact on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 1 percent and 3 percent in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The total currency impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was nominal in 2017 and was a decrease of 12 percent in 2016.","56":"Cash Flow Hedging Strategy\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Companys foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $5,510 million and $7,399 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.","57":"The following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with \" ITEM 7.

While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Companys significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entitys voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a\nvariable interest is referred to as a VIE. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.","59":"6We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.\n7Represents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor.

Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\nObesity\nObesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a part of the solution.\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\noffer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\nprovide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\nprovide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\nmarket responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.","64":"As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $7.9 billion, of which $6.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $10.2 billion. Included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nIncluded in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.\nForeign Currency","65":"Note 8-STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nPreferred Stock\nWe have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock.

These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited.\nStock Repurchase Activity\nIn February 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $5.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. This stock repurchase authorization replaced the previous $2.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in 2010.

The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the estimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are recognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of each element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees.\nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some combination thereof.\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. Retail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or the customer. Amazons electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.","67":"We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This is principally due to our significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the related leases terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-term construction obligations are considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as Accrued expenses and other. Gross assets remaining under finance leases were $2.9 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2016 and 2017. Accumulated depreciation associated with finance leases was $361 million and $635 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017.\nNote 4-ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAcquisition Activity\nDuring 2015 and 2016, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $690 million and $103 million. The primary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.","68":"We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.","69":"The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased marketing expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $258 million and $(116) million for 2018 and 2019.\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth.

Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2016, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017, compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital.

As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nIn addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network.\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers.

Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\nThe Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\nWe expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.

Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2019, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $195 million, $385 million, and $775 million, recorded to Other income (expense), net.\nSee Item 7 of Part II, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nEquity Investment Risk\nAs of December 31, 2019, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $3.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $679 million of our investments as of December 31, 2019, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales\/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (foreign funds). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2019, of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $765 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of stockholders equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in Marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.","119":"As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\nUnearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 was $7.9 billion, of which $6.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2019 was $10.2 billion. Included in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nIncluded in Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.\nForeign Currency","120":"We Have Foreign Exchange Risk\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international websites and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and\/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P.

Our strategic investments include marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. We are required to record all adjustments to the value of these strategic investments through our consolidated statements of income (loss). As such, we expect volatility to our net income (loss) in future periods due to changes in fair value related to our investments in marketable equity securities and changes in observable prices related to our non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the Measurement Alternative. These changes could be material based on market conditions. Additionally, the financial success of our investments in privately held companies is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition, private sale, or other favorable market event providing the ability to realize appreciation in the value of the investment. A hypothetical adverse change of 10% in the carrying value of our strategic investments as of December 31, 2022, which could be experienced in the near term, would have resulted in an incremental decrease of approximately $215 million to the carrying value of the portfolio.

The number of times a consumer account or a merchant account transacts on our platform may vary significantly from the average number of payment transactions per active account.\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments platform, management uses these metrics to gain insights into the scale and strength of our payments platform, the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which may be indicators of current and future performance.

Our goal is to enable our merchants and consumers to manage and move their money anywhere in the world in the markets we serve, anytime, on any platform, and using any device when sending payments or getting paid, including person-to-person (P2P) payments.

Due to the nature of PayPals digital payments services, third parties may seek to engage in abusive schemes or fraud attacks that are often difficult to detect and may be deployed at a scale that would otherwise not be possible in physical transactions. Measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud and abusive behavior are complex, require continuous improvement, and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud, particularly new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new or expanded product offerings. If these measures are not effective, our business could be negatively impacted. We also incur substantial losses from erroneous transactions and situations where funding instruments used for legitimate transactions are closed or have insufficient funds to satisfy payments, or the payment is initiated to an unintended recipient in error. Numerous and evolving fraud schemes and misuse of our payments services could subject us to significant costs and liabilities, require us to change our business practices, cause us to incur significant remediation costs, lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services, damage our reputation and brands, divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, and result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our customers and their business partners as a result of losses or claims.","152":"Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, loans and interest receivable, net, funds receivable and customer accounts, long-term investments, and long-term notes receivable, are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk.

Many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages or penalties or may require us to change or adopt certain business practices. If we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements at that time. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable, we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding (i.e., monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement) are not material. If we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding, we have disclosed that fact. In assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding, we evaluate, among other factors, the amount of monetary damages claimed, as well as the potential impact of non-monetary remedies sought by plaintiffs (e.g., injunctive relief) that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note 13, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such non-monetary remedies.","164":"Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nCustomers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices, including with respect to global talent, cybersecurity, data privacy and protection and climate change. If we do not adapt to and comply with new laws and regulations or changes to legal or regulatory requirements concerning ESG matters, or fail to meet rapidly evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, our reputation may be harmed, customers may choose to refrain from using our products and services, and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.

Our operating margin was 14% and 17% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Operating margin for 2022 was negatively impacted primarily by increases in transaction expense and transaction and credit losses.","167":"Income tax expense (benefit)\nOur effective income tax rate was 28% in 2022 and (2)% in 2021. The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions and an increase in tax expense related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property. See Note 16-Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including our customer protection programs, credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs.

If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rates payable by us under our indebtedness may increase, and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws, exposure to unanticipated additional tax liabilities, or implementation of reporting or record-keeping obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn increasing number of U.S. states, the U.S. federal government, and governments of foreign jurisdictions, such as the EU Commission, as well as international organizations, such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, are focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. For example, various countries have proposed or enacted digital services taxes. These actions may materially affect our effective tax rate.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are currently undergoing a number of investigations, audits, and reviews by tax authorities in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities that differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, which may, individually or in the aggregate, materially affect our financial results in the periods for which such determination is made. While we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, these reserves may prove to be insufficient.","169":"We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nBased on our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $34 million.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES","170":"Outstanding at January 1, 2022 339 $ 17.55\nAssumed 3 $ 55.55\nExercised (190) $ 20.62\nForfeited\/expired\/cancelled (11) $ 13.66\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 141 $ 14.56 4.93 $ 8,080\nExpected to vest 24 $ 23.89 7.46 $ 1,172\nOptions exercisable 117 $ 12.60 4.40 $ 6,875\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of options assumed from acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $147.92, $237.26 and $108.61, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying options and the quoted price of our common stock at December 31, 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the Plan was $16 million, $81 million, and $66 million, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise.

We capitalized $511 million and $462 million of internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $426 million, $366 million, and $322 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software and website development costs are expensed as incurred.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease for accounting purposes at contract inception. Operating leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets, which are included in other assets, and lease liabilities, which are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and deferred tax liability and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. For sale-leaseback transactions, we evaluate the sale and the lease arrangement based on our conclusion as to whether control of the underlying asset has been transferred, and recognize the sale-leaseback as either a sale transaction or under the financing method. The financing method requires the asset to remain on our consolidated balance sheets throughout the term of the lease and the proceeds to be recognized as a financing obligation.","172":"We have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes. The arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (Aggregate Cash Deposits). The arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of $1.7 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $1.7 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement.\nCredit ratings\nAs of December 31, 2022, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poors Financial Services, LLC, Fitch Ratings, Inc., and Moodys Investors Services Inc.

Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on borrowings under our credit agreements.\nCURRENT AND FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS\nOur material cash requirements include funds to support current and potential: operating activities, credit products, customer protection programs, stock repurchases, strategic investments, acquisitions, other commitments, and capital expenditures and other future obligations.\nCredit products","173":"those technologies may be regulated.

A deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could increase the risk of lower consumer spending, merchant and consumer bankruptcy, insolvency, business failure, higher credit losses, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, or other business interruption, which may adversely impact our business. If these conditions continue or worsen, they could adversely impact our future operating results.\nOVERVIEW OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nYear Ended December 31, Percent Increase\/(Decrease)\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021\n(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts)\nNet revenues $ 27,518 $ 25,371 $ 21,454 8 % 18 %\nOperating expenses 23,681 21,109 18,165 12 % 16 %\nOperating income 3,837 4,262 3,289 (10) % 30 %\nOperating margin 14 % 17 % 15 % ** **\nOther income (expense), net (471) (163) 1,776 189 % (109) %\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 947 (70) 863 ** (108) %\nEffective tax rate 28 % (2) % 17 % ** **\nNet income (loss) $ 2,419 $ 4,169 $ 4,202 (42) % (1) %","185":"We have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures, manage these exposures, and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the execution of foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments; for additional details related to our foreign currency exchange contracts, please see Note 10-Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiaries from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenues denominated in foreign currencies and net investment hedges for accounting purposes. The derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI. Cash flow hedges are subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The accumulated gains and losses associated with net investment hedges will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are sold or substantially liquidated, at which point they will be reclassified into earnings.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by a hypothetical 10% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign currency exchange forward contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $710 million and $512 million lower, respectively, before considering the offsetting impact of the underlying hedged item.","186":"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate or assumption is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk, and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in Note 1-Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent managements predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and such estimates require regular review and adjustment.\nALLOWANCE FOR TRANSACTION AND CREDIT LOSSES","187":"Transition tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Act.\nLong-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt.

In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A.

Online advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of the individual agreements, which are generally over the greater of the ratio of the number of impressions delivered over the total number of contracted impressions, on a pay-per-click basis, or on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Advertising expense totaled $518 million, $740 million, and $654 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nDefined contribution savings plans\nWe have a defined contribution savings plan in the U.S. which qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Our non-U.S. employees are covered by other savings plans. Expenses related to our defined contribution savings plans are recorded when services are rendered by our employees.\nStock-based compensation\nWe determine compensation expense associated with restricted stock units, performance based restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards based on the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. We determine compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We generally recognize compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.

We experienced robust growth in organic net sales in North America Retail, aided by our ability to meet the pandemic-related increase in demand for meals and baking categories during the fourth quarter, as well as consistently strong results in U.S. cereal and important improvements in U.S. snack bars and U.S. yogurt throughout the year. We exceeded our organic net sales growth goal for our Pet segment, driven by a successful expansion of BLUE into additional customer outlets and a significant increase in household penetration for the brand. Organic net sales results in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice, Europe & Australia, and Asia & Latin America segments were below fiscal 2019 levels, due to a slow start to the year in each of those segments, as well as the pandemic-related headwinds impacting Convenience Stores & Foodservice and Asia & Latin America in the second half of the year.\nSecond, we maintained our strong adjusted operating profit margins.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","202":"We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

ITEM 2 Properties","221":"We successfully transitioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales and segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion.","222":"principles (GAAP).\nGuidelines, procedures,\nand practices\nthat we\nare required\nto use\nin recording\nand reporting accounting information in our financial statements.\nGoodwill.\nThe difference\nbetween the purchase\nprice of acquired\ncompanies plus the fair\nvalue of any redeemable\nand noncontrolling\ninterests and the related fair values of net assets acquired.\nGross margin.\nNet sales less cost of sales.\nHedge accounting.\nAccounting for qualifying\nhedges that allows changes in\na hedging instruments\nfair value to offset\ncorresponding\nchanges in\nthe hedged\nitem in\nthe same\nreporting period\n.\nHedge accounting\nis permitted\nfor certain\nhedging instruments\nand hedged\nitems\nonly\nif\nthe\nhedging\nrelationship\nis\nhighly\neffective,\nand\nonly\nprospectively\nfrom\nthe\ndate\na\nhedging\nrelationship\nis\nformally\ndocumented.\nHolistic Margin Management\n(HMM).\nCompany-wide initiative to\nuse productivity savings, mix\nmanagement,\nand price realization\nto offset input cost inflation, protect margins\n,\nand generate funds to reinvest in sales-generating activities.\nInterest\nbearing\ninstruments.\nNotes\npayable,\nlong-term\ndebt,\nincluding\ncurrent\nportion,\ncash\nand\ncash\nequivalents,\nand\ncertain\ninterest bearing investments classified within prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets.\nLIBOR.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate.\nMark-to-market.\nThe act of determining a value for\nfinancial instruments, commodity contracts, and\nrelated assets or liabilities based\non the current market price for that item.\nNet debt.\nLong-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and notes payable,\nless cash and cash equivalents.\nNet debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio.\nNet debt divided by Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet\nmark-to-market\nvaluation of\ncertain\ncommodity\npositions.\nRealized\nand\nunrealized\ngains\nand\nlosses on\nderivative\ncontracts\nthat will be allocated to segment operating profit when the exposure we are hedging\naffects earnings.\nNet price realization.","223":"executive management and as a\ncomponent of the measurement of\nour\nperformance for\nincentive compensation purposes.\nWe\nbelieve that\nthis measure provides\nuseful information\nto investors because\nit is\nthe\noperating\nprofit\nmeasure\nwe\nuse\nto\nevaluate\noperating\nprofit\nperformance\non\na\ncomparable\nyear-to-year\nbasis.\nAdditionally,\nthe\nmeasure\nis\nevaluated\non\na\nconstant-currency\nbasis\nby\nexcluding\nthe\neffect\nthat\nforeign\ncurrency\nexchange\nrate\nfluctuations\nhave\non\nyear-to-year comparability given the volatility in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates.\nOur adjusted operating profit growth on a constant-currency basis is calculated\nas follows:\nFiscal Year\nChange\nOperating profit as reported\n$\n3,475.8\n$\n3,144.8\n%\nDivestitures (gain) loss\n(194.1)\n53.5\nMark-to-market effects\n(133.1)\n(138.8)\nTransaction costs\n72.8\n9.5\nRestructuring (recoveries) charges\n(23.2)\n172.7\nAcquisition integration costs\n22.4\n-\nNon-income tax recovery\n(22.0)\n(8.8)\nInvestment activity, net\n14.7\n(76.4)\nProduct recall adjustment, net\n-\n(3.5)\nAdjusted operating profit\n$\n3,213.3\n$\n3,153.2\n%\nForeign currency exchange impact\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit growth, on a constant-currency basis\n%\nNote: Table may not foot due to rounding.\nFor more information on the reconciling items, please refer to the Significant Items Impacting Comparability section above.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate\nThis measure\nis used in\nreporting to\nour Board of\nDirectors and executive\nmanagement.

Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.","225":"We are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2021. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan.","252":"During fiscal 2019, the increase in defined benefit pension benefit obligations was primarily driven by actuarial losses due to a decrease in the discount rate. The decrease in other postretirement obligations was primarily driven by a decrease in expected future claims, partially offset by losses due to a decrease in the discount rate.\nAs of May 31, 2020, other postretirement benefit plans had benefit obligations of $479.4 million that exceeded plan assets of $248.0 million. As of May 26, 2019, other postretirement benefit plans had benefit obligations of $498.4 million that exceeded plan assets of $233.7 million. Postemployment benefit plans are not funded and had benefit obligations of $150.3 million and $128.0 million as of May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019, respectively.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $7,285.2 million as of May 31, 2020, and $6,436.9 million as of May 26, 2019.\nAmounts recognized in AOCI as of May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019, are as follows:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nTotal\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet actuarial (loss) gain\n$\n(2,136.6)\n$\n(1,961.6)\n$\n129.5\n$\n81.0\n$\n(15.4)\n$\n0.1\n$\n(2,022.5)\n$\n(1,880.5)\nPrior service (costs) credits\n(6.0)\n(5.9)\n21.0\n26.3\n(5.3)\n(6.0)\n9.7\n14.4\nAmounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(2,142.6)\n$\n(1,967.5)\n$\n150.5\n$\n107.3\n$\n(20.7)\n$\n(5.9)\n$\n(2,012.8)\n$\n(1,866.1)\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of May 31, 2020 and May 26, 2019 are as follows:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n3,512.9\n$\n589.7\nAccumulated benefit obligation\n3,200.1\n552.2\nPlan assets at fair value\n2,569.9\n14.4\nComponents of net periodic benefit expense are as follows:\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions","253":"Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business.

For fiscal 2017, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs in the Walmart U.S. segment.

For fiscal 2017, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in wage expense at the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments resulting from the continued investment in associate wage structure, a $370 million charge related to discontinued domestic real estate projects and severance, and our","262":"Cost of Sales\nCost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs from suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the cost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.

For fiscal 2020, the decreases were primarily the result of continued price investments which were partially offset by better merchandise mix, including strength in private brands, and less pressure from transportation costs. For fiscal 2019, the decrease was primarily due to our planned pricing strategy, increased transportation expenses, and the mix effects from our growing eCommerce business.","267":"Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019, 30.4% for fiscal 2018, and 30.3% for fiscal 2017. Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.

Transactions with noncontrolling interests are also classified as cash flows from financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities increased $0.8 billion and $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2018 increased due to premiums paid for early extinguishment of debt. Net cash used in financing\nactivities for fiscal 2017 increased primarily due to repurchases of Company stock partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt. Further discussion of financing activities is provided by major category below.\nShort-term Borrowings","271":"We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. We had net cash provided by operating activities of $27.8 billion, $28.3 billion and $31.7 billion for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We generated free cash flow of $17.4 billion, $18.3 billion and $21.1 billion for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from U.S. tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 (\"Tax Reform\") and the timing of tax payments. Free cash flow for fiscal 2019 declined when compared to fiscal 2018 due to the same reasons as the decline in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $0.3 billion in increased capital expenditures. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017 were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payments, as well as lapping the previous year's improvements in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulations adopted in fiscal 2017.\nWalmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions.

All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2018 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents","281":"-\n7,476\n7,476\nPayments of long-term debt\n(1,789\n)\n(11,272\n)\n(13,061\n)\nReclassifications of long-term debt\n3,224\n(3,224\n)\n-\nOther\n1,050\n1,097\nBalances as of January 31, 2018\n$\n3,738\n$\n30,045\n$\n33,783\nOur total long-term debt decreased $4.5 billion for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the extinguishment and maturities of certain long-term debt, partially offset by the issuance of long-term debt.

Management completed the Company's accounting for Tax Reform in fiscal 2019 based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. The net tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Act was $207 million, and in fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $442 million of additional tax expense related to the Tax Act, included as a component of provision for income taxes.","299":"-\n13,682\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,552\n28,316\n31,181\nChanges in currency translation and other\n-\n(149\n)\n-\n(149\n)\nAcquisitions\n-\n-\nBalances as of January 31, 2020\n$\n2,593\n$\n28,167\n$\n$\n31,073\n(1) Goodwill recorded in fiscal 2019 for Walmart International relates to Flipkart.\nIntangible assets are included in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which primarily impacted the Company's accounting for its investment in JD.com, Inc. (\"JD\") and resulted in a positive adjustment to retained earnings of approximately $2.6 billion, net of tax, in fiscal 2019 based on the market value of the Company's investment in JD as of January 31, 2018. The adoption required prospective changes in fair value of the Company's investment in JD to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, which the Company classifies in other gains and losses.","300":"In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows-Restricted Cash (Topic 230), which requires restricted cash to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts on the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this ASU on February 1, 2018, which, while immaterial, will modify the Company's presentation of Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. At January 31, 2018, the Company had restricted cash recorded in line items other than cash and cash equivalents of $258 million.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2018-02, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The ASU provides that the stranded tax effects from the Tax Act in accumulated other comprehensive loss may be reclassified to retained earnings. The ASU is effective February 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Management anticipates early adopting this optional standard and is evaluating the effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOther Pronouncements Being Evaluated\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which requires lease assets and liabilities to be recorded on the balance sheet. Certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures are also required, as well as retrospective recognition and measurement of impacted leases. The Company will adopt this ASU on February 1, 2019 and is implementing new lease systems in connection with the adoption. Management is progressing with implementation and continuing to evaluate the effect to the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. Management expects a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet.","301":"Net Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(9,128\n)\n$\n(24,036\n)\n$\n(9,079\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities was $9.1 billion, $24.0 billion and $9.1 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies, remodel existing stores and club and add new stores and clubs.

In preparing the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements. These judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes. Actual results may differ from our estimates.\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies, how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements. Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements.\nInventories\nWe value inventories at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") method for Walmart U.S. segment's inventories. The inventory at the Sam's Club segment is valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. When necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end. Our LIFO provision is calculated based on inventory levels, markup rates and internally generated retail price indices. As a measure of sensitivity, a 1% increase to our retail price indices would not have resulted in a decrease to the carrying value of inventory. As of January 31, 2020 and 2019, our inventories valued at LIFO approximated those inventories as if they were valued at FIFO.\nImpairment of Assets","317":"Cash Equivalents and Working Capital\nCash and cash equivalents were $7.7 billion and $6.8 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion and $18.9 billion as of January 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases. The decreased working capital deficit as of January 31, 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher current assets as a result of the consolidation of Flipkart.\nHistorically, we have used intercompany financing arrangements to make cash available in the country in which it is needed with the minimum cost possible. During fiscal 2019, we repatriated to the U.S. $5.3 billion of cash at a tax cost of approximately $40 million.\nAs of January 31, 2019 and 2018, cash and cash equivalents of $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions. Of the $2.8 billion as of January 31, 2019, approximately $1.2 billion can only be accessed through dividends or intercompany financing arrangements subject to approval of the Flipkart minority shareholders; however, this cash is expected to be utilized to fund the operations of Flipkart.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(24,036\n)\n$\n(9,079\n)\n$\n(13,896\n)","318":"Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n25,255\n$\n27,753\n$\n28,337\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $25.3 billion, $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020 decreased when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the contribution to our Asda pension plan in anticipation of its future settlement, the inclusion of a full year of Flipkart operations, and the timing of vendor payments. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2019, when compared to the previous fiscal year, was primarily due to timing of vendor payments, partially offset by lower tax payments mainly resulting from Tax Reform and the timing of tax payments.\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit\nCash and cash equivalents were $9.5 billion and $7.7 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our working capital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.0 billion and $15.6 billion as of January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.","319":"Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\nWith Fuel\nFuel Impact\nWalmart U.S.\n3.7%\n2.1%\n0.1%\n0.1%\nSam's Club\n5.4%\n2.8%\n1.6%\n1.0%\nTotal U.S.\n4.0%\n2.2%\n0.4%\n0.2%\nWalmart U.S. comparable sales increased 3.7% and 2.1% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, driven by ticket and traffic growth.

At times, we make strategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company, which may not benefit comparable sales in the near term.\nComparable sales is a metric which indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar.

The success of this strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and is further subject to the risks we face as outlined in this Item 1A. As a result, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations.\nFurthermore, the cost of certain eCommerce and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred by acquired eCommerce businesses will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\nThe performance of strategic alliances to support the expansion of our Walmart International segment could materially adversely affect our financial performance.","323":"Corporate - - - 123 127 155\nTotal $ 91 $ 90 $ 81 $ 2,619 $ 2,458 $ 2,351\nNet revenue and long-lived assets by country are as follows:\nNet Revenue Long-Lived Assets(a)\n2021 2020 2019 2021 2020\nUnited States $ 44,545 $ 40,800 $ 38,644 $ 36,324 $ 36,657\nMexico 4,580 3,924 4,190 1,720 1,708\nRussia 3,426 3,009 3,263 3,751 3,644\nCanada 3,405 2,989 2,831 2,846 2,794\nChina (b)\n2,679 1,732 1,300 1,745 1,649\nUnited Kingdom 2,102 1,882 1,723 906 874\nSouth Africa (c)\n2,008 1,282 405 1,389 1,484\nAll other countries 16,729 14,754 14,805 13,399 13,423\nTotal $ 79,474 $ 70,372 $ 67,161 $ 62,080 $ 62,233\n(a)Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates.

We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.\nUnrecognized tax benefits","344":"Fiscal years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019\n(in millions)\n2021 2020 2019\nFinancing Activities\nProceeds from issuances of long-term debt $ 4,122 $ 13,809 $ 4,621\nPayments of long-term debt (3,455) (1,830) (3,970)\nCash tender offers\/debt redemption (4,844) (1,100) (1,007)\nShort-term borrowings, by original maturity:\nMore than three months - proceeds 8 4,077 6\nMore than three months - payments (397) (3,554) (2)\nThree months or less, net 434 (109) (3)\nPayments of acquisition-related contingent consideration\n(773) - -\nCash dividends paid (5,815) (5,509) (5,304)\nShare repurchases - common (106) (2,000) (3,000)\nProceeds from exercises of stock options 185 179 329\nWithholding tax payments on restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) converted (92) (96) (114)\nOther financing (47) (48) (45)\nNet Cash (Used for)\/Provided by Financing Activities (10,780) 3,819 (8,489)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (114) (129) 78\nNet (Decrease)\/Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (2,547) 2,684 (5,199)\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash, Beginning of Year 8,254 5,570 10,769\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash, End of Year $ 5,707 $ 8,254 $ 5,570\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nDecember 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020\n(in millions except per share amounts)\n2021 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 5,596 $ 8,185\nShort-term investments\n392 1,366\nAccounts and notes receivable, net\n8,680 8,404\nInventories\n4,347 4,172\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 980 874\nAssets held for sale 1,788 -\nTotal Current Assets\n21,783 23,001\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net 22,407 21,369\nAmortizable Intangible Assets, net 1,538 1,703\nGoodwill 18,381 18,757\nOther Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 17,127 17,612","345":"We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart.

Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed.

We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.\nTax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020.

We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nTaxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.","364":"Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nTaxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce\/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Italy enacted a flat tax on all beverages, including zero calorie beverages, effective January 1, 2023, at a rate of EUR 10 cent (0.11 U.S. dollars) per liter.

We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment,\nhistorical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.","366":"Software Costs\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $135 million in 2021, $152 million in 2020 and $166 million in 2019. Net capitalized software and development costs were $809 million and $664 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations.

Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve or properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation.

Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled.\nThese accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined.

For Lunchables, the reduction in fair value was also due to lower forecasted net sales and royalty rate assumptions associated with lower profit margin expectations driven by pricing actions at certain customers. For Velveeta, Philadelphia, and Cool Whip, no assumption changes other than the discount rate had a meaningful impact on the estimated fair value of brands. Since these valuation assumption changes were made in connection with the annual impairment test in the second quarter of 2019 and were not indicative of events or conditions that would have constituted a triggering event during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded the non-cash impairment loss in the second quarter of 2019. These brands had an aggregate carrying value of $13.5 billion prior to this impairment and $13.0 billion after impairment.\nThe aggregate carrying amount associated with an additional three brands (Kraft, Planters, and ABC), which each had excess fair value over its carrying amount of 10% or less, was $13.4 billion as of the annual impairment test date. The aggregate carrying amount of an additional three brands (Oscar Mayer, Jet Puffed, and Quero), which each had fair value over its carrying amount of between 10-20%, was $3.6 billion as of the annual impairment test date. The aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount between 20-50% was $4.2 billion, and the aggregate carrying amount of brands with fair value over carrying amount in excess of 50% was $9.3 billion as of the annual impairment test date.","393":"Other expense\/(income) was $168 million of income in 2018 compared to $627 million of income in 2017. This decrease was primarily due to a $162 million non-cash settlement charge in 2018 related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans compared to a $177 million non-cash curtailment gain from postretirement plan remeasurements in 2017.

This decrease was primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix (2.4 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (0.4 pp). Unfavorable volume\/mix was primarily due to unfavorable changes in retail inventory levels versus the prior year and lower shipments in meat, cheese, and coffee, partially offset by growth in nuts as well as condiments and sauces. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases to reflect higher key-commodity costs for meat and cheese, which more than offset lower key-commodity driven pricing on coffee and nuts.","395":"Management does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or allocate resources.

This increase was primarily driven by higher collections on trade receivables resulting from the reduction of receivables recorded as a non-cash exchange for sold receivables as we unwound all of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the Programs) in 2018 and as our trade receivables balance was higher at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. This increase was partially offset by a federal tax refund received in the prior year, tax payments associated with the Heinz India Transaction, and increased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2019. See Note 16, Financing Arrangements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our Programs.\nNet Cash Provided by\/Used for Investing Activities:\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 28, 2019 compared to $288 million for the year ended December 29, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds from our Canada Natural Cheese Transaction and Heinz India Transaction, proceeds from our net investment hedges, lower capital expenditures, and lower cash payments to acquire businesses year over year. These increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by lower cash collections on previously sold receivables, as we unwound all of our Programs in 2018. We expect 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $750 million.

This increase was primarily driven by higher collections on trade receivables resulting from the reduction of receivables recorded as a non-cash exchange for sold receivables as we unwound all of our accounts receivable securitization and factoring programs (the Programs) in 2018 and as our trade receivables balance was higher at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. This increase was partially offset by a federal tax refund received in the prior year, tax payments associated with the Heinz India Transaction, and increased cash payments for employee bonuses in 2019. See Note 16, Financing Arrangements, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information on our Programs.\nNet Cash Provided by\/Used for Investing Activities:\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion for the year ended December 28, 2019 compared to $288 million for the year ended December 29, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds from our Canada Natural Cheese Transaction and Heinz India Transaction, proceeds from our net investment hedges, lower capital expenditures, and lower cash payments to acquire businesses year over year. These increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by lower cash collections on previously sold receivables, as we unwound all of our Programs in 2018. We expect 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $750 million.

Factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as weather, raw material shortages, natural disasters, fires or explosions, political unrest, terrorism, generalized labor unrest, or health pandemics, such as the new coronavirus that originated in China, could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers, co-manufacturers or distributors operations. These disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network. If we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations, whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations, or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information, production, or supply systems, we may be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders, inventory, receivables, and payables. If that occurs, our customers confidence in us and long-term demand for our products could decline. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nBusiness Risks\nWe may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures, joint ventures, or other investments.","412":"We must leverage our brand value to compete against private label products.\nIn nearly all of our product categories, we compete with branded products as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. Our products must provide higher value and\/or quality to our consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and\/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories, increase our market share, or add products that are in faster-growing and more profitable categories.\nOur future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate. Our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster-growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. Our failure to drive revenue growth, limit market share decreases in our key product categories, or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results.\nProduct recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect us.","413":"Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and\/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings.","414":"Industry Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences.\nWe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures, including pressures in relation to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives.\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.","415":"Our issued patents extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent application filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage as determined by the patent office or courts in the country, and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development focuses on achieving the following four objectives:\nproduct innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs and drive growth;\nworld-class and uncompromising food safety, quality, and consistency;\nsuperior, customer-preferred product and package performance; and\ncontinuous process improvement and product optimization in pursuit of cost reductions.\nCompetition\nOur products are sold in highly competitive marketplaces, which have experienced increased concentration and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers, large-format retailers, and discounters. Competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies. We compete with both branded and private label products sold by retailers, wholesalers, and cooperatives. We compete on the basis of product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences. Improving our market position or introducing new products requires substantial advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and Customers","416":"Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and brands requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. These assumptions and estimates include estimated future annual net cash flows, income tax considerations, discount rates, growth rates, royalty rates, contributory asset charges, and other market factors. If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, if market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates, change, or if managements expectations or plans otherwise change, including as a result of updates to our global five-year operating plan, then one or more of our reporting units or brands might become impaired in the future, which could negatively affect our operating results or net worth. We are currently actively reviewing the enterprise strategy for the Company. As part of this strategic review, we expect to develop updates to the five-year operating plan in 2020, which could impact the allocation of investments among reporting units and brands and impact growth expectations and fair value estimates. Additionally, as a result of this strategic review process, we could decide to divest certain non-strategic assets. As a result, the ongoing development of the enterprise strategy and underlying detailed business plans could lead to the impairment of one or more of our reporting units or brands in the future.","417":"The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the brands. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing our procedures related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and in evaluating managements cash flow projections and significant assumptions, including net sales, cost of products sold, SG&A, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the excess earnings method and net sales, royalty rates, long-term growth rates and discount rates for the relief from royalty method. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained. As previously disclosed by management, a material weakness existed during the year related to this matter.","418":"As previously disclosed on February 21, 2019, we received a subpoena in October 2018 from the SEC related to our procurement area, specifically the accounting policies, procedures, and internal controls related to our procurement function, including, but not limited to, agreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to agreements with our suppliers. Following the receipt of this subpoena, we, together with external counsel and forensic accountants, and subsequently, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, conducted an internal investigation into our procurement area and related matters. The SEC has issued additional subpoenas seeking information related to our financial reporting, internal controls, disclosures, our assessment of goodwill and intangible asset impairments, our communications with certain shareholders, and other procurement-related information and materials in connection with its investigation. The United States Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Illinois (USAO) is also reviewing this matter. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are currently defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit, a class action lawsuit brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a consolidated stockholder derivative action pending in federal court, and eight stockholder derivative actions pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\nWe are cooperating with the SEC and USAO, and intend to vigorously defend the civil lawsuits. We are unable, at this time, to estimate our potential liability in these matters. In connection with the securities and ERISA class action lawsuits and the stockholder derivative actions, we may be required to pay judgments, settlements, or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for additional information.","419":"Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations. Management believes that presenting our non-GAAP financial measures (i.e., Organic Net Sales, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS) is useful to investors because it (i) provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nOrganic Net Sales is defined as net sales excluding, when they occur, the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, and a 53rd week of shipments. We calculate the impact of currency on net sales by holding exchange rates constant at the previous years exchange rate, with the exception of highly inflationary subsidiaries, for which we calculate the previous years results using the current years exchange rate. Organic Net Sales is a tool that can assist management and investors in comparing our performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations.","420":"The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessment is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the brands.

The complaints allege that the defendant 3G Entities were controlling shareholders who owed fiduciary duties to the Company, and that they breached those duties by allegedly engaging in insider trading and misappropriating the Companys material, non-public information. The complaints allege the remaining defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by purportedly making materially misleading statements and omissions regarding the Companys financial performance and the impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets, and by purportedly approving or allowing the 3G Entities alleged insider trading. The complaints seek relief against the defendants in the form of damages, disgorgement of all profits obtained from the alleged insider trading, and an award of attorneys fees and costs.\nWe intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits; however, we cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss, if any, due to the early stage of these proceedings.\nUnited States Government Investigations:","422":"We seek to maintain, extend, and expand our brand image through marketing investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, and product innovation. Negative perceptions on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image or lead to stricter regulations and scrutiny of marketing practices. Moreover, adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us, our quality and safety, our environmental or social impacts, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers confidence, and reduce demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Furthermore, existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising, consumer promotions, and marketing, or our response to those restrictions, could limit our efforts to maintain, extend, and expand our brands.\nIn addition, our success in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment. We increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. The growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information, including misinformation, and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands or our products, or our suppliers and, in some cases, our competitors, on social or digital media, whether or not valid, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. In addition, we might fail to appropriately target our marketing efforts, anticipate consumer preferences, or invest sufficiently in maintaining, extending, and expanding our brand image. If we do not maintain, extend, and expand our reputation or brand image, then our product sales, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.","423":"As a large, global food and beverage company, we operate in a highly-regulated environment with constantly-evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Various laws and regulations govern production, storage, distribution, sales, advertising, labeling, including on-pack claims, information or disclosures, marketing, licensing, trade, labor, tax, environmental matters, privacy, as well as health and safety and data protection practices. Government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations. In particular, Brexit could result in a new regulatory regime in the United Kingdom that may or may not follow that of the European Union, and the creation of new and divergent laws and regulations could increase the cost and complexity of our compliance. In addition, this shift in regime could create a number of legal and accounting complexities with respect to existing relationships, including uncertainty regarding the continuity of contracts entered into by entities in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Our compliance with new or revised laws and regulations, or the interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations, could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations. As a consequence of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate, we are faced with a heightened risk of legal claims and regulatory enforcement actions.","424":"Other expense\/(income) was $952 million of income in 2019 compared to $168 million of income in 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a $420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 compared to a $15 million loss on sale of our South Africa subsidiary in 2018, a $162 million non-cash settlement charge in the prior year related to the wind-up of our Canadian salaried and Canadian hourly defined benefit pension plans, and a $136 million decrease in nonmonetary currency devaluation losses related to our Venezuelan operations as compared to the prior year period. The $420 million net gain on sales of businesses in 2019 consisted of a $249 million gain on the sale of Heinz India Private Limited (Heinz India) (Heinz India Transaction), a $242 million gain on the sale of certain assets in our natural cheese business in Canada (Canada Natural Cheese Transaction), and a $71 million loss on an anticipated sale of a subsidiary within our Rest of World segment.\nThe effective tax rate was 27.4% in 2019 on pre-tax income compared to 9.4% in 2018 on a pre-tax loss. The 2019 effective tax rate was higher primarily driven by lower non-deductible goodwill impairments, partially offset by a more favorable geographic mix of pre-tax income in various non-U.S. jurisdictions and a decrease in unfavorable rate reconciling items. Current year unfavorable impacts primarily related to non-deductible goodwill impairments, the impact of the federal tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), an increase in uncertain tax position reserves, the establishment of certain state valuation allowance reserves, and the tax impacts from the Heinz India and Canada Natural Cheese Transactions. These impacts were partially offset by the reversal of certain withholding tax obligations and changes in estimates of certain 2018 U.S. income and deductions.","425":"Provision for\/(Benefit from) Income Taxes:\nIncome\/(loss) before income taxes and the provision for\/(benefit from) income taxes, consisted of the following (in millions):\nDecember 28, 2019\nDecember 29, 2018\nDecember 30, 2017\nIncome\/(loss) before income taxes:\nUnited States\n$\n$\n(10,305\n)\n$\n3,811\nInternational\n1,865\n(1,016\n)\n1,639\nTotal\n$\n2,661\n$\n(11,321\n)\n$\n5,450\nProvision for\/(benefit from) income taxes:\nCurrent:\nU.S. federal\n$\n$\n$\nU.S. state and local\n(47\n)\nInternational\n1,021\n1,013\nDeferred:\nU.S. federal\n(209\n)\n(1,843\n)\n(6,590\n)\nU.S. state and local\n(7\n)\n(121\n)\nInternational\n(77\n)\n(3\n)\n(2\n)\n(293\n)\n(1,967\n)\n(6,495\n)\nTotal provision for\/(benefit from) income taxes\n$\n$\n(1,067\n)\n$\n(5,482\n)\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we prospectively adopted ASU 2016-09.

This increase was primarily driven by higher repayments of long-term debt and higher debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, primarily related to our tender offers in September 2019 and debt redemptions in October 2019. These increases to net cash used for financing activities were partially offset by decreased cash distributions related to our dividends and lower net repayments of commercial paper.

Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. We compete based on product innovation, price, product quality, nutritional value, service, taste, convenience, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and distribution, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy changing consumer preferences.\nWe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures, including pressures in relation to private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. These pressures have restricted and may in the future continue to restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases. Failure to effectively assess, timely change and set proper pricing, promotions, or trade incentives may negatively impact the achievement of our objectives.\nThe rapid emergence of new distribution channels, particularly e-commerce, may create consumer price deflation, affecting our retail customer relationships and presenting additional challenges to increasing prices in response to commodity or other cost increases. We may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, materials, advertising, and new product or channel innovation to maintain or increase market share. These expenditures are subject to risks, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts. If we are unable to compete effectively, our profitability, financial condition, and operating results may decline.\nOur success depends on our ability to correctly predict, identify, and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand, to offer new products to meet those changes, and to respond to competitive innovation.","440":"Employees\nWe had approximately 37,000 employees as of December 28, 2019.\nRegulation\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer food and beverage products is highly regulated.

These laws and regulations are administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets where our products are manufactured, distributed or sold. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside of the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, health and safety, anti-corruption, and data privacy. In our business dealings, we are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, and various other anti-corruption regulations in the regions in which we operate. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business.

Following this reorganization, we established a new management team in the region at the beginning of 2019 that developed a new five-year operating plan for the region, which established a revised downward outlook for net sales, margin, and cash flows in response to lower expectations for margin and revenue growth opportunities in the region. As a result of this planning process, management revised its expectations downward in relation to the anticipated long-term impact of white space growth opportunities in Middle East and Africa and the impact of discounter store growth in Russia. Additionally, there were declines in forecasted foreign exchange rates in the region. After the impairment, the goodwill carrying amount of the EMEA East reporting unit was approximately $144 million.\nWe recognized a $205 million impairment loss in our Brazil reporting unit within our Rest of World segment. During the first quarter, we observed lower than expected performance in launches of new products coupled with the de-listing of certain existing products as well as higher costs due to changes in our sourcing approach to support revenue growth plans. We developed a new five-year operating plan for the region in the first quarter of 2019, which produced a revised outlook for net sales and margins in contemplation of these events and after considering their potential long-term impacts. Additionally, there were declines in forecasted foreign exchange rates in the region. The impairment of the Brazil reporting unit represents all of the goodwill of that reporting unit.","444":"Our net sales and net income may be exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations.

We have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, these hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency.

We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments.

We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement.

Organic Net Sales decreased 0.1% to $2.8 billion in 2019 compared to $2.8 billion in 2018 primarily due to unfavorable volume\/mix (1.3 pp), partially offset by higher pricing (1.2 pp). Unfavorable volume\/mix was due to ongoing weakness in infant nutrition, partially offset by growth in condiments and sauces. Higher pricing was primarily driven by price increases in Brazil and Mexico.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA decreased 42.8% to $363 million in 2019 compared to $635 million in 2018, including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency (22.6 pp, including 20.8 pp from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar) and costs not expected to repeat, from a combination of higher labor-related expenses from the impact of the Holidays Act in New Zealand, as well as asset- and inventory-related write-offs in Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Excluding these factors, the decrease in Segment Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher supply chain costs and the Heinz India Transaction which closed on January 30, 2019.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNote 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, includes a summary of the significant accounting policies we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

We estimate that 2020 pension plan contributions will be approximately $19 million. Beyond 2020, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans. Our actual contributions and plans may change due to many factors, including changes in tax, employee benefit, or other laws and regulations, tax deductibility, significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates, or other factors. As such, estimated pension plan contributions for 2020 have been excluded from the above table.\nPostretirement benefit plan contributions were $12 million in 2019. We estimate that 2020 postretirement benefit plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Beyond 2020, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.

The timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities. We do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur; therefore, we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table.\nEquity and Dividends","449":"Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. Consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable, increasing our exposure to credit risk. A significant adverse change in the financial and\/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.\nA downgrade in our credit rating could adversely impact interest costs or access to future borrowings.","450":"We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic initiatives.\nWe plan to continue to conduct strategic initiatives in various markets. Consumer demands, behaviors, tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these markets and, as a result, our sales may not be successful or meet expectations, or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated. We may also face difficulties integrating new business operations with our current sourcing, distribution, information technology systems, and other operations. Any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels. We may also face difficulties divesting business operations with minimal impact to the retained businesses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned strategic initiatives, that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations, or that any divestiture will be completed without disruption, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.\nWe are a global company with sales and operations in numerous countries within developed and emerging markets. Approximately 29% of our 2019 net sales were generated outside of the United States. As a result, we are subject to risks inherent in global operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also include:\ncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including anti-bribery laws such as the FCPA;\nchanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations, or tax audit implications;","451":"Accumulated impairment losses to goodwill were $8.2 billion at December 28, 2019.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors.

Our commitment to sustainability and ESG practices remains at the core of our business, and we have established related goals and targets. For example, we have announced our commitment to science-based targets initiative (SBTi) and to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. We are working with the SBTi to formalize our science-based targets as part of our plan to achieve net zero. However, our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders, and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our large, global customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to support our customers in achieving these reductions, customers may seek out competitors who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all parties, including with meeting our own climate-related and other ESG target ambitions, could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nNew government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may result in increased expenditures for environmental controls, new taxes on the products we produce and significantly increase our compliance costs to meet new disclosure requirements, especially if they are inconsistent or fragmented across different jurisdictions.

Given our global footprint, we are exposed to more uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment. The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments. In addition, actions or decisions we have taken or may take, as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. See \"Item 3. - Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Practices - Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to our ESG practices and commitments may impose additional costs on us or expose us to additional risks.","505":"The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred to customers. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company does not have any material contract assets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20, \"Segments\".\nSignificant Judgments\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The Company identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from the supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.\nThe Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates or other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume. The Company accounts for variable consideration using the most likely amount method. The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement and updates its judgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.","506":"Political uncertainty may also contribute to the general economic conditions in one or more markets in which we operate. For example, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union has resulted in uncertainty regarding the long-term nature of the United Kingdoms relationship with the European Union, causing significant volatility in global financial markets and altering the conduct of market participants. Political developments such as this could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers and employees, and adversely impact profitability.\nInternational Operations - Our international operations subject us to various risks that could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe have operations throughout the world, including facilities located in emerging markets. In fiscal year 2020, approximately 74% of our sales revenue came from developed markets and 26% came from emerging markets. We expect to continue to expand our operations in the future, particularly in the emerging markets.\nManagement of global operations is extremely complex, particularly given the often substantial differences in the cultural, political and regulatory environments of the countries in which we operate. In addition, many of the countries in which we operate, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India and other emerging markets, have underdeveloped or developing legal, regulatory or political systems, which are subject to dynamic change and civil unrest.\nThe profitability of our operations may be adversely impacted by, among other things:\nchanges in applicable fiscal or regulatory regimes;\nchanges in, or difficulties in interpreting and complying with, local laws and regulations, including tax, labor, foreign investment and foreign exchange control laws;","507":"To the extent currency devaluation occurs across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which would adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our reported cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations. Our Board of Directors has approved a hedging policy to limit and manage the risk of such foreign exchange fluctuations, however, if our hedges are not effective in mitigating our foreign currency risks, if we are under-hedged, or if a hedge provider defaults on their obligations under hedging arrangements, it could have a material adverse impact on our reported cash flow, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - A significant write-down of goodwill and\/or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position.","508":"During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of $1.25 billion.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had no other receive-variable\/pay-fixed interest rate swaps than those listed above. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no receive-variable\/pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Although the Company is not applying hedge accounting, the Company believes that these economic hedging instruments are effective in protecting the Company against the risks of changes in the variable interest rate on a portion of its forecasted commercial paper issuances.\nAs of March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2022, the total notional amount of the Companys receive-fixed\/pay-variable interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges of certain of the Company's term debt was $650 million.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Company manufactures and sells its products and finances its operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

While we cannot predict with certainty the changes that may impact our competitiveness, the main methods of competition in the general packaging industry include price, innovation, sustainability, service, and quality.\nThe loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may have a significant impact on our operating results. Additionally, our competitors may develop disruptive technologies or other technological innovations that could increase their ability to compete for our current or potential customers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of established or potential competitors will not materially adversely affect our ability to implement our plans and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.","514":"We have also invested in companies which we do not control through our corporate venturing function. Our investment partners or other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies we do not control may not have interests that are aligned with our goals. We have recognized impairment losses in the past in connection with our investments and we may be required to do so again in the future.\nWe also may face challenges in integrating acquisitions with our existing operations. These challenges could include difficulties in integrating or consolidating business processes and systems, as well as challenges in integrating business cultures, which may result in synergies from acquisitions not being fully realized or taking longer to realize than expected or incurring additional costs to do so. Further, in pursuing growth through acquisitions, we face additional risks common with an acquisition strategy, including failure to identify significant contingencies or legal liabilities in the due diligence process, diversion of management's attention from existing business, and interruptions to normal business operations resulting from the process of integrating operations.\nOperational Risks\nGlobal Economic Conditions - Challenging current and future global economic conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and inflation, have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.","515":"Differentiated Solutions\nOur product portfolio is diverse and dynamic due to our constant innovation and close partnerships with our customers. Behind every one of our products stands a unique combination of technical know-how, business experience, and expertise. We work closely with our customers to identify feasible, high-performance, responsible packaging solutions based on their unique needs. Where solutions do not currently exist, we work to innovate new ones. We invest approximately $100 million every year in our industry-leading research and development capabilities, bringing together the best in packaging design, science, manufacturing, and people.\nExpertise across Packaging Materials\nWe believe that we are uniquely positioned to offer a variety of packaging solutions with a wide, differentiated portfolio of products. Our packaging expertise covers all main packaging materials including paper, metal, plastic, recycled, and bio-based materials and the sustainable use of recyclable plastics. Our expertise and track record translate across many innovative solutions that customers can explore with ease and convenience to meet their growing packaging needs, while improving environmental impact.\nBusiness Strategy\nStrategy\nOur business strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders, and the environment.\nFocused portfolio\nOur portfolio of businesses share certain important characteristics:\nA focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,\ngood industry structure,\nattractive relative growth, and\nmultiple paths for us to win through our leadership position, scale, and ability to differentiate our product offering through innovation.","516":"Our growth may not be sustainable and depends on our ability to retain existing sellers, attract new sellers, and increase sales to both new and existing sellers.\nOur total net revenue grew from $850.2 million in 2014 to $1,267.1 million in 2015 and to $1,708.7 million in 2016. We expect our rate of revenue growth will decline, and it may decline more quickly than we expect for a variety of reasons, including the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our sellers and other users of our services have no obligation to continue to use our services, and we cannot assure you that they will. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our sellers, and the difficulty and costs associated with switching to a competitor may not be significant for many of our services. Our sellers payment processing activity with us may decrease for a variety of reasons, including sellers level of satisfaction with our products and services, the effectiveness of our support services, our pricing, the pricing and quality of competing products or services, the effects of global economic conditions, or reductions in our sellers customer spending levels. In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on existing sellers expanding their use of our products and services. If we are unable to encourage sellers to broaden their use of our services, our growth may slow or stop, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. The growth of our business also depends on our ability to attract new sellers, to encourage larger sellers to use our products and services, and to introduce successful new products and services. We have invested in new products and services, including Square Cash, Caviar, Instant Deposit, and Invoices and will continue to invest in new products and services, but if those products and services fail to be successful, our growth may slow or decline.","517":"Results of Operations\nRevenue (in thousands, except for percentages)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\nTransaction-based revenue $ 3,294,978 $ 3,081,074 $ 213,904 7 %\nSubscription and services-based revenue 1,539,403 1,031,456 507,947 49 %\nHardware revenue 91,654 84,505 7,149 8 %\nBitcoin revenue 4,571,543 516,465 4,055,078 785 %\nTotal net revenue $ 9,497,578 $ 4,713,500 $ 4,784,078 101 %\nTotal net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $4.8 billion, or 101%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.

Bitcoin revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the number of active bitcoin customers, as well as growth in customer demand and bitcoin prices. Additionally, Cash App revenue benefited from increased numbers of transacting active Cash App customers and from disbursements of the CARES Act stimulus programs and unemployment benefits, including a portion of customers who direct deposited these payments into their Cash App accounts.

Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock. In the years when the Company reported a net loss, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):","531":"Our business has generated net losses, and we intend to continue to invest substantially in our business.

If the costs associated with acquiring and supporting new or larger sellers materially rise in the future, including the fees we pay to third parties to advertise our products and services, our expenses may rise significantly. In addition, increases in our seller base could cause us to incur increased losses because costs associated with new sellers are generally incurred up front, while revenue is recognized thereafter as sellers utilize our services. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.","532":"Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nShort-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 153,386 $ 782 $ (164) $ 154,004\nCorporate bonds 76,957 256 (14) 77,199\nCommercial paper 4,999 - - 4,999\nMunicipal securities 10,377 57 (3) 10,431\nU.S. government securities 404,194 1,244 (4) 405,434\nForeign government securities 42,988 139 (82) 43,045\nTotal $ 692,901 $ 2,478 $ (267) $ 695,112\nLong-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 168,762 $ 519 $ (3) $ 169,278\nCorporate bonds 174,655 1,401 (42) 176,014\nMunicipal securities 1,045 15 - 1,060\nU.S. government securities 91,642 433 (2) 92,073\nForeign government securities 25,351 184 (10) 25,525\nTotal $ 461,455 $ 2,552 $ (57) $ 463,950\nThe Company's short-term and long-term investments as of December 31, 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized Gains Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value\nShort-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 131,124 $ 409 $ (11) $ 131,522\nCorporate bonds 67,169 580 (28) 67,721\nMunicipal securities 6,667 109 - 6,776\nU.S. government securities 264,069 1,083 (17) 265,135\nForeign government securities 21,270 48 (16) 21,302\nTotal $ 490,299 $ 2,229 $ (72) $ 492,456\nLong-term debt securities:\nU.S. agency securities $ 63,645 $ 612 $ (189) $ 64,068\nCorporate bonds 141,307 1,832 (61) 143,078\nMunicipal securities 9,594 151 (39) 9,706\nU.S. government securities 294,682 1,287 (190) 295,779\nForeign government securities 24,625 86 (39) 24,672\nTotal $ 533,853 $ 3,968 $ (518) $ 537,303\nThe amortized cost of investments classified as cash equivalents approximated the fair value due to the short-term nature of the investments.\nThe Company's gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2020","533":"using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. This share-based compensation expense valuation model requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the variables used in the calculation. These variables include the expected term (weighted average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of the Companys stock, expected risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. The Company uses the simplified calculation of expected term, defined as an average of the vesting term and the contractual term to maturity. Expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of the Company's common stock along with several entities with characteristics similar to those of the Company. In May 2020, the Company began using its own volatility, as the Company uses its own historical stock price information, such that a peer group is no longer considered necessary. The expected risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option. Share-based compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nInterest Income and Expense, net\nInterest income consists interest income from the Company's investment in marketable debt securities and interest expense relates to the Company's long-term debt.

For example, our products such as the Square Reader often require investments with long lead times. An inability to correctly forecast the success of a particular product could harm our business. We must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products could be affected by many factors, including an increase or decrease in demand for our products or for our competitors products, unanticipated changes in general market or economic conditions, and business closures and other actions taken to combat COVID-19.\nIf we underestimate demand for a particular product, our contract manufacturers and suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of that product to meet our requirements, and we may experience a shortage of that product available for sale or distribution. If we overestimate demand for a particular product, we may experience excess inventory levels for that product and the excess inventory may become obsolete or out-of-date. Inventory levels in excess of demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at further discounted prices, which could negatively impact our gross profit and our business.\nEconomic, Financial, and Tax Risks\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.","537":"Provision for Uncollectible Receivables Related to MCAs\nMerchant cash advance receivable, net, represents the aggregate amount of advances to merchants outstanding as of the balance sheet date, net of an allowance for potential uncollectible amounts. The Company estimates the allowance based on an assessment of various factors, including historical experience, merchants current processing volume, and other factors that may affect the merchants ability to generate future receivables. Additions to the allowance are reflected in current operating results, while charges against the allowance are made when charge-offs are recognized. The additions are classified within transaction and advance losses on the consolidated statements of operations. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company had fully transitioned from offering MCAs to loans. Activity subsequent to this transition relates primarily to updates to the Company's provision estimates for historical balances, write-offs or recoveries. The Company is not exposed to losses for the merchant cash advance receivables that are sold to third-party investors in accordance with the Companys arrangements with them.\nCustomer Funds\nCustomer funds held represent cash stored by customers within the Square Cash App that the customers would later use to send money or make payments, or customer cash in transit. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company held these stored balances as short term deposits within a bank account. Customer funds obligation represents the Company's liability to the customers for the customer funds held.\nInventory\nInventory is comprised of contactless and chip readers, chip card readers, Square Stand, and third-party peripherals. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (generally on a first-in, first-out basis) or market. Inventory that is obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions.","538":"Indemnification Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received 20,793 shares of common stock, respectively, that were forfeited back to the Company as indemnification against liabilities related to certain acquired businesses preacquisition matters. The receipt of the forfeited shares was accounted for as equity repurchases. The Company did not receive any shares related to indemnification arrangements in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nConversion of 2022 Notes and Exercise of the 2022 Convertible Note Hedges\nIn connection with the conversion of certain of the 2022 Notes, the Company issued 16.1 million shares of Class A common stock, of which 8.9 million shares were issued in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company also exercised a pro-rata portion of the 2022 convertible note hedges and received 9.4 million shares of Class A common stock from the counterparties to offset the shares issued, of which 2.2 million shares were received in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock Plans\nThe Company maintains two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2009 Stock Plan (2009 Plan) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan).

We expect competition to intensify in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new services or enhance existing services. For example, companies not traditionally associated with the payments industry have introduced products or services that are or may become competitive with our business. We compete against many companies to attract customers both within our seller ecosystem and our Cash App ecosystem, and some of these companies have greater financial resources and substantially larger bases of customers than we do, which may provide them with significant competitive advantages. These companies may devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of products and services, may achieve economies of scale due to the size of their customer bases, and may more effectively introduce their own innovative products and services that adversely impact our growth. Mergers and acquisitions by these companies may lead to even larger competitors with more resources.\nCertain sellers have long-standing exclusive, or nearly exclusive, relationships with our competitors to accept payment cards and other services that compete with what we offer. These relationships may make it difficult or cost-prohibitive for us to conduct material amounts of business with them. Competing services tied to established brands may engender greater confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services. If we are unable to differentiate ourselves from and successfully compete with our competitors, our business will be materially and adversely affected.","540":"We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and evolve. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in e-commerce, mobile commerce, and proximity payment devices (including contactless payments via NFC technology). Other potential changes are on the horizon as well, such as developments in crypto-currencies and in tokenization, which replaces sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with symbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that it ends up in the wrong hands. Similarly, there is rapid innovation in the provision of other products and services to businesses, including in financial services and marketing services.","541":"10.\nSquare transfers the funds to the sellers bank account, net of the fee charged by Square. Square provides sellers with fast access to funds, typically settling with them by the business day after the date of the transaction via Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, or the same day via its Instant Deposit service for an additional transaction fee. Square pays a very small fee for each ACH transfer.\n11.\nThe funds are settled from the Acquiring Bank to Square, typically in one to two business days after the date of the transaction.\n12.\nAt the end of the month, the Issuing Bank sends a statement to the buyer showing their monthly charges. The statement includes a reference to Square as the merchant of record on the billing statement as a prefix to the seller name (denoted as SQ).\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are competitive and evolving. Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our commerce ecosystem and our focus on building products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable. With respect to each of these factors, we believe that we compare favorably to our competitors.\nFor payments and point-of-sale services, we compete primarily with traditional acquiring processors and payment processors who sell costly card terminal and point-of-sale systems, often tied to long-term contracts, through direct sales or Independent Sales Organization (ISO) channels. Many competitors offer payments and point-of-sale services that have features tailored to particular industries or business types but require sellers to stitch together technology from multiple hardware, software, and payments vendors.\nSome sellers may elect to use individual point-of-sale solutions from other companies that overlap with certain functions and features that we provide, including:","542":"Product Development and Technology\nWe design both our Seller and Cash App products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant, and we organize our product teams accordingly, combining individuals from product management, engineering, data science, analytics, design, and product marketing. Our products and services are platform-agnostic with most supporting iOS, Android, and web. We frequently update our software products and have a rapid software release schedule with improvements deployed regularly. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services.\nIn our Seller ecosystem, this enables us to capture and analyze billions of transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95% of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production.\nOur Competition\nSeller Ecosystem\nThe markets in which our seller ecosystem operates are competitive and evolving. Our competitors range from large, well-established vendors to smaller, earlier-stage companies.\nWe seek to differentiate ourselves from competitors primarily on the basis of our extensive commerce ecosystem and our focus on building remarkable products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and elegant. In addition, we differentiate ourselves by offering transparent pricing, no long-term contracts, and our ability to innovate and reshape the industries we operate in to expand access to traditionally unserved or underserved sellers.

For example, we tested controls over managements review of the methodology to determine estimated losses, the completeness and accuracy of underlying loss rate data used in the estimation of potential losses from chargebacks, the assumptions made about future chargebacks, and the appropriateness of the qualitative adjustments to the reserve methodology. This included the controls over identification and assessment of the qualitative adjustments, the completeness and accuracy of data used to estimate the qualitative aspects of the reserve, managements evaluation of new or contradictory information, and managements review and approval of the adjustments.\nTo test the Companys reserve for transaction losses, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Companys methodology and testing the underlying data and assumptions used by management to estimate potential losses. We compared the Companys historical estimated potential losses with actual results to assess the Companys methodology to estimate potential losses. We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the loss rate data used in the calculation of the Companys reserve for transaction losses by agreeing such data to third-party data. In addition, we evaluated adjustments made by management to the Companys methodology to estimate potential losses, to reflect expectations of future chargebacks and uncertainty in the current economic environment, including the basis for concluding whether such adjustments were warranted and whether new or contradictory information existed. We also reviewed subsequent events, which included actual chargebacks, and considered whether they corroborated the Companys conclusion.\nConvertible Senior Notes","548":"Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.

Subscription and services-based revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue. Hardware revenue generally demonstrates less seasonality than transaction-based revenue, with most fluctuations tied to periodic product launches, promotions, or other arrangements with our retail partners. We have not historically experienced meaningful seasonality with respect to total net revenue as this effect has been offset by our revenue growth. In 2020, typical historical seasonality trends for the Seller ecosystem were impacted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions.","553":"NOTE 14 - INCOME TAXES\nThe domestic and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDomestic $ 369,016 $ 456,335 $ 44,538\nForeign (153,049) (78,122) (80,665)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes $ 215,967 $ 378,213 $ (36,127)\nThe components of the provision for income taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ 114 $ (4)\nState 4,016 930 752\nForeign 6,862 3,099 2,224\nTotal current provision for income taxes 10,878 4,143 2,972\nDeferred:\nFederal (970) (777) (404)\nState (231) (399) 35\nForeign (6,815) (200) (277)\nTotal deferred provision for income taxes (8,016) (1,376) (646)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 2,862 $ 2,767 $ 2,326\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate:\nBalance at December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nTax at federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 0.3 0.1 (1.1)\nForeign rate differential 4.0 1.4 (14.7)\nNon-deductible meals 0.3 0.3 (3.4)\nOther non-deductible expenses 2.4 0.2 (0.9)\nCredits (34.6) (13.9) 164.8\nOther items 2.2 (0.5) 2.3\nChange in valuation allowance 153.9 34.9 (718.5)\nShare-based compensation (155.4) (45.8) 549.0\nChange in uncertain tax positions 2.3 0.5 (4.1)\nSale of Caviar business line - 1.2 -\nNon-deductible executive compensation 3.6 0.6 -\nNon-deductible acquisition-related costs 1.3 0.7 (0.8)\nTotal 1.3 % 0.7 % (6.4) %\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and related deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at December 31,\n2020 2019\nDeferred tax assets:\nCapitalized costs $ 17,994 $ 23,708\nAccrued expenses 47,653 33,044\nNet operating loss carryforwards 962,069 575,245\nTax credit carryforwards 254,789 183,977\nShare-based compensation 40,784 38,427\nDeferred Interest 13,800 4,072\nOther - 3,424\nOperating Lease, net - 5,761\nTotal deferred tax assets 1,337,089 867,658","554":"Year Ended December 31,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n$\n1,662\n$\n2,746\nState\nForeign\n1,269\n1,222\nTotal current provision for income taxes\n1,859\n3,720\n4,104\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(2,503\n)\nState\n(161\n)\nForeign\n(133\n)\n(52\n)\n-\nTotal deferred provision for income taxes\n(2,664\n)\nTotal provision for income taxes\n$\n1,917\n$\n3,746\n$\n1,440\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate:\nBalance at December 31,\nTax at federal statutory rate\n34.0\n%\n34.0\n%\n34.0\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n(0.1\n)\n(0.2\n)\n(0.1\n)\nForeign rate differential\n(2.4\n)\n(1.8\n)\n(1.5\n)\nNondeductible expenses\n(3.3\n)\n(3.3\n)\n(1.8\n)\nCredits\n8.5\n8.2\n2.7\nOther items\n(0.4\n)\n(0.4\n)\n0.7\nChange in valuation allowance\n(37.4\n)\n(38.6\n)\n(35.0\n)\nTotal\n(1.1\n)%\n(2.1\n)%\n(1.0\n)%\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and related deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nBalance at December 31,\nDeferred tax assets:\nCapitalized costs\n$\n61,897\n$\n67,051\n$\n28,102\nAccrued expenses\n29,421\n27,964\n19,714\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n65,507\n36,633\n54,528\nTax credit carryforwards\n38,927\n25,349\n11,662\nProperty, equipment and intangible assets\n5,721\n-\n-\nShare-based compensation\n52,091\n36,689\n13,153\nOther\n1,640\n1,469\nTotal deferred tax assets\n255,204\n195,155\n127,701\nValuation allowance\n(254,898\n)\n(195,103\n)\n(125,368\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n2,333\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, equipment and intangible assets\n(476\n)\n(163\n)\n(2,333\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(476\n)\n(163\n)\n(2,333\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(170\n)\n$\n(111\n)\n$\n-","555":"5,190\n-\n26,690\nGross increases and decreases related to current period tax positions\n(3,428\n)\n12,341\n37,189\nBalance at the end of the year\n$\n92,134\n$\n90,372\n$\n78,031\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.

It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be repatriated.\nNOTE 14 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nInitial Public Offering\nIn November 2015, the Company completed its IPO in which it issued and sold 29,700,000 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price of $9.00 per share. The total net proceeds received from the IPO were $245.7 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $14.7 million and other offering expenses of approximately $6.9 million.\nConvertible Preferred Stock","556":"Our efforts to expand our product portfolio and market reach may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.\nWhile we have grown the proportion of revenue from newer products and services from each of the Cash App and Seller segments and we intend to continue to broaden the scope of products and services we offer, we may not be successful in maintaining or growing our current revenue streams, or deriving any significant new revenue streams from these products and services. Failure to successfully broaden the scope of products and services that are attractive may inhibit our growth and harm our business. Furthermore, we expect to continue to expand our markets in the future, and we may have limited or no experience in such newer markets. We cannot assure you that any of our products or services will be widely accepted in any market or that they will continue to grow in revenue. Our offerings may present new and difficult technological, operational, regulatory, risks, and other challenges, and if we experience service disruptions, failures, or other issues, our business may be materially and adversely affected. For example, our Cash App products are intended to make investing in certain assets, such as bitcoin, stocks, and exchange-traded funds, more accessible. However, as a result, our customers who use these products may experience losses or other financial impacts due to, among other things, market fluctuations in the prices of bitcoin and stocks. If our users are adversely affected by such risks, they may cease using the product or Cash App altogether and our business, brand, and reputation may be adversely affected. Further, our newer activities may not lead to growth or recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all and may require significant management time and attention. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and materially and adversely affect our business.","557":"Product Development and Technology\nWe design our products and services to be cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable, and we organize our product teams accordingly, combining individuals from product management, development and engineering, data science, and design. Our products and services are mobile-first and platform-agnostic, and we are able to continuously optimize them because our hardware, software, and payments processing are integrated. We frequently update our software products and have a regular software release schedule with improvements deployed generally twice a month, ensuring our sellers get immediate access to the latest features. Our services are built on a scalable technology platform, and we place a strong emphasis on data analytics and machine learning to maximize the efficacy, efficiency, and scalability of our services. This enables us to capture and analyze over a billion transactions per year and automate risk assessment for more than 99.95% of all transactions. Our hardware is designed and developed in-house, and we contract with third-party manufacturers for production. Our product development expenses were $268.5 million, $199.6 million and $144.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nTransaction Processing Overview\nProcessing card transactions requires close coordination among a number of industry participants that provide the services and infrastructure required to enable such transactions. These participants consist of payment service providers, acquiring processors, card networks, and issuing banks. Within this landscape, Square serves as a payment service provider, acting as the touch point for the seller to the rest of the payment chain. The definitions and graphic below outline this payment chain and the typical flow of a Square transaction, along with the types of fees typically paid and received at each stage.","558":"Product development. Product development expenses currently represent the largest component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of expenses related to our engineering, data science, and design personnel; fees and supply costs related to maintenance and capacity expansion at third-party data center facilities; hardware related development and tooling costs; and fees for software licenses, consulting, legal, and other services that are directly related to growing and maintaining our portfolio of products and services. Additionally, product development expenses include the depreciation of product-related infrastructure and tools, including data center equipment, internally developed software, and computer equipment. We continue to focus our product development efforts on adding new features and apps, and on enhancing the functionality and ease of use\nof our offerings. Our ability to realize returns on these investments is substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully address current and emerging requirements of sellers and buyers through the development and introduction of these new products and services. While we expect total product development expenses to increase as we invest further in engineering and design personnel, over time we also expect our product development expenses to decline as a percentage of total net revenue.","559":"If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities, or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nAny acquisitions, strategic investments, entries into new businesses, divestitures, and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing operations, and harm our business.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions and evaluate opportunities for possible acquisitions, strategic investments, entries into new businesses, divestitures, and other transactions. We continue to seek to acquire or invest in businesses, apps, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products and services, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The identification, evaluation, and negotiation of potential acquisitions or divestitures may divert the attention of management and entail various expenses, whether or not such transactions are ultimately completed. We also have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. In addition to opportunity costs, these transactions involve large challenges and risks, whether or not such transactions are completed, including risks that:\nthe transaction may not advance our business strategy;\nwe may be unable to identify opportunities on terms acceptable to us;\nwe may not realize a satisfactory return or increase our revenue;\nwe may experience disruptions on our ongoing operations and divert managements attention;","560":"We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and evolve. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in e-commerce, mobile commerce, and proximity payment devices (including contactless payments via NFC technology). Other potential changes are on the horizon as well, such as developments in crypto-currencies and in tokenization, which replaces sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with symbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that it ends up in the wrong hands. Similarly, there is rapid innovation in the provision of other products and services to businesses, including in financial services and marketing services.","561":"The total fair value of shares vested in the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $817.5 million, $552.9 million, and $489.3 million, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn November 17, 2015, the Companys 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) became effective. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a discount through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, (or 25% for offering periods that commence after November 1, 2019), subject to any plan limitations. The ESPP provides for 12-month offering periods. The offering periods are scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after May 15 and November 15 of each year. Each offering period includes two purchase periods, which begin on the first trading day on or after November 15 and May 15, and ending on the last trading day on or before May 15 and November 15, respectively. Employees are able to purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or the last trading day of the purchase period. The number of shares available for sale under the ESPP will be increased annually on the first day of each fiscal year, equal to the least of (i) 8,400,000 shares, (ii) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such other amount as determined by the administrator. As of December 31, 2020, 5,829,106 shares had been purchased under the ESPP and 17,816,248 shares were available for future issuance under the ESPP.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of stock options granted was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDividend yield - % - % - %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.41 % 2.37 % 2.92 %\nExpected volatility 48.29 % 40.48 % 30.87 %\nExpected term (years) 6.02 6.02 6.19","562":"Year Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nDividend yield - % - % - %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.41 % 2.37 % 2.92 %\nExpected volatility 48.29 % 40.48 % 30.87 %\nExpected term (years) 6.02 6.02 6.19\nThe following table summarizes the effects of share-based compensation on the Company's consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nCost of revenue $ 368 $ 155 $ 97\nProduct development 289,553 210,840 144,601\nSales and marketing 36,627 26,720 22,797\nGeneral and administrative 70,952 60,148 49,386\nTotal $ 397,500 $ 297,863 $ 216,881\nThe Company recorded $18.2 million, $18.9 million, and $9.0 million of share-based compensation expense related to the Company's 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe Company capitalized $13.9 million, $8.2 million, and $9.3 million of share-based compensation expense related to capitalized software during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $1.1 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.85 years.\nNOTE 16 - NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding adjusted for the dilutive effect of all potential shares of common stock. In the years when the Company reported a net loss, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in thousands, except per share data):","563":"Indemnification Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received 20,793 shares of common stock, respectively, that were forfeited back to the Company as indemnification against liabilities related to certain acquired businesses preacquisition matters. The receipt of the forfeited shares was accounted for as equity repurchases. The Company did not receive any shares related to indemnification arrangements in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nConversion of 2022 Notes and Exercise of the 2022 Convertible Note Hedges\nIn connection with the conversion of certain of the 2022 Notes, the Company issued 16.1 million shares of Class A common stock, of which 8.9 million shares were issued in the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company also exercised a pro-rata portion of the 2022 convertible note hedges and received 9.4 million shares of Class A common stock from the counterparties to offset the shares issued, of which 2.2 million shares were received in the year ended December 31, 2020.\nStock Plans\nThe Company maintains two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2009 Stock Plan (2009 Plan) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan). The 2015 Plan serves as the successor to the 2009 Plan. The 2015 Plan became effective as of November 17, 2015. Outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2009 Plan. Since November 17, 2015, no additional awards have been nor will be granted in the future under the 2009 Plan.","564":"acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt.\nWe may also choose to divest certain businesses or product lines. If we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty obtaining terms acceptable to us in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, we may experience difficulty separating out portions of, or entire, businesses, incur potential loss of revenue or experience negative impact on margins, or we may not achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. For example, in 2019, we completed the sale of Caviar to DoorDash in exchange for cash and stock consideration. Following DoorDashs initial public offering, we are required to mark to market our equity holdings each quarter, which may result in fluctuations of our results of operations due to the trading price of DoorDashs Class A common stock. Further, because we are subject to a lock-up agreement with respect to such holdings, we are restricted from selling all of our equity holdings for a period of 180 days following DoorDash's IPO, and there can be no assurances that we will fully realize the value of the stock consideration once we are able to sell. Such potential transactions may also delay achievement of our strategic objectives, cause us to incur additional expenses, potentially disrupt customer or employee relationships, and expose us to unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as a result of our indemnification obligations. Further, during the pendency of a divestiture, we may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business, loss of employees, customers, or suppliers and the risk that the transaction may not close, any of which would have a material adverse effect on the business to be divested and the Company. If a divestiture is not completed for any reason, we may not be able to find another buyer on the same terms, and we may have incurred significant costs without the corresponding benefit.","565":"Square Capital facilitates loans to qualified Square sellers through a partnership with an industrial bank. Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process. We are able to approve sellers for these loans while facilitating prudent risk management by using our unique data set of a sellers Square transactions to help facilitate loan underwriting and collections. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loan in less than nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated more than 1.2 million loans and advances, representing more than $8.1 billion. This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts). The Square ecosystem drives competitive differentiation for our Payroll product with the ability to use Payroll in conjunction with our point of sale products, Team Management, and Cash App.","566":"As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,456,955 shares of its capital stock, with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $11.01 per share.\nStock Plans\nThe Company maintains two share-based employee compensation plans: the 2009 Stock Option Plan (2009 Plan) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan). The 2015 Plan serves as the successor to its 2009 Plan. The 2015 Plan became effective as of November 17, 2015. Outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2009 Plan.\nUnder the 2015 Plan, shares of common stock are reserved for the issuance of incentive stock options (ISOs), non-statutory stock options (NSOs), restricted stock awards, RSUs, performance shares and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. The shares may be granted at a price per share not less than the fair market value at the date of grant. Initially, 30,000,000 shares were reserved under the 2015 Plan and any shares subject to options or other similar awards granted under the 2009 Plan that expire, are forfeited, are repurchased by the Company or otherwise terminate unexercised will become available under the 2015 Plan. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year, in an amount equal to the least of (i) 40,000,000 shares, (ii) 5% of the outstanding shares on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) such number of shares determined by the Companys board of directors. As of December 31, 2016, the total number of options and RSUs outstanding under the 2015 Plan was 19,295,512 million shares, and 36,282,753 million shares were available for future issuance.","567":"Historically, our Cash App ecosystem experiences improvements in revenue and gross profit related to the distribution of government funds as customers have pulled more funds into Cash App, including during the first quarter related to the distribution of tax refunds. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we saw a significant increase in total Cash App revenue, primarily from bitcoin revenue which contributed 48% of total consolidated net revenue in 2020, and 85% of the total increase in consolidated net revenues in 2020. The primary drivers of bitcoin revenue are customer demand and the current market price of bitcoin, and as such, may not be indicative of future performance and skew typical seasonality trends in the Cash App ecosystem.\nCorporate Information\nSquare was incorporated in Delaware in June 2009.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe have operations both within the United States and globally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA","577":"We expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge and evolve. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in e-commerce, mobile commerce, and proximity payment devices (including contactless payments via NFC technology). Other potential changes are on the horizon as well, such as developments in crypto-currencies and in tokenization, which replaces sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) with symbols (tokens) to keep the data safe in the event that it ends up in the wrong hands. Similarly, there is rapid innovation in the provision of other products and services to businesses, including in financial services and marketing services.","578":"If we do not continue to improve our operational, financial, and other internal controls and systems to manage growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur current business and anticipated growth, as well as our entry into new lines of business, will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources. In order to manage our growth effectively, we must continue to strengthen our existing infrastructure and operational procedures, enhance our internal controls and reporting systems, and ensure we timely and accurately address issues as they arise. In particular, our continued growth will increase the challenges involved in:\nimproving existing and developing new internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our operational, financial, communications, and other internal systems and procedures;\ninstalling enhanced management information and control systems; and\npreserving our core values, strategies, and goals and effectively communicating these to our employees worldwide.\nIf we are not successful in developing and implementing the right processes and tools to manage our enterprise, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired.\nThese efforts may require substantial financial expenditures, commitments of resources, developments of our processes, and other investments and innovations. As we grow, we must balance the need for additional controls and systems with the ability to efficiently develop and launch new features for our products and services. However, it is likely that as we grow, we will not be able to launch new features, or respond to customer or market demands as quickly as a smaller, more efficient organization. If we do not successfully manage our growth, our business will suffer.","579":"Our efforts to expand our product portfolio and market reach may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth.\nWhile we have grown the proportion of revenue from newer products and services from each of the Cash App and Seller segments and we intend to continue to broaden the scope of products and services we offer, we may not be successful in maintaining or growing our current revenue streams, or deriving any significant new revenue streams from these products and services. Failure to successfully broaden the scope of products and services that are attractive may inhibit our growth and harm our business. Furthermore, we expect to continue to expand our markets in the future, and we may have limited or no experience in such newer markets. We cannot assure you that any of our products or services will be widely accepted in any market or that they will continue to grow in revenue. Our offerings may present new and difficult technological, operational, regulatory, risks, and other challenges, and if we experience service disruptions, failures, or other issues, our business may be materially and adversely affected. For example, our Cash App products are intended to make investing in certain assets, such as bitcoin, stocks, and exchange-traded funds, more accessible. However, as a result, our customers who use these products may experience losses or other financial impacts due to, among other things, market fluctuations in the prices of bitcoin and stocks. If our users are adversely affected by such risks, they may cease using the product or Cash App altogether and our business, brand, and reputation may be adversely affected. Further, our newer activities may not lead to growth or recoup our investments in a timely manner or at all and may require significant management time and attention. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and materially and adversely affect our business.","580":"Note 2. Revenue\nThe Company adopted ASU No. 2014-09 and related standards (collectively, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers), on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative net impact of adopting ASC 606, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily\n\t\t\nrelating to the accelerated recognition for software installation service and training revenue. This cumulative impact reflects retrospective application of ASC 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Further, the Company applied the practical expedient permitting the effect of all contract modifications that occurred before January 1, 2018 to be aggregated in the transition accounting. The impact of applying ASC 606 as compared with previous guidance applied to revenues and costs was not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nContract Balances:\nDeferred revenue (current portion) as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $617 million and $513 million, respectively, and primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts, the changes in balance of which are related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of these contracts. The balance also contains a deferral for goods that are in-transit at period end for which control transfers to the customer upon delivery. Approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2017 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The amount of noncurrent deferred revenue is not significant.\nDisaggregated revenue information:\nThe Company views the following disaggregated disclosures as useful to understanding the composition of revenue recognized during the respective reporting periods:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nNet Sales (Millions)\nAbrasives\n$\n1,804\n$\n1,746\n$\n1,626\nAdhesives and Tapes\n4,607\n4,468\n4,239\nAdvanced Materials","581":"In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606, which clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. The ASU precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue from contracts with customers if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. Further, the ASU amends ASC 808 to refer to the unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 and requires it to be used only when assessing whether a transaction is in the scope of ASC 606. For 3M, the ASU is effective as of January 1, 2020. 3M has limited collaborative arrangements. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments, which clarifies that receivables arising from operating leases are not within the scope of the credit losses standard, but rather, should be accounted for in accordance with the lease standard. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-13, which for 3M is January 1, 2020. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, which amends ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. The new ASU provides narrow-scope amendments to help lessors apply the new leases standard. This ASU has the same transition requirements and effective date as ASU No. 2016-02, which for 3M is January 1, 2019. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nNote 2. Revenue","582":"3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2019. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2019. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2019 (before settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) to decrease by approximately $130 million pre-tax when compared to 2018.

This increase was partially offset by 2017 portfolio and supply chain footprint optimization charges that did not repeat in 2018, and selling price increases.

These were partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense and defined contribution expense.\nCost of sales as a percent of sales increased during 2017 due to incremental strategic investments in productivity, portfolio actions and footprint optimization, foreign currency effects (net of hedge impacts) and higher defined benefit pension expense.

See additional information in Note 14.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker-impacting 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit\/loss (business segment operating income (loss)). Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer business segment re-aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 15. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of these changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share","592":"Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is a result of the dilution associated with the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans were not included in the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect of 36.9 million and 36.5 million average options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and 31.9 million and 27.5 million average options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. In periods of net losses, these antidilutive effects include all weighted option shares outstanding and weighted average shares is the same for the calculations of both basic and diluted loss per share.

Current portion of long-term debt increased as upcoming debt maturities now considered current were partially offset by the bond maturities in 2022, while accounts payable also increased as a result of increased sequential operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\nCash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows.

This followed a decrease of $422 million when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, which replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February 2019, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poors and an A1 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moodys Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital markets funding throughout business cycles.\nRaw materials:","595":"Cash Flows from Investing Activities:\nYears ended December 31\n(Millions)\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\n$\n(1,577)\n$\n(1,373)\n$\n(1,420)\nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(2,023)\n(16)\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net\n(798)\n(163)\nProceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold\n1,065\nOther - net\n(6)\n(4)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n$\n$\n(3,086)\n$\n(1,403)\n\t\t\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2019 capital spending to be approximately $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion as 3M continues to invest in its businesses.\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT) and laboratory facilities.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures. The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses. Proceeds from sale of businesses in 2018 primarily relate to the sale of 3Ms Communication Markets Division and the sale of certain personal safety product offerings primarily focused on noise, environmental, and heat stress monitoring within the Safety and Graphics business segment.","596":"Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Companys commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices - such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers - at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Companys emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n\t\t\nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nExecutive Officers","597":"NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\t\t\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nThe strength and stability of 3Ms business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, positions the Company to be able to add further leverage to its capital structure. Investing in 3Ms businesses to drive organic growth remains the first priority for capital deployment, including research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. Investment in organic growth will be supplemented by complementary acquisitions. 3M will also continue to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Sources for cash availability in the United States, such as ongoing cash flow from operations and access to capital markets, have historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders, as well as funding U.S. acquisitions and other items as needed. The TCJA creates additional repatriation opportunities for 3M to access international cash positions on a continual and on-going basis and will help support U.S. capital deployments needs. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3Ms primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, there was approximately $435 million in commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nTotal Debt:","598":"Total Debt:\nThe strength of 3Ms capital structure and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Companys maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors and has an A1 credit rating with a stable outlook from Moodys Investors Service.\nThe Companys total debt was $0.7 billion higher at December 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017. Increases in debt related to September 2018 debt issuances of $2.25 billion along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings of international subsidiaries along with foreign currency effects. These were partially offset by August 2018 and November 2018 maturation of $450 million and 500 million Euro, respectively, aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes in addition to commercial paper of $435 million outstanding at year end 2018 compared to $745 million outstanding at year end 2017. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\nEffective February 24, 2017, the Company updated its well-known seasoned issuer (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3Ms previous shelf registration dated May 16, 2014. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Companys medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series.","599":"Credit Facilities\nIn March 2016, 3M amended and restated its existing $2.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in August 2019 to a $3.75 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in March 2021. This credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.25 billion (at lenders discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.0 billion. This revolving credit facility was undrawn at December 31, 2018. Under the $3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nOther Credit Facilities\nApart from the committed revolving facility, an additional $243 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\nLong-Term Debt Issuances\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.","600":"Credit Facilities\n3M has an amended and restated $3.0 billion five year revolving credit facility expiring in November 2024. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lenders discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration date of November 2023. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2022. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2022, this ratio was approximately 19 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nIn December 2021 and June 2022, 3M entered into debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.","601":"* The Companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. This ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n* The Companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. It is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. Any sustained interruption in the Companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, while the Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.","602":"Unconditional purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company. Included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. These estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. Many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. The Company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. Contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the Company is contractually obligated. The majority of 3Ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the Companys expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.","603":"Accounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $323 million, $327 million and $278 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.","604":"These non-GAAP measures are further described and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the section that follows.\nAdditional discussion related to the components of the year-on-year change in earnings per diluted share follows:\n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\n\u00b7\nIn May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain of $457 million, which was reported within the Companys Safety and Graphics business.

The Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the Companys ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.\n* The Companys future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated. The Company utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation. Business transformation is defined as changes in processes and internal\/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis. There can be no assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.","613":"Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Operating income, segment operating income (loss), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. While the Company includes certain items in its measure of segment operating performance, it also considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing its operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is useful to investors in understanding underlying business performance, while also providing additional transparency to the special items. Special items impacting operating income are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.","614":"Legal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide.

Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. The Company generally responds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil, or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict.

However, even when a loss or range of loss is not probable and reasonably estimable, developments in, or the ultimate resolution of, a matter could be material to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\nRaw materials:","638":"Employment decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021.

Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nThe Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors.\nLegal Proceedings:","639":"3M Company and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nPART II\nItem 7\nRevenue Recognition","663":"FINANCIAL CONDITION\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $113.2 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $96.5 billion as of June 30, 2015. Equity and other investments were $10.4 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared with $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2015. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities in order to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.","664":"(10\n)\n(81\n)\n(2\n)\nTotal\n$\n(98\n)\n$\n(57\n)\n$\nNet recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nNet realized gains on investments sold\n$\n$\n$\nNet unrealized gains on investments still held\n1,057\nImpairments of investments\n(20\n)\n(20\n)\n(11\n)\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n1,169\nPART II\nItem 8\nNOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS\nInvestment Components\nThe components of investments were as follows:\n(In millions)\nFair Value\nLevel\nAdjusted\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nRecorded\nBasis\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nEquity\nInvestments\nJune 30, 2023\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income\nCommercial paper\nLevel 2\n$\n16,589\n$\n$\n$\n16,589\n$\n12,231\n$\n4,358\n$\nCertificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n2,701\n2,701\n2,657\nU.S. government securities\nLevel 1\n65,237\n(3,870\n)\n61,369\n2,991\n58,378\nU.S. agency securities\nLevel 2\n2,703\n2,703\n1,809\nForeign government bonds\nLevel 2\n(24\n)\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities\nLevel 2\n(39\n)\nCorporate notes and bonds\nLevel 2\n10,809\n(583\n)\n10,234\n10,234\nCorporate notes and bonds\nLevel 3\nMunicipal securities\nLevel 2\n(18\n)\nMunicipal securities\nLevel 3\n(16\n)\nTotal debt investments\n$\n99,869\n$\n$\n(4,550\n)\n$\n95,332\n$\n18,780\n$\n76,552\n$\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income\nEquity investments\nLevel 1\n$\n10,138\n$\n7,446\n$\n$\n2,692\nEquity investments\nOther\n7,187\n7,187\nTotal equity investments\n$\n17,325\n$\n7,446\n$\n$\n9,879\nCash\n$\n8,478\n$\n8,478\n$\n$\nDerivatives, net (a)\nTotal\n$\n121,141\n$\n34,704\n$\n76,558\n$\n9,879\nPART II\nItem 8\n(In millions)\nFair Value\nLevel\nAdjusted\nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nRecorded\nBasis\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nShort-term\nInvestments\nEquity\nInvestments\nJune 30, 2022\nChanges in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income\nCommercial paper\nLevel 2\n$\n2,500\n$\n$\n$\n2,500\n$\n2,498\n$\n$\nCertificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n2,071\n2,071\n2,032\nU.S. government securities\nLevel 1\n79,696\n(2,178\n)\n77,547\n77,538\nU.S. agency securities\nLevel 2\n(9\n)\nForeign government bonds\nLevel 2","665":"Dividends\nSee Note 18 - Stockholders Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters.

We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn, and we expect the acquisition will close in calendar year 2016, subject to approval by LinkedIns shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.\nIn May 2016, we announced the sale of our entry-level feature phone business for $350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.\nIn July 2015, we announced a plan to restructure our phone business to better focus and align resources. In May 2016, we announced plans to further streamline our smartphone hardware business. These changes in the phone business reinforce our strategy to create a vibrant Windows ecosystem with a single set of experiences across our first-party device family and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offerings. Part of this strategy involves focusing our phone devices on a narrower range of customer categories and differentiating through the combination of hardware and software we are uniquely positioned to offer. As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.\nIndustry Trends","667":"Industry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\nThe market for software, devices, and cloud-based services is dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the users choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in devices and infrastructure will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. Microsoft competes for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow ones career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\nPART II\nItem 7","668":"Income Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nPART II\nItem 7","669":"There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS\nGovernment litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.\nPART I\nItem 1A","670":"In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.","671":"Total stockholders equity\n71,997\n80,083\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity\n$ 193,694\n$ 174,472\nSee accompanying notes.\nPART II\nItem 8\nCASH FLOWS STATEMENTS\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nOperations\nNet income\n$ 16,798\n$ 12,193\n$ 22,074\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash from operations:\nGoodwill and asset impairments\n7,498\nDepreciation, amortization, and other\n6,622\n5,957\n5,212\nStock-based compensation expense\n2,668\n2,574\n2,446\nNet recognized gains on investments and derivatives\n(223 )\n(443 )\n(109 )\nDeferred income taxes\n(331 )\nDeferral of unearned revenue\n57,072\n45,072\n44,325\nRecognition of unearned revenue\n(48,498 )\n(44,920 )\n(41,739 )\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable\n(530 )\n1,456\n(1,120 )\nInventories\n(272 )\n(161 )\nOther current assets\n(1,167 )\n(29 )\nOther long-term assets\n(41 )\n(628 )\nAccounts payable\n(1,054 )\nOther current liabilities\n(260 )\n(624 )\n1,075\nOther long-term liabilities\n(766 )\n1,599\n1,014\nNet cash from operations\n33,325\n29,668\n32,502\nFinancing\nProceeds from issuance of short-term debt, maturities of 90 days or less, net\n7,195\n4,481\nProceeds from issuance of debt\n13,884\n10,680\n10,350\nRepayments of debt\n(2,796 )\n(1,500 )\n(3,888 )\nCommon stock issued\nCommon stock repurchased\n(15,969 )\n(14,443 )\n(7,316 )\nCommon stock cash dividends paid\n(11,006 )\n(9,882 )\n(8,879 )\nOther\n(369 )\n(39 )\nNet cash used in financing\n(8,393 )\n(9,668 )\n(8,665 )\nInvesting\nAdditions to property and equipment\n(8,343 )\n(5,944 )\n(5,485 )\nAcquisition of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets\n(1,393 )\n(3,723 )\n(5,937 )\nPurchases of investments\n(129,758 )\n(98,729 )\n(72,690 )\nMaturities of investments\n22,054\n15,013\n5,272\nSales of investments\n93,287\n70,848\n60,094\nSecurities lending payable\n(466 )\n(87 )\nNet cash used in investing\n(23,950 )\n(23,001 )\n(18,833 )\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(67 )\n(73 )\n(139 )\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(3,074 )\n4,865","672":"In June 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LinkedIn for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIns net cash (the Merger Agreement).

In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.

We have been added to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U.S. and one active case in U.S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in an inter partes review the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the Delaware case. IDT has appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Delaware case has been stayed pending final completion of the inter partes review (including appeals and any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging the unlawful exploitation of standard essential patents. IDT filed a motion to dismiss, which the District Court denied.\nEuropean copyright levies","682":"PART I\nItem 1A\nHow these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.

Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.

Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.\nGENERAL RISKS\nIf our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:\nThe introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.\nPublic scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.\nData security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.","685":"Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022\nInterest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments.\nINCOME TAXES\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.","686":"$\n(6,059\n)\n$\n(5,702\n)\n$\n(150\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n16,950\n$\n10,978\n$\n9,831\nPART II\nItem 8\nU.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:\n(In millions)\nYear Ended June 30,\nU.S.\n$\n52,917\n$\n47,837\n$\n34,972\nForeign\n36,394\n35,879\n36,130\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n89,311\n$\n83,716\n$\n71,102\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\nFederal statutory rate\n21.0%\n21.0%\n21.0%\nEffect of:\nForeign earnings taxed at lower rates\n(1.8)%\n(1.3)%\n(2.7)%\nImpact of intangible property transfers\n0%\n(3.9)%\n0%\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction\n(1.3)%\n(1.1)%\n(1.3)%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.6%\n1.4%\n1.4%\nResearch and development credit\n(1.1)%\n(0.9)%\n(0.9)%\nExcess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation\n(0.7)%\n(1.9)%\n(2.4)%\nInterest, net\n0.8%\n0.5%\n0.5%\nOther reconciling items, net\n0.5%\n(0.7)%\n(1.8)%\nEffective rate\n19.0%\n13.1%\n13.8%\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax.","687":"Income Taxes\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entitys financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\nPART II\nItem 7","688":"Income Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.\nPART II\nItem 8\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\nWe read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.","689":"Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies","690":"We operate manufacturing facilities for the production and customization of phones, predominantly in Vietnam.

We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nDuring fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, research and development expense was $12.0 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.4 billion, respectively.

This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of multiple siloed businesses.\nOur employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels, employee Q&A sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support.","699":"More Personal Computing operating income decreased $938 million or 17%, primarily due to higher operating expenses, as well as a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased $364 million or 2%, reflecting a reduction in Windows gross margin, offset in part by an increase in devices gross margin. Cost of revenue increased $5.1 billion or 28%, driven by higher phones cost of revenue, as well as higher Xbox Live and search infrastructure costs, offset in part by a reduction in Windows Phone cost of revenue. Phones cost of revenue increased $4.8 billion, reflecting a full year of phone sales in fiscal year 2015. Windows Phone cost of revenue decreased $897 million, driven by prior year costs associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS. Operating expenses increased $574 million or 4%, driven by a full year of NDS expenses. Research and development expenses increased $346 million or 5%, mainly due to increased investment in new product and services, including higher phone expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $211 million or 3%, primarily due to higher phone expenses, offset in part by a decline in advertising and other marketing program costs.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and Other revenue primarily comprises certain revenue deferrals, including those related to Windows 10, Bundled Offerings, and video games.

We continued to make progress on our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3 represented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the use of our products across our customers.","701":"A few examples of our continued progress include:\nSigned new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts.\nContracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.\nDiverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint.\nProtected 12,270 acres of land in Belize - more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world.\nMicrosoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single company, organization, or government.

Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue.

Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by managements application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nJudgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products and are accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.\nSoftware updates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade, which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered. If it is determined that implied post-contract customer support (PCS) is being provided, revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. If updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available.","706":"Liquidity\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions.

The third quarter in fiscal 2023 and 2022 ended on October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management estimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n3.Revenue\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue.

The higher income tax expense is primarily due\nto less tax benefit from the income tax accounting for share-based compensation and an increase in state tax expense compared to fiscal 2021.\nNet income\nNet income increased $256.6 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $985.8 million in fiscal 2021.

There can be no assurance that any stock repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock.\nClimate change might adversely impact our business operations and\/or our supply chain.\nScientific consensus shows that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will in the future cause changes in weather patterns around the globe. Climatologists predict these changes will result in the increased frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters which could disrupt our business operations or those of our suppliers. These weather events could also lead to an increased rate of temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic at our stores. In addition, concern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in new or additional legal, legislative, and\/or regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the\nenvironment. Any such new requirements could increase our operating costs for things like energy or packaging, as well as our product supply chain and distribution costs.","759":"Weighted-average common shares - Diluted\n51,738\n54,841\n56,558\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n24.17\n$\n18.09\n$\n3.12\nDiluted\n$\n24.01\n$\n17.98\n$\n3.11\nThe denominator for diluted net income per common share for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 excludes 84, 205, and 211 employee stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects.

The third quarter in fiscal 2023 and 2022 ended on October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management estimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n3.Revenue\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are anticipated to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in income tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period of enactment. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized unless it is more-likely-than-not that such assets will be realized in full. The estimated tax benefit of an uncertain tax position is\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge, if any, from applicable taxing authorities.\nJudgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A.

Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives are recognized in earnings, they are generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an investing activity.

The CECL allowance is based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are estimated using relevant information about the collectibility of cash flows and consider information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","794":"2022-04,Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 450-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations This update is to provide additional information and disclosures about an entitys use of supplier finance programs to see how these programs will affect an entitys working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Entities that use supplier finance programs as the buyer party should disclose (1) the key terms of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided and (2) the unpaid amount outstanding, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and a rollforward of those obligations during the annual period. In each interim reporting period, the buyer must disclose the unpaid amount outstanding at the end of the interim period. For fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The ASU only requires disclosures related to the Company's supplier finance programs and does not affect the recognition, measurement, or presentation of supplier finance program obligations on the balance sheet or cash flow statement. The Company expects to adopt the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of 2023, except for the annual requirement to disclose rollforward information, which the Company expects to adopt and present prospectively beginning in the 2024 annual financial statements.\n2. INVENTORY\nInventory is valued primarily using the average-cost method. The following table summarizes the Company's inventory balances as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nFuel and other raw materials $ 733 $ 366\nSpare parts and supplies 322 238\nTotal $ 1,055 $ 604\n3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT","795":"Long-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $23,039 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Companys useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $661 million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n127 | 2022 Annual Report","796":"ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.\nINVENTORY - Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).","797":"Other financial assets - Application of ASC 326 to the Companys $1.5 billion of trade accounts receivable and $326 million of available-for-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of these financial assets. Additionally, a large portion of our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy GAAP arise from arrangements accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326.\nAs discussed in Note 7-Financing Receivables, AES Andes recorded $33 million of noncurrent receivables at December 31, 2020 pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October 2019. The Company expects to collect these noncurrent receivables through the execution of sale agreements with third parties. However, given the investment grade rating of Chile and the history of zero credit losses for regulated customers, management determined that no incremental CECL reserves were required to be recognized as of January 1, 2020.\n145 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective - The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements once adopted.

Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.-Risk Factors include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with our Operations\nThe operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks.\nWe are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:","802":"In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.","803":"To test the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives, our audit procedures included, among others, making inquiries of management, including personnel in operations, to understand changes in the businesses and managements strategic plans, and evaluate whether management has considered any identified changes in their analysis. We evaluated the results of earnings and the projected cash flows for significant coal generation assets and assessed whether there has been a deterioration in earnings or projected losses that would represent an impairment indicator. We also evaluated conditions and trends in the industry for the underlying economies, including any sale or disposition activities, and evaluated any adverse changes in the regulatory environment or the geographic areas to test the completeness and accuracy of the company's evaluation of potential impairment indicators.

This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations - In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions - The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity - The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction.","806":"In February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal.

In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.","809":"In addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits that were dismissed against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions.

Objections of or challenges by local communities or interest groups may delay or impede permitting for our development projects.\nIn certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though they have not yet secured financing, PPAs, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment without having financing, a PPA or critical permits in place (or enter into a PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without agreed financing).\nIf the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may retain certain liabilities. Furthermore, we may undertake significant development costs and subsequently not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will reach commercial operation.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and\/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020","825":"In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions.

Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.","826":"Barry - The Company holds a 100% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES","832":"Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.\nWe have 28 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and\/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 15-Benefit Plans included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nImpairment of long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.","833":"Cyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.\nOur business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. In particular, there has been an increased focus on the U.S. energy grid believed to be related to the Russia\/Ukraine conflict. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach may:\nimpact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships;\nexpose us to legal claims and\/or regulatory investigations and proceedings;\nrequire extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks;\nimpair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities; and\nimpact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.","834":"The financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in Puerto Rico. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, and may have to sell power at market prices. A counterparty's breach by of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including the affected businesses debt agreements. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may incur significant expenditures to adapt to our businesses to technological changes.\nEmerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. Technological changes that could impact our businesses include:\n65 | 2022 Annual Report","835":"Other (6)\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 20\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $10 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC decreased $4 million, mainly driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020\nOperating Margin increased $30 million, or 16%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):\nIncrease at Maritza and St. Nikola primarily driven by higher electricity prices in Bulgaria and higher generation $ 19\nImproved operational performance at Mong Duong 4\nOther 7\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 30\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $20 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC increased $19 million driven by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties\nDuring 2023 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.-Business and Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOperational","836":"In addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets."}}
