When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, management's assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies.\nIn the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management's assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable","22":"We classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments.\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale.

Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or flooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola systems bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and\/or may result in increased disclosure obligations.

If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola systems impact on the environment by, for example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups.

Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important sources of ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate water scarcity and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the Coca-Cola systems bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. Increased energy or compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

In 2022, we derived $27.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.","59":"Refer to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTHE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWhen used in these notes, the terms The Coca-Cola Company, Company, we, us and our mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\nDescription of Business\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company.

The complaint alleges that certain public statements made by the Company during the Class Period were rendered materially false and misleading (which, allegedly, caused the Companys stock to trade at artificially inflated prices) by the defendants failure to disclose that, among other things, PayPals business practices with respect to PayPal Credit and regarding interchange rates paid to its bank partner related to its bank-issued co-branded debit cards were non-compliant with applicable laws and\/or regulations.

The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.\nAdditionally, in connection with transactions occurring in multiple currencies on our payments platform, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates and when transactions occur.\nKEY METRICS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nKEY METRICS\nTPV, number of payment transactions, active accounts, and number of payment transactions per active account are key non-financial performance metrics (key metrics) that management uses to measure the scale of our platform and the relevance of our products and services to our customers, and are defined as follows:\nTPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\nNumber of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.","186":"Global and regional economic conditions could harm our business.\nAdverse global and regional economic conditions such as turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets, including, but not limited to, tightening in the credit markets, extreme volatility or distress in the financial markets (including the fixed income, credit, currency, equity, and commodity markets), higher unemployment, high consumer debt levels, recessionary or inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, reduced consumer confidence or economic activity, government fiscal and tax policies, U.S. and international trade relationships, agreements, treaties, tariffs and restrictive actions, the inability of a government to enact a budget in a fiscal year, government shutdowns, government austerity programs, and other negative financial news or macroeconomic developments could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services, including a reduction in the volume and size of transactions on our payments platform.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

(Blue Buffalo), partially offset by higher SG&A expenses in fiscal 2020. Diluted earnings per share of $3.56 increased 23 percent compared to fiscal 2019.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","215":"521.8\n373.7\n295.1\nEarnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures\n2,082.0\n2,135.6\n2,271.3\nIncome taxes\n367.8\n57.3\n655.2\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures\n72.0\n84.7\n85.0\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n1,786.2\n2,163.0\n1,701.1\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n33.5\n32.0\n43.6\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$ 1,752.7\n$ 2,131.0\n$ 1,657.5\nEarnings per share - basic\n$ 2.92\n$ 3.69\n$ 2.82\nEarnings per share - diluted\n$ 2.90\n$ 3.64\n$ 2.77\nDividends per share\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.96\n$ 1.92\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests.

We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %","254":"nationalization of operations;\ncompliance with anti-corruption regulations;\nuncertainty relating to the United Kingdoms planned exit from the European Union;\nforeign tax treaties and policies; and\nrestriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Of our three reportable segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, it has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nWalmart International consists of our operations outside of the U.S. and includes retail, wholesale and other businesses. These categories, including eCommerce, consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry. Overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown in recent years by adding retail, wholesale and other units, and expanding eCommerce.\nSam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs as well as eCommerce through samsclub.com. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nEach of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.","269":"Walmart U.S. Segment\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. Walmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands. Walmart U.S. had net sales of $341.0 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 66% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $331.7 billion and $318.5 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nOmni-channel. Walmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, through services such as \"Same Day Pickup,\" \"Same Day Delivery,\" \"Delivery Unlimited,\" \"NextDay Delivery,\" and \"Endless Aisle.\" As of January 31, 2020, we had nearly 3,200 grocery pickup locations and over 1,600 delivery locations. We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of which is walmart.com. We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated online through our websites or through a mobile app. eCommerce sales may be fulfilled by a number of methods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers or our stores.

Walmart U.S. does business in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:","270":"Gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points for fiscal 2018 and increased 24 basis points for fiscal 2017, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2018, the decrease was primarily due to strategic price investments and the mix impact from eCommerce. Partially offsetting the negative factors for fiscal 2018 was the positive impact of savings from procuring merchandise. For fiscal 2017, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved margin in food and consumables, including the impact of savings in procuring merchandise and lower transportation expense from lower fuel costs.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales was relatively flat for fiscal 2018 and increased 101 basis points for fiscal 2017, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 included charges related to discontinued real estate projects of $244 million and $249 million, respectively. For fiscal 2017, the increase was primarily driven by an increase in wage expense due to the investment in the associate wage structure; the charge related to discontinued real estate projects; and investments in digital retail and technology. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2017 was partially offset by the impact of store closures in fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $124 million for fiscal 2018 and decreased $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017, respectively.\nWalmart International Segment\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts)\nNet sales\n$\n118,068\n$\n116,119\n$\n123,408\nPercentage change from comparable period\n1.7\n%\n(5.9\n)%\n(9.4\n)%\nOperating income\n$\n5,352\n$\n5,758\n$\n5,346\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales\n4.5\n%\n5.0\n%\n4.3\n%\nUnit counts at period end\n6,360\n6,363\n6,299\nRetail square feet at period end","271":"(8\n)\n(245\n)\n(7,234\n)\n-\n(7,487\n)\n-\n(7,487\n)\nCash dividend declared to noncontrolling interest\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(488\n)\n(488\n)\nNoncontrolling interest of acquired entity\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,345\n4,345\nOther\n(17\n)\n-\nBalances as of January 31, 2019\n2,878\n$\n$\n2,965\n$\n80,785\n$\n(11,542\n)\n$\n72,496\n$\n7,138\n$\n79,634\nSee accompanying notes.\nWalmart Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal Years Ended January 31,\n(Amounts in millions)\nCash flows from operating activities:\nConsolidated net income\n$\n7,179\n$\n10,523\n$\n14,293\nAdjustments to reconcile consolidated net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n10,678\n10,529\n10,080\nUnrealized (gains) and losses\n3,516\n-\n-\n(Gains) and losses for disposal of business operations\n4,850\n-\n-\nDeferred income taxes\n(499\n)\n(304\n)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n3,136\n-\nOther operating activities\n1,734\n1,210\nChanges in certain assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions:\nReceivables, net\n(368\n)\n(1,074\n)\n(402\n)\nInventories\n(1,311\n)\n(140\n)\n1,021\nAccounts payable\n1,831\n4,086\n3,942\nAccrued liabilities\n1,280\nAccrued income taxes\n(40\n)\n(557\n)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n27,753\n28,337\n31,673\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPayments for property and equipment\n(10,344\n)\n(10,051\n)\n(10,619\n)\nProceeds from the disposal of property and equipment\nProceeds from the disposal of certain operations\n1,046\nPurchase of available for sale securities\n-\n-\n(1,901\n)\nPayments for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n(14,656\n)\n(375\n)\n(2,463\n)\nOther investing activities\n(431\n)\n(77\n)\n(31\n)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(24,036\n)\n(9,079\n)\n(13,896\n)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nNet change in short-term borrowings\n(53\n)\n4,148\n(1,673\n)\nProceeds from issuance of long-term debt\n15,872\n7,476\nRepayments of long-term debt\n(3,784\n)\n(13,061\n)\n(2,055\n)\nPremiums paid to extinguish debt\n-\n(3,059\n)\n-\nDividends paid\n(6,102\n)\n(6,124\n)\n(6,216\n)\nPurchase of Company stock\n(7,410\n)\n(8,296\n)\n(8,298\n)","272":"Fiscal Period\nTotal Number of\nShares Repurchased\nAverage Price Paid\nper Share\n(in dollars)\nTotal Number of\nShares Purchased\nas Part of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nPrograms\nApproximate Dollar Value of\nShares that May Yet Be\nPurchased Under the\nPlans or Programs(1)\n(in billions)\nNovember 1-30, 2017\n6,816,775\n$\n93.00\n6,816,775\n$\n19.8\nDecember 1-31, 2017\n5,594,137\n97.92\n5,594,137\n19.2\nJanuary 1-31, 2018\n4,170,041\n102.37\n4,170,041\n18.8\nTotal\n16,580,953\n16,580,953\n(1) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares that could have been purchased under the current plan at the end of the month.

For fiscal 2019, the increase was primarily due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and net sales from Flipkart, which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 billion reduction in net sales due to our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, a $0.7 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the continued wind down of our first party Brazil eCommerce operations and a reduction in net sales of $140 million due to divesting our Suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, the increase in net sales was due to positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and the impact of new stores, partially offset by a reduction in net sales of $1.9 billion due to divesting our Yihaodian and Suburbia businesses and a $0.5 billion negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates.","274":"Our effective income tax rate was 37.4% for fiscal 2019, 30.4% for fiscal 2018, and 30.3% for fiscal 2017. Although the U.S. statutory rate was lowered due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal 2019 primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil and Flipkart's results. Additionally, our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.

Sam's Club accounted for approximately 12% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income. Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.\nWalmart U.S. Segment\nThe Walmart U.S. segment is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart,\" \"Wal-Mart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood Market\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.

Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\nCompetition. Walmart International competes with both physical retailers who operate department, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale clubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and digital retailers, as well as catalog businesses. We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer credit operations. We compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated units. Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates. We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach. Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate. In the markets in which we have eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations.","292":"Fiscal Years Ended January 31,\nSTRATEGIC MERCHANDISE UNITS\nGrocery\n56%\n56%\n56%\nHealth and wellness\n11%\n11%\n11%\nGeneral merchandise\n33%\n33%\n33%\nTotal\n100%\n100%\n100%\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units.

We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:\nEDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\nEDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers;\nRollbacks: our commitment to pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;","293":"We may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold.

While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term potential strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 5.2% and 7.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in ROA was primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018. ROI was 14.2% and 15.2% for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decline in ROI was primarily due to the decrease in operating income for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018.\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average accumulated amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period, plus a rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing 12 months multiplied by a factor of eight. When we have discontinued operations, we exclude the impact of the discontinued operations.","298":"Return on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets.

Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.7% and 3.4% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to the increase in consolidated net income primarily due to the change in fair value of the investment in JD.com and lapping the $4.5 billion net loss recorded in fiscal 2019 related to the sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil, partially offset by the dilution to operating income related to Flipkart. ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the decrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets.","299":"ASDA Equal Value Claims: Ms S Brierley & Others v ASDA Stores Ltd (2406372\/2008 & Others - Manchester Employment Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Brierley & Ors (A2\/2016\/0973 - United Kingdom Court of Appeal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT\/0059\/16\/DM - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal); ASDA Stores Ltd v Ms S Brierley & Others (UKEAT\/0009\/16\/JOJ - United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal).\nNational Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the \"MDL\").

In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well as incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we created Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives with the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and expanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations.

All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are 50% or less owned and do not otherwise meet consolidation requirements, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These equity method investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2018 related to the operations consolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

ROI was 13.4% and 14.2% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in ROI was due to the decrease in operating income primarily as a result of the dilution from Flipkart as well as business restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2020. The denominator remained relatively flat as the increase in average total assets due to the acquisition of Flipkart was offset by the decrease in average invested capital resulting from the removal of the eight times rent factor upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASU 2016-02\") since operating lease right of use assets are now included in total assets.","313":"Return on Assets and Return on Investment\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics to assess returns on assets.

The following table provides square footage details on each of our formats as of January 31, 2018:\nMinimum Square Feet\nMaximum Square Feet\nAverage Square Feet","321":"Information About Our Segments\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as eCommerce. Walmart U.S. generated approximately 64% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\"). In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.\nWalmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce. Walmart International generated\napproximately 24% of our fiscal 2018 net sales. The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix. Walmart International is our second largest segment.","322":"As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores and clubs around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.","323":"Financial Risks\nFluctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from local currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. In recent years, fluctuations in currency exchange rates that were unfavorable have had adverse effects on our reported results of operations.\nAs a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.","324":"Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations. We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.

During fiscal 2018, we generated total revenues of $500.3 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of $495.8 billion.","330":"Walmart International includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other. These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, asda.com, walmart.ca, flipkart.com and other sites. Walmart International had net sales of $120.1 billion for fiscal 2020, representing 23% of our fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $120.8 billion and $118.1 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. The segment's net sales were negatively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations for all years presented. The gross profit rate is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.\nWalmart International's strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant and customer-focused in each of the markets it operates. We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate and continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth. As such, we have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, including:\nAcquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart in August 2018.\nDivestiture of 80 percent of Walmart Brazil to Advent International (Advent) in August 2018.\nDivestiture of the Walmart Chile banking operations in December 2018 and the divestiture of the Walmart Canada banking operations in April 2019.\nOmni-channel. Walmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, such as through services like \"Click & Collect\" in the United Kingdom, our grocery pick-up and delivery business in several other markets, our marketplaces, such as Flipkart in India, and a digital transaction platform anchored in payments such as PhonePe in India.","331":"In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com and then later that year, adding samsclub.com. Since then, our eCommerce presence has continued to grow. In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores. Since 2016, we have made several eCommerce acquisitions which have enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, as well as incubate digitally-native brands and expand our assortment on walmart.com and in stores. In fiscal 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping and we created Store No 8, a technology incubator with a focus to drive eCommerce innovation. Then in fiscal 2019, we continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives with the acquisition of a majority stake of Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), an Indian-based eCommerce marketplace, with an ecosystem that includes eCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra as well as PhonePe, a digital transaction platform.\nIn fiscal 2020, we launched NextDay Delivery to more than 75 percent of the U.S. population, launched Delivery Unlimited from 1,600 locations in the U.S. and expanded Same Day Pickup to nearly 3,200 locations. Our eCommerce efforts and innovation have also led to omni-channel offerings in many of our markets including grocery pick up and\/or delivery in nearly a dozen countries outside the U.S. To date, we now have more than 6,100 grocery pick up and delivery locations globally. We are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, services, eCommerce sites, supply chain combined with our more than 2.2 million associates to better serve our customers.

exchange rates, and interest rates. We monitor and manage these exposures as part of our overall risk management program. Our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results. We maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. We manage market risk by incorporating parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments, the derivative strategies we use, and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instruments. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 13, Financial Instruments, in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for details of our market risk management policies and the financial instruments used to hedge those exposures.\nWhen we use financial instruments, we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement. We minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty, and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties. We maintain a policy of requiring that all significant, non-exchange traded derivative contracts are governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreement. By policy, we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nEffect of Hypothetical 10% Fluctuation in Market Prices:","454":"Divestiture Hedging:\nWe entered into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the Heinz India Transaction. In 2018, the related derivative losses were $20 million, including $17 million recorded within other expense\/(income) and $3 million recorded within interest expense. These derivative contracts settled in the first quarter of 2019 resulting in a gain of $5 million, including a gain of $6 million recorded within other expense\/(income) and a loss of $1 million recorded within interest expense. These losses are classified as other losses\/(gains) related to acquisitions and divestitures. Additionally, we entered into foreign exchange contracts which were designated as net investment hedges related to our investment in Heinz India. Related to these net investment hedges, we had unrealized hedge losses of $10 million as of December 29, 2018, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income\/(losses). In 2019, these net investment hedges settled at a loss of $6 million. This loss was subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income\/(losses) to other expense\/(income) in the consolidated statement of income in the first quarter of 2019 when the Heinz India Transaction closed. These losses are classified as losses\/(gains) on the sale of a business. See Note 4, Acquisitions and Divestitures, for additional information related to the Heinz India Transaction.\nDerivative Impact on the Statements of Comprehensive Income:\nThe following table presents the pre-tax amounts of derivative gains\/(losses) deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income\/(losses) and the income statement line item that will be affected when reclassified to net income\/(loss) (in millions):\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\/(Losses) Component\nGains\/(Losses) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income\/(Losses) Related to Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments","455":"23.1\nConsent of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.*\n24.1\nPower of Attorney.*\n31.1\nCertification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to Rule 13a 14(a)\/15d 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.*\n31.2\nCertification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to Rule 13a 14(a)\/15d 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.*\n32.1\nCertification of Chief Executive Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.*\n32.2\nCertification of Chief Financial Officer pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1350, as adopted pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.*\n101.1\nThe following materials from The Kraft Heinz Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 28, 2019 formatted in inline XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language): (i) the Consolidated Statements of Income, (ii) the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, (iii) the Consolidated Balance Sheets, (iv) the Consolidated Statements of Equity, (v) the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, (vi) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and (vii) document and entity information.*\n104.1\nThe cover page from The Kraft Heinz Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 28, 2019, formatted in inline XBRL.*\n+\nIndicates a management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement.\n*\nFiled herewith.\nItem 16.

In relation to foreign currency contracts, this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar. Our utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in our portfolio of financial instruments are a function of our results of operations, debt repayments and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities.\nEffect of Hypothetical 1% Fluctuation in LIBOR and CDOR:\nBased on our current variable rate debt balance as of December 28, 2019, a hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR and CDOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Given our current variable rate debt outstanding, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our annual interest expense as a result of the transition. Item 8.

Our Vision is To Be the Best Food Company, Growing a Better World. We are one of the largest global food and beverage companies, with 2019 net sales of approximately $25 billion. Our portfolio is a diverse mix of iconic and emerging brands. As the guardians of these brands and the creators of innovative new products, we are dedicated to the sustainable health of our people and our planet.\nOn July 2, 2015, through a series of transactions, we consummated the merger of Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (Kraft) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of H.J. Heinz Holding Corporation (Heinz) (the 2015 Merger). At the closing of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was renamed The Kraft Heinz Company, and H. J. Heinz Company changed its name to Kraft Heinz Foods Company.\nBefore the consummation of the 2015 Merger, Heinz was controlled by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (Berkshire Hathaway) and 3G Global Food Holdings, L.P. (3G Capital) (together, the Sponsors), following their acquisition of H. J.

Contingencies and Legal Proceedings\nContingencies - Brazil\nThe Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company will vigorously defend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the liquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates.\nAs of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 million, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases referenced above.\nContingencies - Environmental Matters","481":"Total current liabilities 3,973.6 4,541.8\nNon-current liabilities:\nLong-term debt, less current portion 6,028.4 5,309.0\nOperating lease liabilities 465.7 -\nDeferred tax liabilities 672.4 1,011.7\nEmployee benefit obligations 391.7 386.8\nOther non-current liabilities 223.2 241.0\nTotal non-current liabilities 7,781.4 6,948.5\nTotal liabilities 11,755.0 11,490.3\nCommitments and contingencies (See Note 19)\nShareholders' Equity\nAmcor plc shareholders equity:\nOrdinary shares ($0.01 par value):\nAuthorized (9,000.0 shares)\nIssued (1,568.5 and 1,625.9 shares, respectively)\n15.7 16.3\nAdditional paid-in capital 5,480.0 6,007.5\nRetained earnings 246.5 323.7\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (1,049.3) (722.4)\nTreasury shares (6.7 and 1.4 shares, respectively)\n(67.0) (16.1)\nTotal Amcor plc shareholders' equity 4,625.9 5,609.0\nNon-controlling interest 61.2 65.7\nTotal shareholders' equity 4,687.1 5,674.7\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 16,442.1 $ 17,165.0\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nAmcor plc and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n(in millions)\nFor the years ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income $ 616.6 $ 437.4 $ 586.6\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nDepreciation, amortization and impairment 651.6 453.0 357.1\nNet periodic benefit cost 9.1 12.5 7.7\nAmortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs 8.1 5.8 5.1\nAmortization of deferred gain on sale and leasebacks - (7.0) (4.4)\nNet gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment (3.6) (16.0) (18.2)\nGain on disposal of U.S. plants - (159.1) -\nEquity in (income) loss of affiliated companies 14.0 (4.1) 17.5\nNet foreign exchange (gain) loss (16.2) (5.1) 85.9\nShare-based compensation 34.0 18.6 21.0\nOther, net (0.2) (77.9) 0.4\nLoss from hyperinflationary accounting for Argentine subsidiaries 37.9 30.2 -\nDeferred income taxes, net (113.7) 72.8 (73.5)","482":"To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares.

These customized loan offers eliminate the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process for the seller, while facilitating prudent risk management. The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Sellers can use these funds to make investments in their business, such as purchasing inventory or equipment, hiring additional employees, expanding their stores, or opening new locations.\nGenerally, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. By simply running their business, sellers repay their loan within an average of nine months. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding significantly increases the speed with which we can scale Square Capital services and allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk.\nSince its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated over 200,000 loans and merchant cash advances (MCAs), representing $1.3 billion.\nCaviar","547":"Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility\nOn June 2, 2020, Square Capital was approved to borrow under the PPPLF with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, at an annual interest rate of 0.35%. The PPPLF extends credit to eligible financial institutions that have originated or purchased PPP loans. Advances under the PPPLF are non-recourse and are secured by a pledge of PPP loans held by Square Capital. The maturity date of any PPPLF loan will be the maturity date of the PPP loans pledged to secure such PPPLF loan. The maturity date of any PPPLF loan will be accelerated on and to the extent of (i) the date of any loan forgiveness reimbursement by the SBA for any PPP loan securing such PPPLF loan; or (ii) the date of purchase by the SBA from Square Capital of any PPP loan securing such PPPLF loan to realize on the SBAs guarantee of such PPP loan. The maturity date of all PPPLF Loans shall be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain events of default by Square Capital, including but not limited to the failure to comply with a requirement of the PPPLF agreement or any representation, warranty, or covenant of Square Capital under the PPPLF agreement being inaccurate on or as of the date it is deemed to be made or on any date on which an PPPLF loan remains outstanding. The Company can also at its option prepay the advances in full or in part without penalty. Square Capital also shall prepay PPPLF loans so that the amount of any PPPLF loans outstanding does not exceed the outstanding amount of PPP loans pledged to secure such PPPLF loans. As of December 31, 2020, $464.1 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, approximately $376.3 million of PPPLF advances were outstanding and collateralized by the same value of the PPP loans as of February 23, 2021.\nConvertible Senior Notes due in 2026 and 2027","548":"Square Capital facilitates loans to qualified Square sellers through a partnership with an industrial bank. Square Capital eliminates the lengthy (and often unsuccessful) loan application process.

The terms are straightforward for sellers, and once approved, they get their funds quickly, often the next business day. Generally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller's expected annual GPV and, by simply running their business, sellers historically have repaid their loan in less than nine months on average. We currently fund a majority of these loans from arrangements with institutional third-party investors who purchase these loans on a forward-flow basis. This funding allows us to mitigate our balance sheet and liquidity risk. Since its public launch in May 2014, Square Capital has facilitated more than 1.2 million loans and advances, representing more than $8.1 billion. This includes approximately $857 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, excluding cancelled loans, to more than 80,000 sellers, which Square Capital facilitated in 2020.\nSquare Payroll allows sellers to easily hire and onboard employees, pay wages and associated employee taxes, and offer employee benefits (e.g. 401(k) accounts).

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA","553":"Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the receivables, unable to make repayment of loans and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the loan. Sellers are contractually obligated to use Square as their only card payment processing service until the agreed-upon fixed amount of receivables or repayment of loans is made. To the extent a seller breaches this obligation, the seller would be liable for the balance of the receivables in respect of an MCA or an accelerated loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions could lead to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated loans and strain our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage\nthe risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the loans. Similarly, if we fail to correctly predict or price the loans to sellers utilizing Square Capital, our business may be materially and adversely affected.","554":"The business loans are generally unsecured obligations of our Square sellers who utilize Square Capital, and they are not guaranteed or insured in any way. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","555":"Company\/Index\n11\/19\/2015\n12\/31\/2015\n12\/31\/2016\nSquare, Inc.\n100.15\n104.28\nS&P 500\n98.72\n110.52\nS&P North American Technology\n99.20\n111.15 Item 6.

However, sellers also need innovative solutions to thrive, and we have since expanded to provide additional products and services to provide these businesses with access to the same tools as large businesses. Square is a cohesive commerce ecosystem that combines sophisticated software with affordable hardware to enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into powerful payments and point-of-sale solutions. We focus on technology and design to create products and services that are cohesive, fast, self-serve, and dependable.","558":"Additionally, we continue to add features to Square Point of Sale to better meet the needs of specific industries, such as services, retail, and food-related sellers. Sellers in the services industry can enable their customers to easily schedule appointments with their preferred time, service, and staff member. Sellers can also send invoices to their customers email address, creating a seamless experience from booking to payment. And sellers in food-related industries, like bars and restaurants, can easily create, save, add to, split, and close tickets (with tip).\nWe recently launched Square for Retail, our first industry-specific point of sale that is purpose-built for retailers with sophisticated management needs. Square for Retail is an end-to-end solution that fully integrates with our managed payments solutions and hardware. It has a search-based user interface and fast barcode scanning; advanced inventory management that supports tens of thousands of items, cost of goods sold, purchase orders; and employee management and advanced client\u00e8ling capabilities that allow retail sellers to better understand their customers habits.\nDeveloper platform\nWe have opened Square to reach sellers who want access to our ecosystem but also want flexibility in their solutions to meet their individualized business needs. Build with Square is our developer platform, consisting of various application program interfaces (APIs) that allow sellers and their developers to customize business solutions. Our Point-of-Sale API allows sellers to integrate any iOS or Android point of sale with Square to accept payments and access all other services in the ecosystem. This is particularly useful for sellers with highly-individualized point-of-sale needs. With our e-commerce API, sellers can integrate Square with their e-commerce website, giving them the ability to track, manage, and grow both their online and offline businesses in a single dashboard.","559":"Square Capital, which includes our wholly owned subsidiary Square Capital, LLC, is subject to risks in addition to those described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Maintaining and growing Square Capital is dependent on institutional third-party investors purchasing the eligible business loans originated by our bank partner. If such third parties fail to continue to purchase such business loans or reduce the amount of future loans they purchase, then our bank partner may need to reduce originations, or we would need to fund the purchase of additional business loans from our own resources. We then may have to reduce the scale of Square Capital, which could have a direct impact on our ability to grow. Additionally, Square Capital has certain customary repurchase obligations in its loan purchase and servicing agreements with such institutional third party investors for breaches of certain eligibility representations and warranties. If third parties reduce the price they are willing to pay for these business loans or reduce the servicing fees they pay us in exchange for servicing the business loans on their behalf, then the financial performance of Square Capital would be harmed.","560":"Although this program is functional, it may prove to be inadequate, increasing the risk of interruptions in our services, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.

It consists of managed payments solutions and advanced software products, all of which are integrated with one another to provide both sellers and their buyers with a cohesive experience that is fast, self-serve, and dependable. Square Point of Sale also includes Square Dashboard, our cloud-based reporting and analytics tool that provides sellers with real-time data and insights about sales, items, customers, and employees. This enables sellers to make informed decisions about their business. We monetize these features through either a per transaction fee, a subscription fee, or a service fee.\nOur advanced point-of-sale features are ideal for a seller with a more complex business or for a seller who has multiple employees and\/or locations. Location and employee management allows a seller to track sales by location, device, or employee; customize employee permissions; and create employee timecards. Square Payroll empowers sellers to grow by making it easy to hire, onboard, and pay employees and the associated taxes. Square Point of Sale also provides customer engagement tools that help sellers grow their business through digital customer feedback, marketing, and loyalty programs. By linking customer data with point-of-sale and transaction data, we can offer targeted marketing campaigns and a closed-loop system that allows sellers to easily assess the return on investment of their marketing efforts.","562":"How We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our\nAudit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys Convertible Senior Notes Transactions.

We involved a valuation specialist in our testing of the fair value of the liability component, including evaluating the Companys selection of the valuation methodology and other significant assumptions used by the Company. We have evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. Specifically, when assessing the fair value assumptions, we evaluated the Companys estimates of its credit risk, equity volatility, dividend yield and the market risk free rate as well as its analysis of comparable issuances of debt securities by companies with a similar credit risk rating.\n\/s\/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 23, 2021\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Square, Inc.","563":"From a total rewards perspective, Square offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, which we review and update each year.

These sanctions could adversely impact our reputation and our business, require us to expend significant funds for remediation, and expose us to litigation and other potential liability.","568":"Economic, Financial, and Tax Risks\nA deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of spending by businesses and individuals. Most of the sellers that use our services are small businesses, many of which are in the early stages of their development, and these businesses are often disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns and may fail at a higher rate than larger or more established businesses. In fact, small businesses have been, and continue to be, disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related measures taken by governments and private industry to protect the public health such as stay-at-home orders. Many businesses are experiencing reduced sales and are processing fewer payments with us, which has had a negative impact on our results of operations. If they cease to operate, they will likely stop using our products and services altogether. Small businesses frequently have limited budgets and limited access to capital, and they may choose to allocate their spending to items other than our financial or marketing services, especially in times of economic uncertainty or in recessions. In addition, if more of our sellers cease to operate, this may have an adverse impact not only on the growth of our payments services but also on our transaction and advance loss rates, and the success of our other services. For example, if sellers processing payments with us receive chargebacks after they cease to operate, we may incur additional losses. Additionally, the growth in the number of sellers qualifying for participation in the Square Capital program may slow, or business loans may be paid more slowly, or not at all. In addition, as we expand our business to offer consumer financing products, those customers may also be disproportionately adversely affected by economic downturns.","569":"19,292\n26,776\nLong-term investments\n27,366\n-\nRestricted cash\n14,584\n14,686\nOther assets\n3,194\n3,826\nTotal assets\n$\n1,211,362\n$\n894,772\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n12,602\n$\n18,869\nCustomers payable\n388,058\n215,365\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\n9,446\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\n17,176\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\n44,401\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\n28,945\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n334,202\nDebt (Note 11)\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n57,745\n52,522\nTotal liabilities\n635,209\n386,724\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000001 par value: 100,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

In the event that it is determined that a borrower does not qualify for loan forgiveness or if a borrower defaults on its PPP loan, Square Capital is at risk to the extent the SBA may decline to honor its guarantee or to forgive the loan due to documentation or verification errors, failure to follow regulatory requirements, or lack of adherence to underwriting standards. As a result, Square Capitals documentation and review and underwriting processes will be subject to scrutiny, and we could incur losses if we fail to comply with the SBA documentation and other requirements. We also may become subject to litigation arising as a result of our participation in this program, which could result in significant financial liability or could adversely affect our reputation. There can be no assurance that Square Capital will be successful in mitigating all of the risks associated with the PPP or that this lending will not have a negative impact on Square Capitals business and results of operations.","572":"The business loans are generally unsecured obligations of our Square sellers who utilize Square Capital, and they are not guaranteed or insured in any way. Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","573":"19,292\n26,776\nLong-term investments\n27,366\n-\nRestricted cash\n14,584\n14,686\nOther assets\n3,194\n3,826\nTotal assets\n$\n1,211,362\n$\n894,772\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$\n12,602\n$\n18,869\nCustomers payable\n388,058\n215,365\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\n9,446\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\n17,176\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\n44,401\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\n28,945\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n334,202\nDebt (Note 11)\n-\n-\nOther liabilities\n57,745\n52,522\nTotal liabilities\n635,209\n386,724\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.0000001 par value: 100,000,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Recently, the PPP was extended until March 31, 2021 and an additional $284 billion was allocated to fund a second round of PPP loans. The PPP was intended to provide funding for businesses so they can retain employees and includes initial loan repayment deferrals and debt forgiveness provisions for eligible borrowers. Additionally, borrowers may now qualify for a second-draw loan generally under the same terms and conditions as their initial loans. Small businesses who received a PPP loan previously can apply for a second loan if they: (i) employ fewer than 300 employees, (ii) experienced at least a 25% decrease in revenue in any quarter in 2020 relative to same quarter in 2019, and (iii) have already used or will use the full amount of their first PPP loan. Under the program, Square Capital, through a bank partner (and directly with respect to the second round of PPP loans), provides small businesses two-year or five-year loans at a fixed interest rate of one percent for up to 2.5 times (or 3.5 times with respect to restaurants qualifying for a second PPP loan) the borrowers monthly payroll expenses. The loan is forgiven under the program if the loan proceeds are used for specified expenses, including payroll and benefit costs, rent payments, utilities, and mortgage and certain interest expenses; provided that at least 60% of the loan proceeds are utilized for qualifying payroll costs and the borrower maintains or rehires employees during the specified periods. As of December 31, 2020, Square Capital had facilitated approximately $857 million of PPP loans, excluding cancelled loans. Square Capital has retained some of these PPP loans in its portfolio, but also sold 100% participation","580":"The FDICs approval is also contingent on us entering into a Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement as well as a Parent Company Agreement. The Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement would require, among other things, that we maintain the leverage ratio of Square Financial Services at a minimum of 20 percent at all times; maintain a third-party line of credit for the benefit of Square Financial Services acceptable to the FDIC; purchase any loan from Square Financial Services at the greater of the cost basis or fair market value, if deemed necessary by the FDIC or Square Financial Services; and establish and maintain a reserve deposit at an unaffiliated third-party bank that Square Financial Services could draw upon in the event that we fail to provide sufficient funds to maintain Square Financial Services capital ratios at the required levels. The Parent Company Agreement would require, among other things, that we consent to the FDICs examination of us and our subsidiaries; limit our representation on Square Financial Services board of directors to no more than 25 percent; submit a contingency plan to the FDIC that describes likely scenarios of significant financial or operational stress and, if we were unable to serve as a source of financial strength, options for the orderly wind down or sale of Square Financial Services; and engage a third party to review and provide periodic reports concerning the effectiveness of our complaint response system. Jack Dorsey, who is considered our controlling shareholder in this context, also agreed to cause us to perform under these agreements.

Recently, the PPP was extended until March 31, 2021 and an additional $284 billion was allocated to fund a second round of PPP loans. The PPP was intended to provide funding for businesses so they can retain employees and includes initial loan repayment deferrals and debt forgiveness provisions for eligible borrowers. Additionally, borrowers may now qualify for a second-draw loan generally under the same terms and conditions as their initial loans. Small businesses who received a PPP loan previously can apply for a second loan if they: (i) employ fewer than 300 employees, (ii) experienced at least a 25% decrease in revenue in any quarter in 2020 relative to same quarter in 2019, and (iii) have already used or will use the full amount of their first PPP loan. Under the program, Square Capital, through a bank partner (and directly with respect to the second round of PPP loans), provides small businesses two-year or five-year loans at a fixed interest rate of one percent for up to 2.5 times (or 3.5 times with respect to restaurants qualifying for a second PPP loan) the borrowers monthly payroll expenses. The loan is forgiven under the program if the loan proceeds are used for specified expenses, including payroll and benefit costs, rent payments, utilities, and mortgage and certain interest expenses; provided that at least 60% of the loan proceeds are utilized for qualifying payroll costs and the borrower maintains or rehires employees during the specified periods. As of December 31, 2020, Square Capital had facilitated approximately $857 million of PPP loans, excluding cancelled loans. Square Capital has retained some of these PPP loans in its portfolio, but also sold 100% participation","583":"Additionally, we continue to add features to Square Point of Sale to better meet the needs of specific industries, such as services, retail, and food-related sellers.

Adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions or the credit quality of our Square sellers could cause some Square sellers who utilize Square Capital to cease operating or to experience a decline in their payment processing volume, thereby rendering them unable to make payment on the business loan and\/or extend the repayment period beyond the contractual repayment terms on the business loan. To the extent a seller breaches a contractual obligation, such as the requirement to make minimum payments or other breach, the seller would be liable for an accelerated business loan repayment, where Square Capital's recourse is to the business and not to any individual or other asset. In addition, because the servicing fees we receive from third party investors depend on the collectability of the business loans, if there is an increase in Square sellers who utilize Square Capital who are unable to make repayment of business loans, we will be unable to collect our entire servicing fee for such loans. While our exposure to loans that we sell to third parties is more limited, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on loan performance will increase risk loss for our owned loan portfolio.\nIn addition, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a decrease in the number of sellers eligible for Square Capital facilitated business loans and strained our ability to correctly identify such sellers on behalf of our bank partner or manage the risk of non-payment or fraud as servicer of the business","590":"Interest Rate Sensitivity\nCash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016, were held primarily in cash deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate bonds.

When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.","601":"Operating income:\n\u00b7\nOperating income margins increased 12.6 percentage points, primarily driven by the Communication Markets Division divestiture gain.\nYear 2017 results:\nSales in Electronics and Energy totaled $5.5 billion, up 11.7 percent in U.S. dollars.

Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of up to one year from the TCJAs enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as follows:\nTransition tax: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company recorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA.

As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with the transition tax.\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax expense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts.

This provisional amount was subject to adjustment during the measurement period of up to one year following the December 2017 enactment of the TCJA, as provided by SEC guidance.\nIn addition to providing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of the NRD resolution and enactment\/measurement period adjustments to the impact of the enactment of the TCJA.

In November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, which replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February 2019, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.

The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price\/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M typically uses the price\/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3M uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, in addition to using for businesses where the price\/earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted. 3M also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.\nAs described in Note 18, effective in the first quarter of 2018, 3M made business segment reporting changes. For any product moves that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed.

Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Companys commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices - such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers - at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Companys emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n\t\t\nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nExecutive Officers","616":"Interest Rates Risk:\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swaps at December 31, 2018 was $2.4 billion.

The related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges was included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. The Company may enter into other commodity price swaps to offset, in part, fluctuation and costs associated with the use of certain commodities and\n\t\t\nprecious metals.

The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Companys credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. The Companys credit ratings have served to lower 3Ms borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Companys capital structure could impact 3Ms credit ratings in the future.

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n3Ms businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3Ms four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit\/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in Corporate and Unallocated).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit\/loss (business segment operating income (loss) ) was updated.

In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n3Ms manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to Environmental Matters and Litigation in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).","622":"In the first six months of 2016, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps that expired in December 2016 with an aggregate notional amount of $300 million as a hedge against interest rate volatility associated with a forecasted issuance of fixed rate debt.

Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program.

This followed a decrease of $422 million when comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, which replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock in 2019. In February 2019, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the 61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n3Ms businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3Ms four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit\/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in Corporate and Unallocated).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit\/loss (business segment operating income (loss) ) was updated. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Companys business segments. The changes included the items described below.

Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $1.2 billion compared with December 31, 2021. Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.","634":"In New Jersey, 3M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, a publicly traded water utility serving customers in and around certain portions of Middlesex County, New Jersey, which alleges PFAS contamination of its water system. The Court denied 3Ms motion for summary judgment in October 2022 and a trial date has been set for October 2, 2023. The parties are exploring potential resolution in advance of trial. In September 2020, 3M was named a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the Pequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is scheduled to commence in June 2023 (Hopatcong) and July 2023 (Pequannock).\n3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 27 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. 3M has agreed to settle with the plaintiffs in ten cases that sought property damages, subject in certain cases to court approval, and 3Ms share is not considered material. Plaintiffs in the 17 remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their disabled adult children. In July 2022, plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against defendants other than 3M, which motion was denied by the court. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of these cases. In December 2022, an additional personal injury case was filed in New Jersey State court.","635":"Civil litigation - As of June 30, 2023, a total of eight actions against 3M Belgium are pending in Belgian civil courts, and 3M Belgium has received pre-litigation notices from individuals in Belgium indicating potential claims. The pending cases include claims by neighboring and other companies for alleged soil and wastewater or rainwater contamination with PFAS; and tort liability claims and an environmental injunction procedure by environmental NGOs and several hundred individuals. While most of the actions are in early stages, one of the actions, brought by a family living near the 3M Belgium plant, had a hearing in February 2023 and, in May 2023, the presiding judge awarded provisional damages in the amount of 500 euros each to four family members, and denied other damages. Another case, involving an environmental injunction procedure, was brought by environmental NGOs originally against 3M Belgiums contractors and later against 3M Belgium and seeks to accelerate the descriptive soil investigation and remediation process. In May 2023, the court denied the environmental injunction claim, subject to appeal.\nIn May 2023, the Netherlands government sent 3M Belgium a notice of liability stating it holds 3M Belgium liable for damages related to alleged PFAS contamination in the Netherlands. The notice purports to identify claims by the Netherlands government and references potential damages to other parties. 3M Belgium plans to meet with the Netherlands government to discuss the notice. 3M Belgium has also met with representatives of some of the private parties involved, which have indicated they may separately pursue claims.\nUnited States: Federal Activity","636":"PFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues, including if regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3Ms reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception.

Among other things, the TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, which provided a measurement period of up to one year from the TCJAs enactment date for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740. In connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $762 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and additional net charges of $176 million as measurement period adjustments in 2018. As further discussed below, 3M completed its accounting for the income tax effects of enactment of the TCJA as follows:\nTransition tax: 3M recorded a provisional income tax expense obligation of $745 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, the Company recorded an additional obligation of $97 million related to the transition tax portion of the TCJA.

As of December 31, 2018, 3M reflected $649 million in long-term income taxes payable associated with the transition tax.\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts: 3M remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21 percent under the TCJA. In the fourth quarter of 2017, 3M recorded a net income tax expense of $17 million related to remeasurement of deferred tax assets\/liabilities and other impacts. During 2018, 3M recorded an additional net tax expense of $79 million as an associated measurement period adjustment.","639":"Revenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.

Research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.253 billion in 2018, $1.352 billion in 2017 and $1.248 billion in 2016. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains\/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.\nThe Companys products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Companys research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nThe Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses.

This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own stock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2019 gross share repurchases to be between $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion.

Investing in 3Ms business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Companys primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nTotal debt:","647":"Managing currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program.

In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization.

Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Companys commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.","653":"Raw Materials\nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n3Ms manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to Environmental Matters and Litigation in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).","654":"Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (104) (62) 48\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (909) (70) 2,281\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 4,564 4,634 2,353\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 3,655 $ 4,564 $ 4,634\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.\n3M Company and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1.

Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled Cash Flows from Investing Activities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.","656":"Currency Effects:\n3M estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income by $42 million and $111 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.","659":"The following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement\/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow.

As anticipated, our change in phone strategy resulted in a reduction in units sold and associated expenses in fiscal year 2016, and this trend is expected to continue in fiscal year 2017.\nIndustry Trends","684":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/3\/2017\n4.16\nThirteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.525% Notes due 2050 and 2.675% Notes due 2060, dated as of June 1, 2020, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n6\/1\/2020\n4.17\nFourteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.921% Notes due 2052 and 3.041% Notes due 2062, dated as of March 17, 2021, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n3\/17\/2021\n4.18\nDescription of Securities\n10-K\n6\/30\/2019\n4.16\n8\/1\/2019\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.1\n10\/20\/2016\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2012\n10.4\n7\/26\/2012\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2018\n10.5\n8\/3\/2018\n10.6*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\nDEF14A\nAnnex C\n10\/16\/2017\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.26\n4\/26\/2018\n10.8*\nForm of Performance Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.27\n4\/26\/2018\n10.9\nAmended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.12\n10\/20\/2016\n10.10\nAssumption of Beneficiaries Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement\n10-K\n6\/30\/2020\n10.25\n7\/30\/2020\n10.11","685":"Microsoft Cloud revenue\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage\nGross margin percentage for our Microsoft Cloud business\nPART II\nItem 7\nProductivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud\nMetrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments.

Our vertically-integrated hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm if we fail to detect or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. We acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint or industry shortages, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products we may offer.\nOur software products also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.","688":"Filed\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.18*\nForm of Executive Officer Incentive Plan Stock Award Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.18\n10\/22\/15\n10.19*\nResignation Agreement and Full and Final Release of Claims between Microsoft Corporation and Steven Sinofsky\n10-K\n6\/30\/13\n10.19\n7\/30\/13\n10.21*\nStock Award Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan (Service-Based)\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.21\n10\/22\/15\n10.22*\nSenior Executive Severance Benefit Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.22\n10\/22\/15\n10.23*\nOffer Letter, dated February 3, 2014, between Microsoft Corporation and Satya Nadella\n8-K\n10.1\n2\/4\/14\n10.24*\nLong-Term Performance Stock Award Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and Satya Nadella\n10-Q\n12\/31\/14\n10.24\n1\/26\/15\n10.25*\nForm of Executive Officer Incentive Plan Performance Stock Award Agreement under the Microsoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/15\n10.25\n10\/22\/15\nComputation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges\nX\nSubsidiaries of Registrant\nX\n23.1\nConsent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nX\n31.1\nCertifications of Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nX\n31.2\nCertifications of Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nX\n32.1**\nCertifications of Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nX\n32.2**\nCertifications of Chief Financial Officer Pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nX\n101.INS\nXBRL Instance Document\nX\n101.SCH\nXBRL Taxonomy Extension Schema\nX\n101.CAL\nXBRL Taxonomy Extension Calculation Linkbase\nX\n101.DEF\nXBRL Taxonomy Extension Definition Linkbase\nX\n101.LAB\nXBRL Taxonomy Extension Label Linkbase\nX\n101.PRE\nXBRL Taxonomy Extension Presentation Linkbase\nX\n* Indicates a management contract or compensatory plan or arrangement\n** Furnished, not filed\n*** Form 8-K of LinkedIn Corporation\nSIGNATURES","689":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/3\/2017\n4.16\nThirteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.525% Notes due 2050 and 2.675% Notes due 2060, dated as of June 1, 2020, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n6\/1\/2020\n4.17\nFourteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.921% Notes due 2052 and 3.041% Notes due 2062, dated as of March 17, 2021, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n3\/17\/2021\n4.18\nDescription of Securities\n10-K\n6\/30\/2019\n4.16\n8\/1\/2019\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.1\n10\/20\/2016\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2012\n10.4\n7\/26\/2012\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2018\n10.5\n8\/3\/2018\n10.6*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\nDEF14A\nAnnex C\n10\/16\/2017\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.26\n4\/26\/2018\n10.8*\nForm of Performance Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.27\n4\/26\/2018\n10.9\nAmended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.12\n10\/20\/2016\n10.10\nAssumption of Beneficiaries Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement\n10-K\n6\/30\/2020\n10.25\n7\/30\/2020\n10.11","690":"We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices.

We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and new devices from third-party manufacturers so players can engage across PC, console, and mobile.

We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo!, in which we provide and monetize search results. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings.\nCompetition\nThe Windows operating system faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\nOur devices face competition from various computer, tablet, hardware, and phone manufacturers, and offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers. These manufacturers include Apple, as well as our Windows OEM partners.\nOur gaming platform competes with console platforms from Sony and Nintendo, both of which have a large, established base of customers.

Sony released their latest generation console in November 2013.","694":"The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.\nDeveloping new technologies is complex.

The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union (EU) Directive establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from 2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007 pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and France.\nOther patent and intellectual property claims\nIn addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2016.\nAntitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions\nAntitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and\/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.\nPART II\nItem 8","700":"PART II\nItem 8\nNOTE 17 - CONTINGENCIES\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nIPCom patent litigation\nIPCom GmbH & Co. (IPCom) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions.\nInterDigital patent litigation","701":"The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken. We have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices to help ensure a positive experience for our users installing Windows 10. However, if users have a negative upgrade experience, or the community reacts negatively to the process we are following to promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception of Windows 10 in the marketplace may be harmed, and customers or government agencies may bring litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, we anticipate that Windows 10 will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure to realize these opportunities to the extent we expect could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Finally, our practices around data collection, use, and management in Windows 10 could result in regulatory review and decisions directing us to change these practices and imposing fines. If so, we could face negative public reaction, degraded user experiences, and reduced flexibility in product design.\nDeveloping new technologies is complex.

Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.","703":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/3\/2017\n4.16\nThirteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.525% Notes due 2050 and 2.675% Notes due 2060, dated as of June 1, 2020, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n6\/1\/2020\n4.17\nFourteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.921% Notes due 2052 and 3.041% Notes due 2062, dated as of March 17, 2021, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n3\/17\/2021\n4.18\nDescription of Securities\n10-K\n6\/30\/2019\n4.16\n8\/1\/2019\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.1\n10\/20\/2016\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2012\n10.4\n7\/26\/2012\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2018\n10.5\n8\/3\/2018\n10.6*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\nDEF14A\nAnnex C\n10\/16\/2017\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.26\n4\/26\/2018\n10.8*\nForm of Performance Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.27\n4\/26\/2018\n10.9\nAmended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.12\n10\/20\/2016\n10.10\nAssumption of Beneficiaries Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement\n10-K\n6\/30\/2020\n10.25\n7\/30\/2020\n10.11","704":"The launch of Windows 10, with free upgrades available to existing users of Windows 7 and 8.1, constitutes the most ambitious update effort we have ever undertaken.

Gross margin increased $1.6 billion or 10%, driven by revenue growth from our server products and services. Gross margin included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 2%. Cost of revenue increased $404 million or 7%, mainly due to higher cloud infrastructure expenses, reflecting increased datacenter capacity for our Azure services. Operating expenses increased $151 million or 2%, driven by higher research and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased $160 million or 6%, mainly due to increased investment in new products and services.\nMore Personal Computing\nMore Personal Computing revenue increased $4.7 billion or 12%, mainly due to growth in Devices, search advertising, and Gaming revenue, offset in part by a decline in revenue from Windows.\nDevices revenue increased $7.0 billion or 152%, mainly due to a full year of phone sales and higher Surface revenue. Devices revenue included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately 5%. Phones revenue increased $5.5 billion, as we sold 36.8 million Lumia phones and 126.8 million other phones in fiscal year 2015, compared with 5.8 million and 30.3 million sold, respectively, in fiscal year 2014 following the acquisition of Nokia Corporations (Nokia) Devices and Services business (NDS). We acquired NDS in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. Surface revenue increased 65% to $3.6 billion, primarily due to Surface Pro 3 units sold. Surface Pro 3 was released in June 2014.","706":"Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nResearch and Development Costs\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\nLegal and Other Contingencies","707":"Through our Search, News, Mapping, and Browser services, Microsoft delivers unique trust, privacy, and safety features.

We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.","709":"8-K\n4.1\n2\/3\/2017\n4.16\nThirteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.525% Notes due 2050 and 2.675% Notes due 2060, dated as of June 1, 2020, between Microsoft Corporation and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n6\/1\/2020\n4.17\nFourteenth Supplemental Indenture for 2.921% Notes due 2052 and 3.041% Notes due 2062, dated as of March 17, 2021, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee, to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2009, between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n8-K\n4.1\n3\/17\/2021\n4.18\nDescription of Securities\n10-K\n6\/30\/2019\n4.16\n8\/1\/2019\n10.1*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2001 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.1\n10\/20\/2016\n10.4*\nMicrosoft Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2012\n10.4\n7\/26\/2012\nPART IV\nItem 15\nIncorporated by Reference\nExhibit\nNumber\nExhibit Description\nFiled\nHerewith\nForm\nPeriod\nEnding\nExhibit\nFiling Date\n10.5*\nMicrosoft Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan\n10-K\n6\/30\/2018\n10.5\n8\/3\/2018\n10.6*\nMicrosoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\nDEF14A\nAnnex C\n10\/16\/2017\n10.7*\nForm of Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.26\n4\/26\/2018\n10.8*\nForm of Performance Stock Award Agreement Under the Microsoft Corporation 2017 Stock Plan\n10-Q\n3\/31\/2018\n10.27\n4\/26\/2018\n10.9\nAmended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement between Microsoft Corporation and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee\n10-Q\n9\/30\/2016\n10.12\n10\/20\/2016\n10.10\nAssumption of Beneficiaries Representative Obligations Under Amended and Restated Officers Indemnification Trust Agreement\n10-K\n6\/30\/2020\n10.25\n7\/30\/2020\n10.11","710":"(In millions)\nThree Months Ending,\nSeptember 30, 2016\n$ 10,194\nDecember 31, 2016\n8,348\nMarch 31, 2017\n5,868\nJune 30, 2017\n3,058\nThereafter\n6,441\nTotal\n$ 33,909\nShare Repurchases\nOn September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems.\nWhile our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.\nWe plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company.\nIn addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the worlds largest corporate research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines. Our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation.\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING","715":"A few examples of our continued progress include:\nSigned new power purchase agreements, bringing our total portfolio of carbon-free energy to over 13.5 gigawatts.\nContracted for water replenishment projects that are estimated to provide more than 15.6 million cubic meters in volumetric water benefit over the lifetime of these projects.\nDiverted 12,159 metric tons of solid waste from landfills and incinerators across our direct operational footprint.\nProtected 12,270 acres of land in Belize - more than the 11,206 acres of land that we use around the world.\nMicrosoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data intelligence for organizations.\nAddressing Racial Injustice and Inequity\nWe are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025.\nStrengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities.\nEngaging our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new opportunities.","716":"We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million.\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (Windows OEM) revenue decreased 25%.\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\nIndustry Trends\nOur industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.","717":"We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, and customers to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions.\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located in over 200 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are a significant focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive or regulatory pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the U.S. and other countries.","718":"PART I\nItem 1A\nOur global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.","719":"Accounting Principles\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (SSP) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and\/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.","720":"$ 21,729\n$ 22,180\n$ 93,580\nGross

Share repurchase program\nIn March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2020 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company could repurchase up to $1,600,000 of the Companys common stock. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program authorization revoked the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The 2020 Share Repurchase Program did not have an expiration date but provided for suspension or discontinuation at any time. During fiscal 2020, the share repurchase program was suspended in order to strengthen liquidity and preserve cash while navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. The program resumed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2,000,000 of the Companys common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the 2020 Share Repurchase Program.

open a new Ulta Beauty store was approximately $1.7 million, which includes capital investment net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory net of payables.\nCapital expenditures during the last three years by major category are as follows:\nBudget\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n(In millions)\nNew, Remodeled, and Relocated Stores\n$\n$\n$\n$\nMerchandising and Refreshed Stores\nInformation Technology Systems\nSupply Chain\nStore Maintenance and Other\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems investments, and supply chain investments that we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures.

As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products.

In 2022, this market represented approximately $172 billion in sales, according to forecasted Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. In 2022, the beauty products industry totaled approximately $104 billion and included cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 9% share of the $104 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. In 2022, the salon services industry totaled approximately $68 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry. We have full-service hair salons in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores, as well as makeup services through our salons.

As a result, we encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by internet-based businesses, including risks related to our ability to attract and retain customers on a cost-effective basis and our ability to operate, support, expand, and develop our internet operations, website, mobile applications and software, and other related operational systems. Although we believe that our omnichannel participation is a distinct advantage for us due to synergies and the potential for new customers, supporting product offerings through these channels can create issues that have the potential to adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our e-commerce platform successfully grows, it may do so in part by attracting existing guests, rather than new guests, who choose to purchase products from us online or through our mobile applications rather than from our physical stores, thereby reducing the financial performance of our stores. In addition, offering different products through each channel could cause conflicts and cause some of our current or potential internet or mobile customers to consider competing distributors of beauty products. Offering products through our internet channel or through our mobile applications could also cause some of our current or potential vendors to consider competing internet or mobile offerings of their products either on their own or through competing distributors. Additionally, omnichannel retailing continues to rapidly evolve, and we must keep pace with changing guest expectations and new developments by our competitors.

In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","818":"Other (6)\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 20\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $10 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC decreased $4 million, mainly driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nFiscal year 2021 versus 2020\nOperating Margin increased $30 million, or 16%, which was driven primarily by the following (in millions):\nIncrease at Maritza and St. Nikola primarily driven by higher electricity prices in Bulgaria and higher generation $ 19\nImproved operational performance at Mong Duong 4\nOther 7\nTotal Eurasia SBU Operating Margin Increase $ 30\nAdjusted Operating Margin increased $20 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for NCI.\nAdjusted PTC increased $19 million driven by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin described above.\nKey Trends and Uncertainties\nDuring 2023 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses.

If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows.

Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.-Risk Factors include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court. Preliminary hearings have taken place and are ongoing.

Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years.

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.","841":"Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES holds a 75% ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development.

On December 13, 2022, the Issuers entered into the Note Purchase Agreement for the issuance of up to $647 million of 6.55% Senior Notes due in 2047. The Notes were sold on December 14, 2022, at par for $647 million. Each of the Issuers is considered a Co-Issuer and will be jointly and severally liable with each other Co-Issuer for all obligations under the facility. As a result of the issuance, AES Clean Energy Development recorded a liability of $37 million, which represents its share of the Notes issued. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate carrying amount of the Notes attributable to AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings was $37 million and is reflected within Non-recourse debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.","843":"Higher goodwill impairments in the current year;\nPrior year gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nHigher income tax expense;\nPrior year gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition date fair value;\nHigher Parent interest expense due to prior year realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, higher interest rates, and higher outstanding debt;\nLower margins at our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs, impacts of outages, and unrealized derivative losses;\nLower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; and\nOther-than-temporary impairment of sPower.\n93 | 2022 Annual Report\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nPrior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; and\nHigher margins at our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $455 million to a loss of $409 million in 2021, compared to income of $46 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to:\nLoss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nHigher asset impairments in 2021; and\nLower margins at our South America SBU primarily due to the 2020 revision of the GSF liability at Brazil.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nGain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nGain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition-date fair value;\nOther-than-temporary impairment of OPGC in 2020;\nLower Parent interest expense due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps and lower interest rates;\nLosses on extinguishment of debt at the Parent Company and DPL in 2020;","844":"Prior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nPrior year asset impairments at Buffalo Gap; and\nLower allocation of losses to tax equity partners at AES Renewable Holdings.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nHigher allocation of losses to tax equity partners and increased costs associated with growing the business at AES Clean Energy Development;\nLower earnings from AES Andes due to increased AES ownership from 67% to 99% in the first quarter of 2022;\nPrior year deferred tax benefits recorded at AES Brasil; and\nAsset impairments at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $648 million to a loss of $542 million in 2021, compared to income of $106 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to:\nLoss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nAsset impairments at Buffalo Gap;\nIncreased costs associated with growing the business at AES Clean Energy Development;\nLower earnings in Brazil due to the 2020 favorable revision of the GSF liability; and\nLower earnings in the Dominican Republic due to the sale of Itabo in the second quarter of 2021.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nAllocation of earnings at Southland Energy to noncontrolling interests;\nHigher earnings in Panama primarily due to the 2020 asset impairment and loss on extinguishment of debt; and\nHigher earnings in Colombia due to the life extension project at the Chivor hydroelectric plant completed in 2020 and better hydrology.\nNet income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation\nNet loss attributable to The AES Corporation increased $137 million, or 33%, to $546 million in 2022, compared to $409 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to:\nHigher goodwill impairments in the current year;\nPrior year gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nHigher income tax expense;","845":"Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.\nAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on\n123 | 2022 Annual Report","846":"133 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements | December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.

If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various\n74 | 2022 Annual Report","851":"Additionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted our essential operations without significant disruption. We derive approximately 85% of our total revenues from our regulated utilities and long-term sales and supply contracts or PPAs at our generation businesses, which contributes to a relatively stable revenue and cost structure at most of our businesses. In 2022, our operational locations continued to experience the impact of, and recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic. Across our global portfolio, our utilities businesses have generally performed in line with our expectations consistent with a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
