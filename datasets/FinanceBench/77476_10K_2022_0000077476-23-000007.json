    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nWhen used in this report, the terms we, us, our, PepsiCo and the Company mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report.\nCompany Overview\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\nOur Operations\nWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;\n3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;\n5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;\n6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.\nFrito-Lay North America\nEither independently or in conjunction with third parties, FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells branded convenient foods.

PBNA operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities and sells branded finished goods directly to independent distributors and retailers. PBNA also sells concentrate and finished goods for our brands to authorized and independent bottlers, who in turn sell our branded finished goods to independent distributors and retailers in certain markets. PBNA also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea and coffee products through joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks, respectively. Further, PBNA manufactures and distributes certain brands licensed from Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., including Crush, Dr Pepper and Schweppes, and certain juice brands licensed from Dole Food Company, Inc. and Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc. In 2022, PBNA began to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture, Tropicana Brands Group (TBG), operating across North America and Europe (Juice Transaction).

Further, Europe makes, markets, distributes and sells a number of dairy products including Agusha, Chudo and Domik v Derevne. Europe also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name). In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAfrica, Middle East and South Asia\nEither independently or in conjunction with third parties, AMESA makes, markets, distributes and sells a number of convenient food brands including Chipsy, Doritos, Kurkure, Lays, Sasko, Spekko and White Star, as well as many Quaker-branded convenient foods, through consolidated businesses, as well as through noncontrolled affiliates. AMESA also makes, markets, distributes and sells beverage concentrates, fountain syrups and finished goods under various beverage brands including 7UP, Aquafina, Mirinda, Mountain Dew and Pepsi. These branded products are sold to authorized and independent bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. In certain markets, however, AMESA operates its own bottling plants and distribution facilities. AMESA also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name).\nAsia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region\nEither independently or in conjunction with third parties, APAC makes, markets, distributes and sells a number of convenient food brands including BaiCaoWei, Cheetos, Doritos, Lays and Smiths, as well as many Quaker-branded convenient foods, through consolidated businesses, as well as through noncontrolled affiliates.

These branded products are sold to authorized and independent bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. APAC also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea products through an international joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name).\nOur Distribution Network\nOur products are primarily brought to market through DSD, customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices.\nDirect-Store-Delivery\nWe, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising.\nCustomer Warehouse\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover.\nDistributor Networks\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.\nE-commerce\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\nIngredients and Other Supplies\nThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice concentrates, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2022, we continued to experience increased commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, supply constraints related to the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which has continued into fiscal 2023. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.\nWe also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material\nimpact on our business or financial results. See Our Financial Results - Our Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information.\nOur Brands and Intellectual Property Rights\nWe own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewtr, Baja Blast, BaiCaoWei, Bare, Bokomo, bubly, Capn Crunch, Ceres, Cheetos, Chesters, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Driftwell, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Gatorade Fit, Gatorade Zero, Gatorlyte, Grandmas, H2oh!, Hard MTN Dew, Health Warrior, Imunele, J7, Kas, Kurkure, Lays, Life, Lifewtr, Liquifruit, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickies, Moirs, Mothers, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, MTN Dew Energy, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Near East, Off the Eaten Path, Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pearl Milling Company, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, PopCorners, Pronutro, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quaker Simply Granola, Rice-A-Roni, Rockstar Energy, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabritas, Safari, Sakata, Saladitas Gamesa, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, Sasko, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Sierra Mist Zero Sugar, Simba, Smartfood, Smiths, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonrics, Spekko, Stacys, Starry, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers, Weetbix, White Star, Ya and Yachak. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Celsius energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we began to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. We have licensed the use of the Hard MTN Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company, which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness.\nWe either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others.\nSeasonality\nOur businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results.\nOur Customers\nOur customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas.\nWe rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually.\nChanges to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sams Club (Sams), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions.\nOur Competition\nOur beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondel\u0113z International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestl\u00e9 S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc.\nMany of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2022, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 20% and 21%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States.\nOur beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes, including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy, protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or otherwise sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our environmental impact in our operations throughout our value chain.\nOur research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.\nThe U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health\nand safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act and the Clayton Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; various state and federal laws pertaining to sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level.\nWe are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chains, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates, encourage waste reduction or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize\nthe return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.\nWe are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, we are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities. Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce emissions to mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses or properties acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nIn addition to the discussion in this section, see also Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future.\nBusiness Risks\nRisks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine\nThe deadly conflict in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business.\nReduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business.\nDemand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, the use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.\nDamage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business.\nMaintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws, diversity, equity and\ninclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure, or perception of a failure, to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health or other concerns about our products, products we distribute (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nProduct recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business.\nWe have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation (or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest), particularly as we or our joint ventures continue to expand into new categories, such as the distribution of alcoholic beverages, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio.\nAny inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business.\nOur products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be\nunable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures.\nFailure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce can have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote work. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.\nWater scarcity can adversely affect our business.\nWe and our business partners use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, actions by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, can lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; increased capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business.\nChanges in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business.\nThe retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key\ncustomers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business.\nDisruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business.\nWe have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial instability of our key suppliers. Any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business.\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business partners workforce (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages (including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products), governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2022, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.\nPolitical and social conditions can adversely affect our business.\nPolitical and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand\nfor our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations or the operations of our business partners, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business.\nOur business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, the Middle East, China, South Africa, Brazil and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets.\nChanges in economic conditions can adversely impact our business.\nMany of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates, which could result in recessions or economic slowdowns; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business.\nFuture cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing\nwith customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers. In addition, these risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems.\nSimilar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information.\nAlthough the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently\nmaintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident.\nFailure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business.\nOur reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected.\nClimate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation.\nClimate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve or properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business.\nStrikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer.\nMany of our employees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production or distribution of our products are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, interrupt product supply, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business.\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance.\nA deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable\nintangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions, including the interest rate environment, or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance.\nBecause our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nTaxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Italy enacted a flat tax on all beverages, including zero calorie beverages, effective January 1, 2023, at a rate of EUR 10 cent (0.11 U.S. dollars) per liter. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nLimitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example, Brazil and Canada enacted warning labeling requirements in 2022 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nLaws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However, not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation, government action or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws, regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to recyclability and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nFailure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, as well as new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to\ncontinue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance.\nIncreases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation. For example, numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development model rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have recently agreed to implement the global minimum tax. There can be no assurance that other individual countries will adopt these changes, or that once adopted by any country, that these changes will not have adverse effects on our financial performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected.\nWe possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business.\nThe conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters and reporting (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions,\ncompliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements, including expanded disclosure requirements that are expected to continue to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters on which we are required to report. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our recent entry into the alcoholic beverage industry as a distributor, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations (or allegations thereof) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nWe have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2022 year and that remain unresolved. Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties.\nIn connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased.\nSignificant properties by division are as follows:\nProperty Type Location Owned/ Leased\nFLNA Research and development facility Plano, Texas Owned\nQFNA Convenient food plant Cedar Rapids, Iowa Owned\nPBNA Research and development facility Valhalla, New York Owned\nPBNA Concentrate plant Arlington, Texas Owned\nLatAm Convenient food plant Celaya, Mexico Owned\nLatAm Two convenient food plants Vallejo, Mexico Owned\nEurope Convenient food plant Leicester, United Kingdom Leased\nEurope Convenient food plant Kashira, Russia Owned\nEurope Manufacturing plant Lehavim, Israel Owned\nEurope Dairy plant Moscow, Russia Owned (a)\nAMESA Convenient food plant Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Owned (a)\nAPAC Convenient food plant Wuhan, China Owned (a)\nFLNA, QFNA, PBNA Shared service center Winston Salem, North Carolina Leased\nPBNA, LatAm Concentrate plant Colonia, Uruguay Owned (a)\nPBNA, Europe, AMESA Two concentrate plants Cork, Ireland Owned\nPBNA, AMESA, APAC Concentrate plant Singapore Owned (a)\nAll divisions Shared service center Hyderabad, India Leased\n(a)The land on which these properties are located is leased.\nMost of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\nAs a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine; and an evolving regulatory landscape.\nTo meet the challenges of today - and those of tomorrow - we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.\npep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework:\nPositive Agriculture: We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land, an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. In 2022, we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability, new substrates, and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving, crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world.\nPositive Value Chain: We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our SodaStream business globally, potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030. In 2022, we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by 2030. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a Time.\nPositive Choices: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food & beverage products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category; accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and offering more products with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 45 countries, and the new SodaStream Professional platform, allowing users to personalize their choices in reusable containers at home or on the go.\nWe believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.\nSee also Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces.\nOur Operations\nSee Item 1. Business for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition, research and development, regulatory matters and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas.\nOther Relationships\nCertain members of our Board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services.\nOur Business Risks\nRisks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain\nDuring 2022, we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which we expect to continue in 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions\n(including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.\nSee Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices.\nRisks Associated with Climate Change\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.\nRisks Associated with International Operations\nWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRisks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine\nIn addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia accounted for 5% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Russia accounted for 4% and 5% of our consolidated assets, including 9% and 1% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and 32% and 35% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for 0.2% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Ukraine accounted for 0.1% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.\nThe conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including impairment charges, recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflict, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\nImposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products\nCertain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.\nWe sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations.\nRetail Landscape\nOur industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-\noffline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.\nSee also Item 1A. Risk Factors, Executive Overview above and Market Risks below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges.\nRisk Management Framework\nThe achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Companys operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following:\nPepsiCos Board has oversight responsibility for PepsiCos integrated risk management framework. One of the Boards primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Companys business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Companys top risks. Throughout the year, the Board and relevant Committees of the Board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail, including risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management (including diversity, equity and inclusion) and supply chain and commodity inflation. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding the Companys top risks, including updates from members of management responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the Global Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer), governance processes associated with managing these risks, the status of projects to strengthen the Companys risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, medium- and long-term potential impacts on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and emerging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Companys risk mitigation efforts. The Board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. For example, as part of risk updates to the Board and relevant Committees during 2022, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of disruptive events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 and supply chain disruption and commodity inflation. The Board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and conditions that may impact the Companys strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization.\nThe Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.\n\u25e6The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCos risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Boards\noversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo. The Audit Committee also assists the Boards oversight of the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, who reports to the General Counsel, meets regularly with the Audit Committee, including in executive session without management present;\n\u25e6The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCos employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior;\n\u25e6The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Companys governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and\n\u25e6The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCos policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters.\nThe PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC) meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board. The PRC is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCos Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Sector Chief Executive Officers and the heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Research & Development, Information Technology, Sustainability, Strategy, Transformation, International Beverages, Commercial, Global Operations, Marketing and Financial Planning & Analysis;\nDivision and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks;\nPepsiCos Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCos Board, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board;\nPepsiCos Internal Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and\nPepsiCos Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices.\nPepsiCos Disclosure Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and heads of Internal Audit, Financial Planning & Analysis and Investor Relations, evaluates information from PepsiCos integrated risk management framework as part of the Disclosure Committees monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. PepsiCos risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure.\nMarket Risks\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\ninterest rates.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of our market risks.\nThe fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is impacted by changes in market conditions, including interest rates and inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions. See Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations.\nInflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\nCommodity Prices\nOur commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $176 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\nForeign Exchange\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Turkish lira, euro, Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and South African rand, partially offset by an appreciation of the Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments.\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $298 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.\nThe total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021.\nInterest Rates\nOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. Assuming year-end 2022 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2022 by $48 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.\nOUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nResults of Operations - Consolidated Review\nVolume\nPhysical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Beginning in 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Further, our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53rd reporting week). Unit volume growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week.\nBeverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks.\nConvenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group.\nConsolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit\n2022 2021 Change\nNet revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 9 %\nOperating profit $ 11,512 $ 11,162 3 %\nOperating margin 13.3 % 14.0 % (0.7)\nSee Results of Operations - Division Review for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue.\nOperating profit grew 3% while operating margin declined 0.7 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. The loss of net revenue due to the Juice Transaction reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points and was partially offset by a 1-percentage-point contribution from the 53rd reporting week.\nOperating profit growth also reflects a 13-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance (other impairment charges), a 12-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 6-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment on intangible assets, investment and property, plant and equipment and other charges as a result of managements decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges). These impacts were partially offset by a 29-percentage-point contribution from the gain associated with the Juice Transaction.\nThe operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of other impairment charges, the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges, partially offset by the gain associated with the Juice Transaction.\nJuice Transaction\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOther Consolidated Results\n2022 2021 Change\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 132 $ 522 $ (390)\nNet interest expense and other $ (939) $ (1,863) $ 924\nAnnual tax rate 16.1 % 21.8 %\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,910 $ 7,618 17 %\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted $ 6.42 $ 5.49 17 %\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $390 million, primarily due to higher settlement losses compared to the prior year.\nNet interest expense and other decreased $924 million, reflecting the prior-year charge of $842 million related to our cash tender offers, higher interest rates on average cash balances and lower average debt balances, partially offset by losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and higher interest rates on debt.\nThe reported tax rate decreased 5.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the impact of the Juice Transaction and adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit.\nResults of Operations - Division Review\nSee Our Business Risks, Non-GAAP Measures and Items Affecting Comparability for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\nIn the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, effective net pricing reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. Additionally, acquisitions and divestitures reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nNet Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth\nOrganic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on this measure, see Non-GAAP Measures.\nImpact of Impact of\nReported\n% Change, GAAP Measure Foreign exchange translation Acquisitions and divestitures 53rd reporting week\nOrganic\n% Change, Non-GAAP Measure(a)\nOrganic volume(b)\nEffective net pricing\nFLNA 19 % - - (2) 17 % - 17\nQFNA 15 % 0.5 - (2) 13 % (3) 16\nPBNA 4 % - 9 (2) 11 % 1 10\nLatAm 21 % - 1 - 21 % 5 16\nEurope (2) % 9 5 - 12 % (7) 19\nAMESA 6 % 12 2 - 20 % 4 16\nAPAC 4 % 5 2 - 11 % 4 6\nTotal 9 % 3 4 (1) 14 % - 14\n(a)Amounts may not sum due to rounding.\n(b)Excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and the 53rd reporting week. In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue.\nOperating Profit/(Loss), Operating Profit/(Loss) Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit/(Loss) Performance Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis\nOperating profit/(loss) adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit/(loss) performance adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, potatoes and seasoning, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a baked fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points (other impairment charges). The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.\nQFNA\nNet revenue grew 15%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and a 2-percentage-point contribution from the 53rd reporting week, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume.\nUnit volume declined 3%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit declines in oatmeal and ready-to-eat cereals and a high-single-digit decline in pancake syrups and mixes, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in rice/pasta sides and low-single-digit growth in bars.\nOperating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 37-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, the decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth.\nPBNA\nNet revenue increased 4%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. The 53rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth offset by a 9-percentage-point unfavorable impact of lower net revenue due to the Juice Transaction.\nUnit volume grew slightly, driven by a 1% increase in our NCB volume, offset by a 1% decrease in CSD volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, partially offset by a double-digit decrease in our energy portfolio.\nOperating profit increased 122%, primarily reflecting a 124-percentage-point impact of the gain of $3.0 billion associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point impact of related transaction costs. Operating profit growth was also driven by the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily aluminum and resin. A current-year gain associated with the sale of an asset and the 53rd reporting week contributed 6 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Additionally, operating profit growth was reduced by a 15-percentage-point impact of the lower net revenue due to the Juice Transaction.\nAs a result of our decision to terminate the agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to distribute Bang energy drinks, we recorded impairment and other related charges which reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points (brand portfolio impairment charges).\nLatAm\nNet revenue increased 21%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth.\nConvenient foods unit volume grew 3.5%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Brazil.\nBeverage unit volume grew 6%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Argentina. Additionally, Brazil, Guatemala, Chile and Mexico each experienced mid-single-digit growth.\nOperating profit increased 19%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 41-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, packaging materials and grains, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment and other charges associated with the sale of certain non-strategic brands reduced operating profit growth by 4.5 percentage points (brand portfolio impairment charges).\nEurope\nNet revenue decreased 2%, reflecting a 9-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, an organic volume decline and a 4.5-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the Juice Transaction, partially offset by effective net pricing.\nConvenient foods unit volume declined 4%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Russia and Ukraine and a mid-single-digit decline in Poland, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in the United Kingdom and France and mid-single-digit growth in Turkey. Additionally, the Netherlands experienced a low-single-digit decline.\nBeverage unit volume declined 7%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Russia, Ukraine and Germany, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in France. Additionally, the United Kingdom experienced a low-single-digit decline and Turkey experienced a mid-single-digit decline.\nOperating profit decreased 207%, primarily reflecting a 110-percentage-point unfavorable impact of charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a 98-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand (other impairment charges) and a 20-percentage-point unfavorable impact primarily related to the impairment of intangible assets due to the discontinuation or repositioning of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia (brand portfolio impairment charges), partially offset by a 23-percentage-point favorable impact of the gain associated with the Juice Transaction. Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 91-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, raw milk and potatoes, certain operating cost increases, the organic volume decline, a 4-percentage-point impact of less favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and a 4-percentage-point impact of payments to employees for a change in pension benefits. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points.\nAMESA\nNet revenue increased 6%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an extra month of net revenue in 2021 as we aligned Pioneer Food Group Ltd.s (Pioneer Foods) reporting calendar with that of our AMESA division. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 12 percentage points.\nConvenient foods unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in the Middle East and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in India, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in South Africa.\nBeverage unit volume grew 14%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India. Additionally, the Middle East experienced high-single-digit growth, Nigeria experienced low-single-digit growth and Pakistan experienced double-digit growth.\nOperating profit decreased 22%, primarily reflecting a 19-percentage-point impact of impairment and other charges associated with our decision to sell or discontinue certain non-strategic brands and an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges) and a 4-percentage-point impact of impairment charges primarily related to certain juice brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 74-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, grains and cooking oil, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 9 percentage points.\nAPAC\nNet revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an extra month of net revenue in 2021 as we aligned Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd.s (Be & Cheery) reporting calendar with that of our APAC division. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 5 percentage points.\nConvenient foods unit volume grew 3%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in China and Australia and mid-single-digit growth in Thailand, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Taiwan.\nBeverage unit volume grew 8%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam. Additionally, China experienced mid-single-digit growth, Thailand experienced low-single-digit growth and the Philippines experienced high-single-digit growth.\nOperating profit decreased 20%, primarily reflecting a 25-percentage-point impact of impairment charges related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also\nnegatively impacted by a 25-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and potatoes, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, prior-year impairment charges associated with an equity method investment positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage points.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nCertain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends.\nWe consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and Items Affecting Comparability for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below:\nCost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates\nThese measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges\ncomprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers, tax benefit related to the IRS audit and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see Items Affecting Comparability for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\nOrganic revenue growth\nWe define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53rd reporting week, including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\nSee Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth in Results of Operations - Division Review for further information.\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.\nSee Free Cash Flow in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability\nWe define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our\noperating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency.\nSee Return on Invested Capital in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nOur reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years:\nCost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes(a)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo\nReported, GAAP Measure $ 40,576 $ 45,816 $ 34,459 $ (3,321) $ 3,166 $ 11,512 $ 132 $ 1,727 $ 68 $ 8,910\nItems Affecting Comparability\nMark-to-market net impact (52) 52 (10) - - 62 - 14 - 48\nRestructuring and impairment charges (33) 33 (347) - - 380 31 77 1 333\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n- - (74) - - 74 6 14 - 66\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction - - - 3,321 - (3,321) - (433) - (2,888)\nImpairment and other charges (201) 201 (251) - (3,166) 3,618 - 671 - 2,947\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\n- - - - - - 307 69 - 238\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit - - - - - - - 319 - (319)\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\n- - - - - - - (86) - 86\nCore, Non-GAAP Measure $ 40,290 $ 46,102 $ 33,777 $ - $ - $ 12,325 $ 476 $ 2,372 $ 69 $ 9,421\nCost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Net interest expense and other Provision for income taxes(a)\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo\nReported, GAAP Measure $ 37,075 $ 42,399 $ 31,237 $ 11,162 $ 522 $ (1,863) $ 2,142 $ 61 $ 7,618\nItems Affecting Comparability\nMark-to-market net impact (39) 39 20 19 - - 5 - 14\nRestructuring and impairment charges (29) 29 (208) 237 10 - 41 1 205\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n(1) 1 5 (4) - - 23 - (27)\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\n- - - - 12 - 1 - 11\nCharge related to cash tender offers - - - - - 842 165 - 677\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act - - - - - - (190) - 190\nCore, Non-GAAP Measure $ 37,006 $ 42,468 $ 31,054 $ 11,414 $ 544 $ (1,021) $ 2,187 $ 62 $ 8,688\n(a)Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction.\n2022 2021 Change\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, GAAP measure $ 6.42 $ 5.49 17 %\nMark-to-market net impact 0.03 0.01\nRestructuring and impairment charges 0.24 0.15\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n0.05 (0.02)\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction (2.08) -\nImpairment and other charges 2.12 -\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\n0.17 0.01\nCharge related to cash tender offers - 0.49\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit (0.23) -\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\n0.06 0.14\nCore net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 6.79 (a)\n$ 6.26 (a)\n9 %\nImpact of foreign exchange translation 2\nGrowth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share - diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 11 %\n(a)Does not sum due to rounding.\nMark-to-Market Net Impact\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.\nRestructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful\nimplementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through December 31, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.5 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.0 billion. In our 2023 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $600 million each. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2023 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs.\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nGain Associated with the Juice Transaction\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions.\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nImpairment and Other Charges\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict Charges\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nBrand Portfolio Impairment Charges\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of managements decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOther Impairment Charges\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflect an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\nSee Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nCharge Related to Cash Tender Offers\nAs a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTax Benefit Related to the IRS Audit\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nTax Expense Related to the TCJ Act\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOur Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our Business Risks and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nOur sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our Business Risks and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material.\nThe TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 31, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2023. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act.\nAs part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCos creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of both December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.5 billion of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future.\nFurthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments.\nThe table below summarizes our cash activity:\n2022 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 10,811 $ 11,616\nNet cash used for investing activities $ (2,430) $ (3,269)\nNet cash used for financing activities $ (8,523) $ (10,780)\nOperating Activities\nIn 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.8 billion, compared to $11.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments, partially offset by favorable operating profit performance and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2022, net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.0 billion and our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion.\nIn 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion.\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our agreement with and investment in Celsius; and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions.\nWe regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.5 billion and debt redemptions/cash tender offers of $1.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.4 billion.\nIn 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion.\nSee Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations.\nWe annually review our capital structure with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023, we announced a 10.0% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see Non-GAAP Measures.\n2022 2021 Change\nNet cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 10,811 $ 11,616 (7) %\nCapital spending (5,207) (4,625)\nSales of property, plant and equipment 251 166\nFree cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 5,855 $ 7,157 (18) %\nWe use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Our Business Risks for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows.\nAny downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, Our Business Risks and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nMaterial Changes in Line Items in Our Consolidated Financial Statements\nMaterial changes in line items in our consolidated statement of income are discussed in Results of Operations - Consolidated Review, Results of Operations - Division Review and Items Affecting Comparability.\nMaterial changes in line items in our consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nMaterial changes in line items in our consolidated balance sheet are discussed below:\n2022 Change(a)\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents (b)\n$ (0.6)\nIncrease in accounts and notes receivable, net (c)\n$ 1.5\nIncrease in inventories (d)\n$ 0.9\nDecrease in assets held for sale (e)\n$ (1.8)\nIncrease in property, plant and equipment, net (f)\n$ 1.9\nDecrease in other indefinite-lived intangible assets (g)\n$ (2.8)\nIncrease in investments in noncontrolled affiliates (h)\n$ 0.7\nIncrease in other assets (i)\n$ 0.8\nDecrease in short-term debt obligations (j)\n$ (0.9)\nIncrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities (k)\n$ 2.2\nDecrease in liabilities held for sale (e)\n$ (0.8)\nDecrease in deferred income taxes (l)\n$ (0.7)\nDecrease in other liabilities (m)\n$ (0.8)\n(a)In billions.\n(b)See consolidated statement of cash flows.\n(c)Primarily reflects strong revenue performance across much of our portfolio in 2022.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are:\nrevenue recognition;\ngoodwill and other intangible assets;\nincome tax expense and accruals; and\npension and retiree medical plans.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\nOur policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\nAs discussed in Our Customers in Item 1. Business, we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with managements strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high\ninterest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Our Business Risks.\nIn 2022, we recorded $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax or $0.78 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand in Europe. As a result, its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 is equal to its fair value and the brand is at a heightened risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the SodaStream brand would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. We will continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream brand and goodwill, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.\nAn estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items.\nTax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2022, our annual tax rate was 16.1% compared to 21.8% in 2021. See Other Consolidated Results for further information.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension and Retiree Medical Plans\nOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.\nSee Items Affecting Comparability and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans.\nOur Assumptions\nThe determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:\ncertain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\nthe expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;\nthe spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;\nfor pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and\nfor retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and managements best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.\nThe health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers.\nWeighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nPension\nService cost discount rate (a)\n5.5 % 3.2 % 2.6 %\nInterest cost discount rate (a)\n5.4 % 2.9 % 1.9 %\nExpected rate of return on plan assets (a)\n7.0 % 6.3 % 6.2 %\nExpected rate of salary increases 3.3 % 3.1 % 3.1 %\nRetiree medical\nService cost discount rate 5.4 % 2.8 % 2.3 %\nInterest cost discount rate 5.3 % 2.1 % 1.6 %\nExpected rate of return on plan assets 7.1 % 5.7 % 5.4 %\nCurrent health care cost trend rate 5.5 % 5.8 % 5.5 %\n(a)2022 rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn 2022, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for certain U.S defined pension plans. In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by higher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2023.\nSensitivity of Assumptions\nA decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2023 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:\nAssumption Amount\nDiscount rates used in the calculation of expense\n$ 13\nExpected rate of return $ 38\nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits.\nWe made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make an additional $125 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nOur pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nPepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nFiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020\n(in millions except per share amounts)\n2022 2021 2020\nNet Revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 $ 70,372\nCost of sales 40,576 37,075 31,797\nGross profit 45,816 42,399 38,575\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 34,459 31,237 28,453\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction (see Note 13) (3,321) -

Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented.\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022, reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter:\nQuarter United States and Canada International\nFirst Quarter 12 weeks January, February\nSecond Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May\nThird Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August\nFourth Quarter 17 weeks September, October, November and December\nUnless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOur Divisions\nWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;\n3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;\n5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;\n6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.\nThrough our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa.\nThe accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies:\nshare-based compensation expense;\npension and retiree medical expense; and\nderivatives.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nOur divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost.\nThe allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nFLNA 13 % 13 % 13 %\nQFNA 1 % 1 % 1 %\nPBNA 20 % 19 % 18 %\nLatAm 6 % 5 % 6 %\nEurope 11 % 13 % 16 %\nAMESA 5 % 6 % 6 %\nAPAC 3 % 2 % 2 %\nCorporate unallocated expenses 41 % 41 % 38 %\nThe expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\nPension and Retiree Medical Expense\nPension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\nDerivatives\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes.\nNet Revenue and Operating Profit/(Loss)\nNet revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:\nNet Revenue Operating Profit/(Loss)\n2022 2021 2020 2022(a)\n2021 2020\nFLNA $ 23,291 $ 19,608 $ 18,189 $ 6,135 $ 5,633 $ 5,340\nQFNA 3,160 2,751 2,742 604 578 669\nPBNA (b)\n26,213 25,276 22,559 5,426 2,442 1,937\nLatAm 9,779 8,108 6,942 1,627 1,369 1,033\nEurope (b)\n12,724 13,038 11,922 (1,380) 1,292 1,353\nAMESA (c)\n6,438 6,078 4,573 666 858 600\nAPAC (c)\n4,787 4,615 3,445 537 673 590\nTotal division 86,392 79,474 70,372 13,615 12,845 11,522\nCorporate unallocated expenses - - - (2,103) (1,683) (1,442)\nTotal $ 86,392 $ 79,474 $ 70,372 $ 11,512 $ 11,162 $ 10,080\n(a)See below for impairment and other charges taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment and other impairment.\n(b)In 2022, we recorded a gain of $3,029 million and $292 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $2,888 million or $2.08 per share. See Note 13 for further information.\n(c)In 2021, the increase in net revenue in our AMESA and APAC divisions reflect our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery, respectively. See Note 13 for further information.\nDisaggregation of Net Revenue\nOur primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following table reflects the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue:\n2022 2021 2020\nBeverages(a)\nConvenient Foods Beverages(a)\nConvenient Foods Beverages(a)\nConvenient Foods\nLatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 %\nEurope 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 %\nAMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 %\nAPAC 25 % 75 % 20 % 80 % 25 % 75 %\nPepsiCo 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 %\n(a)Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022 and approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021 and 2020. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages\nImpairment and Other Charges\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\nA summary of pre-tax charges taken in 2022 in our Europe division as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is as follows:\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\nCost of sales Selling, general and administrative expenses Impairment of intangible assets(a)\nTotal\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets $ - $ - $ 1,198 $ 1,198\nImpairment charges related to property, plant and equipment 103 22 - 125\nAllowance for expected credit losses - 12 - 12\nAllowance for inventory write downs 28 1 - 29\nOther 9 42 - 51\nTotal $ 140 $ 77 $ 1,198 $ 1,415\nAfter-tax amount $ 1,124\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ (0.81)\n(a)See Note 4 for further information.

See Note 14 for further information on other assets. Investments in noncontrolled affiliates are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used.\n(b)In 2021, the increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Be & Cheery. See Note 13 for further information.\n(c)In 2021, the increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information.\nNote 2 - Our Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions.\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products\nis to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sams) represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart.\nTotal Marketplace Spending\nWe offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nThe terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $242 million as of December 31, 2022 and $262 million as of December 25, 2021 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.\nFor interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim periods actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology.\nAdvertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $5.2 billion in 2022, $5.1 billion in 2021 and $4.6 billion in 2020, including advertising expenses of $3.5 billion in both 2022 and 2021, and $3.0 billion in 2020. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of:\nmedia and personal service prepayments;\npromotional materials in inventory; and\nproduction costs of future media advertising.\nDeferred advertising costs of $40 million and $53 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet.\nDistribution Costs\nDistribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $15.0 billion in 2022, $13.7 billion in 2021 and $11.9 billion in 2020.\nSoftware Costs\nWe capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $123 million in 2022, $135 million in 2021 and $152 million in 2020. Net capitalized software and development costs were $1.1 billion and $0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $771 million, $752 million and $719 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment,\nhistorical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with managements strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results.\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Note 4 for further information.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\nBasis of Presentation - Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation.\nIncome Taxes - Note 5.\nShare-Based Compensation - Note 6.\nPension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans - Note 7.\nFinancial Instruments - Note 9.\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nInventories - Note 14. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - Note 14. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an assets estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.\nTranslation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries - Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity as currency translation adjustment.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the guidance when effective.\nNote 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nWe publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.\nThe total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:\nFLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate\nExpected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 %\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nCost of sales $ 33 $ 29 $ 30\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 347 208 239\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense 31 10 20\nTotal restructuring and impairment charges $ 411 $ 247 $ 289\nAfter-tax amount $ 334 $ 206 $ 231\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ (0.24) $ (0.15) $ (0.17)\n2022 2021 2020 Plan to Date\nthrough 12/31/2022\nFLNA $ 46 $ 28 $ 83 $ 210\nQFNA 7 - 5 19\nPBNA 68 20 47 226\nLatAm 32 37 31 171\nEurope 109 81 48 343\nAMESA 12 15 14 82\nAPAC 16 7 5 77\nCorporate 90 49 36 229\n380 237 269 1,357\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income 31 10 20 98\nTotal $ 411 $ 247 $ 289 $ 1,455\nPlan to Date\nthrough 12/31/2022\nSeverance and other employee costs $ 807\nAsset impairments 190\nOther costs 458\nTotal $ 1,455\nSeverance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

See Note 1 for further information.\nAmortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible assets estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and using average 2022 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows:\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027\nFive-year projected amortization $ 77 $ 76 $ 74 $ 67 $ 64\nDepreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $241 million ($193 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regulations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.2 billion ($958 million after-tax or $0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.\nAs discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2022, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, resulted in no impairment.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $1.6 billion ($1.3 billion after-tax or $0.94 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNAs reacquired and acquired franchise rights, as well as further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream brand and goodwill, if future sales and their contributions to operating profit do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions) or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.\nWe did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $42 million, primarily related to a coconut water brand in PBNA.\nFor further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2.\nThe change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\nBalance,\nBeginning\n2021 Acquisitions/(Divestitures) Translation\nand Other Balance,\nEnd of\n2021 Acquisitions/(Divestitures) Impairment Translation\nand Other Balance,\nEnd of\nFLNA (a)\nGoodwill $ 465 $ (8) $ 1 $ 458 $ - $ - $ (7) $ 451\nBrands 340 - - 340 - (88) (1) 251\nTotal 805 (8) 1 798 - (88) (8) 702\nQFNA\nGoodwill 189 - - 189 - - - 189\nBrands - - - - - - - -\nTotal 189 - - 189 - - - 189\nPBNA (b)\nGoodwill 12,189 (216) 1 11,974 - - (27) 11,947\nReacquired franchise rights 7,107 - - 7,107 - - (46) 7,061\nAcquired franchise rights 1,536 1 1 1,538 230 - (10) 1,758\nBrands (c)\n3,122 (290) (324) 2,508 - - - 2,508\nTotal 23,954 (505) (322) 23,127 230 - (83) 23,274\nLatAm\nGoodwill 458 - (25) 433 - - 3 436\nBrands (d)\n108 (1) (7) 100 - (29) 4 75\nTotal 566 (1) (32) 533 - (29) 7 511\nEurope (e)\nGoodwill (f)\n3,806 (28) (78) 3,700 - - (54) 3,646\nReacquired franchise rights (f)\n496 (23) (32) 441 - - (20) 421\nAcquired franchise rights (f)\n172 - (14) 158 - (1) (9) 148\nBrands (g) (h)\n4,072 - 182 4,254 - (2,684) 94 1,664\nTotal 8,546 (51) 58 8,553 - (2,685) 11 5,879\nAMESA\nGoodwill 1,096 (2) (31) 1,063 14 - (62) 1,015\nBrands (i)\n214 - (9) 205 - (36) (13) 156\nTotal 1,310 (2) (40) 1,268 14 (36) (75) 1,171\nAPAC\nGoodwill 554 3 7 564 - - (46) 518\nBrands (c) (j)\n445 - 31 476 - (172) (37) 267\nTotal 999 3 38 1,040 - (172) (83) 785\nTotal goodwill 18,757 (251) (125) 18,381 14 - (193) 18,202\nTotal reacquired franchise rights 7,603 (23) (32) 7,548 - - (66) 7,482\nTotal acquired franchise rights 1,708 1 (13) 1,696 230 (1) (19) 1,906\nTotal brands 8,301 (291) (127) 7,883 - (3,009) 47 4,921\nTotal $ 36,369 $ (564) $ (297) $ 35,508 $ 244 $ (3,010) $ (231) $ 32,511\n(a)Acquisitions/divestitures in 2021 primarily reflect purchase price allocation adjustments related to our acquisition of BFY Brands, Inc.

In 2021, we recorded $190 million ($0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit. There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $309 million in 2022, $309 million in 2021 and $78 million in 2020. We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2023.\nThe TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nOther Tax Matters\nIn 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million ($0.08 per share) in 2021.\nIn 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $233 million ($0.17 per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity.\nOn May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million ($0.05 per share) related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following:\n2022 2021\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDebt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578\nProperty, plant and equipment 2,126 2,036\nRecapture of net operating losses 492 504\nPension liabilities 189 216\nRight-of-use assets 534 450\nInvestment in TBG 186 -\nOther 232 254\nGross deferred tax liabilities 4,337 4,038\nDeferred tax assets\nNet carryforwards 5,342 4,974\nIntangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 1,614 1,111\nShare-based compensation 120 98\nRetiree medical benefits 118 147\nOther employee-related benefits 349 379\nDeductible state tax and interest benefits 144 149\nLease liabilities 534 450\nCapitalized research and development 150 -\nOther 1,050 842\nGross deferred tax assets 9,421 8,150\nValuation allowances (5,013) (4,628)\nDeferred tax assets, net 4,408 3,522\nNet deferred tax (assets)/liabilities $ (71) $ 516\nA summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 4,628 $ 4,686 $ 3,599\nProvision 492 (9) 1,082\nOther (deductions)/additions (107) (49) 5\nBalance, end of year $ 5,013 $ 4,628 $ 4,686\nReserves\nA number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows:\nJurisdiction\nYears Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit\nUnited States\n2014-2021 2014-2019\nMexico\n2014-2021 2014-2017\nUnited Kingdom\n2020-2021 None\nCanada (Domestic)\n2016-2021 2016-2019\nCanada (International)\n2010-2021 2010-2019\nRussia\n2019-2021 None\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.9 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $292 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $4 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2022. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $326 million as of December 25, 2021, of which $3 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2021.\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n2022 2021\nBalance, beginning of year $ 1,900 $ 1,621\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 228 222\nAdditions for tax positions from prior years 206 681\nReductions for tax positions from prior years (357) (558)\nSettlement payments (53) (25)\nStatutes of limitations expiration (36) (39)\nTranslation and other (21) (2)\nBalance, end of year $ 1,867 $ 1,900\nCarryforwards and Allowances\nOperating loss carryforwards totaling $32.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2023, $27.6 billion between 2024 and 2041 and $4.4 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We\nestablish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nUndistributed International Earnings\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $9 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $9 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\nNote 6 - Share-Based Compensation\nOur share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 37 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized:\n2022 2021 2020\nShare-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 343 $ 301 $ 264\nShare-based compensation expense - liability awards 30 20 11\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges 3 - -\nRestructuring charges - 1 (1)\nTotal $ 376 $ 322 $ 274\nIncome tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 62 $ 57 $ 48\nExcess tax benefits related to share-based compensation\n$ 44 $ 38 $ 35\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $396 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years.\nMethod of Accounting and Our Assumptions\nThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate\nforfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nWe do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP.\nStock Options\nA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10-year term.\nOur weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nExpected life 7 years 7 years 6 years\nRisk-free interest rate 1.9 % 1.1 % 0.9 %\nExpected volatility 16 % 14 % 14 %\nExpected dividend yield 2.5 % 3.1 % 3.4 %\nThe expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price.\nA summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nOptions(a)\nWeighted-Average Exercise\nPrice Weighted-Average Contractual\nLife Remaining\n(years) Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue(a)\nOutstanding at December 25, 2021 10,142 $ 110.54\nGranted 2,422 $ 163.54\nExercised (1,578) $ 87.33\nForfeited/expired (482) $ 146.13\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 10,504 $ 124.63 6.08 $ 588,549\nExercisable at December 31, 2022 4,892 $ 101.02 3.50 $ 389,547\nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2022 5,267 $ 144.58 8.29 $ 190,040\n(a)In thousands.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nEach RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCos performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable.\nThe fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Companys stock on the date of grant.\nA summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nRSUs/PSUs(a)\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life\nRemaining (years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue(a)\nOutstanding at December 25, 2021 5,977 $ 127.45\nGranted 2,263 $ 163.02\nConverted (2,051) $ 120.03\nForfeited (475) $ 141.64\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 (b)\n5,714 $ 143.02 1.24 $ 1,032,222\nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2022 (c)\n5,979 $ 141.94 1.17 $ 1,080,138\n(a)In thousands.

The accrued benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger.\nIn 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information.\nIn 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans.\nIn 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I, effective January 1, 2022. The accrued benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.\nIn 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The accrued benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense.\nGains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 27 years). In 2023, we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H to be approximately 11 years and the average remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I to be approximately 26 years.\nThe cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.\nSelected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows:\nPension Retiree Medical\nU.S. International\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nChange in projected benefit obligation\nObligation at beginning of year $ 16,216 $ 16,753 $ 4,175 $ 4,430 $ 954 $ 1,006\nService cost 487 518 64 104 37 33\nInterest cost 434 324 90 74 19 15\nPlan amendments 10 23 - 3 - -\nParticipant contributions - - 2 3 - -\nExperience gain (3,989) (215) (1,284) (178) (198) (17)\nBenefit payments (412) (976) (127) (106) (81) (83)\nSettlement/curtailment (1,109) (220) (5) (99) (14) -\nSpecial termination benefits 37 9 - - - -\nOther, including foreign currency adjustment (131) - (312) (56) (3) -\nObligation at end of year $ 11,543 $ 16,216 $ 2,603 $ 4,175 $ 714 $ 954\nChange in fair value of plan assets\nFair value at beginning of year $ 15,904 $ 15,465 $ 4,624 $ 4,303 $ 299 $ 315\nActual return on plan assets (3,337) 1,052 (1,026) 387 (68) 20\nEmployer contributions/funding 235 580 101 158 48 47\nParticipant contributions - - 2 3 - -\nBenefit payments (412) (976) (127) (106) (81) (83)\nSettlement (1,117) (217) (5) (52) - -\nOther, including foreign currency adjustment (125) - (374) (69) (2) -\nFair value at end of year $ 11,148 $ 15,904 $ 3,195 $ 4,624 $ 196 $ 299\nFunded status $ (395) $ (312) $ 592 $ 449 $ (518) $ (655)\nAmounts recognized\nOther assets $ 225 $ 692 $ 708 $ 564 $ - $ -\nOther current liabilities (56) (48) (7) (1) (54) (57)\nOther liabilities (564) (956) (109) (114) (464) (598)\nNet amount recognized $ (395) $ (312) $ 592 $ 449 $ (518) $ (655)\nAmounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax)\nNet loss/(gain) $ 3,337 $ 3,550 $ 571 $ 696 $ (320) $ (220)\nPrior service credit (21) (63) (9) (11) (25) (34)\nTotal $ 3,316 $ 3,487 $ 562 $ 685 $ (345) $ (254)\nChanges recognized in net (gain)/loss included in other comprehensive loss\nNet loss/(gain) arising in current year $ 254 $ (301) $ (40) $ (355) $ (114) $ (22)\nAmortization and settlement recognition (467) (265) (30) (95) 14 14\nForeign currency translation gain - - (55) (3) - -\nTotal $ (213) $ (566) $ (125) $ (453) $ (100) $ (8)\nAccumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 11,104 $ 15,489 $ 2,483 $ 4,021\nThe net loss arising in the current year is primarily attributable to a decrease in the actual return on plan assets offset by the impact of higher discount rates.\nThe amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the\nvalue of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.\nThe amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:\nInterest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.\nExpected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.\nAmortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.\nAmortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.\nSettlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted).\nSpecial termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring.\nThe components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows:\nPension Retiree Medical\nU.S. International\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nService cost $ 487 $ 518 $ 434 $ 64 $ 104 $ 86 $ 37 $ 33 $ 25\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense:\nInterest cost $ 434 $ 324 $ 435 $ 90 $ 74 $ 85 $ 19 $ 15 $ 25\nExpected return on plan assets (912) (970) (929) (218) (231) (202) (16) (15) (16)\nAmortization of prior service (credit)/cost (28) (31) 12 (1) (2) - (8) (11) (12)\nAmortization of net losses/(gains) 149 224 196 29 77 61 (14) (14) (23)\nSettlement/curtailment losses/(gains) (a)\n322 40 213 1 (11) 19 (16) - -\nSpecial termination benefits 37 9 19 - - - - - -\nTotal other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense $ 2 $ (404) $ (54) $ (99) $ (93) $ (37) $ (35) $ (25) $ (26)\nTotal $ 489 $ 114 $ 380 $ (35) $ 11 $ 49 $ 2 $ 8 $ (1)\n(a)In 2022 and 2020, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $318 million ($246 million after-tax or $0.18 per share) and $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share), respectively, related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost.\nThe following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for our pension and retiree medical plans:\nPension Retiree Medical\nU.S. International\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate (a)\n3.1 % 2.6 % 3.4 % 4.2 % 2.7 % 3.2 % 2.8 % 2.3 % 3.2 %\nInterest cost discount rate (a)\n3.1 % 2.0 % 2.9 % 2.3 % 1.7 % 2.4 % 2.1 % 1.6 % 2.6 %\nExpected return on plan assets (a)\n6.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.3 % 5.3 % 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.4 % 5.8 %\nRate of salary increases 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.3 % 3.3 %\nProjected Benefit Obligation\nDiscount rate 5.4 % 2.9 % 2.5 % 5.3 % 2.4 % 2.0 % 5.4 % 2.7 % 2.3 %\nRate of salary increases 3.2 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 4.2 % 3.3 % 3.3 %\n(a)2022 U.S. rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe following table provides selected information about plans with accumulated benefit obligation and total projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nPension Retiree Medical\nU.S. International\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nSelected information for plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nObligation for service to date $ (584) $ (1,499) $ (158) $ (127)\nFair value of plan assets $ - $ 705 $ 129 $ 102\nSelected information for plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nBenefit obligation $ (620) $ (1,709) $ (273) $ (286) $ (714) $ (954)\nFair value of plan assets $ - $ 705 $ 157 $ 171 $ 196 $ 299\nOf the total projected pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022, approximately $625 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nOur estimated future benefit payments are as follows:\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 - 2032\nPension $ 945 $ 1,070 $ 910 $ 955 $ 975 $ 5,100\nRetiree medical (a)\n$ 90 $ 85 $ 80 $ 80 $ 75 $ 330\n(a)Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act.

In addition, in 2023, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $90 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately $55 million for retiree medical benefits.\nWe also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.\nPlan Assets\nOur pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.\nFor 2023 and 2022, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.4% and 6.7%, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets for both 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\nFixed income 56 %\nU.S. equity 22 %\nInternational equity 18 %\nReal estate 4 %\nActual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a\nmethod that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility.\nPlan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2022 and 2021 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows:\nFair Value Hierarchy Level 2022 2021\nU.S. plan assets (a)\nEquity securities, including preferred stock (b)\n1 $ 4,387 $ 6,387\nGovernment securities (c)\n2 1,751 2,523\nCorporate bonds (c)\n2 4,245 6,210\nMortgage-backed securities (c)\n2 142 199\nContracts with insurance companies (d)\n3 9 9\nCash and cash equivalents (e)\n1, 2 157 352\nSub-total U.S. plan assets 10,691 15,680\nReal estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f)\n533 478\nDividends and interest receivable, net of payables\n120 45\nTotal U.S. plan assets $ 11,344 $ 16,203\nInternational plan assets\nEquity securities (b)\n1 $ 1,291 $ 2,232\nGovernment securities (c)\n2 736 1,053\nCorporate bonds (c)\n2 254 400\nFixed income commingled funds (g)\n1 628 632\nContracts with insurance companies (d)\n3 27 43\nCash and cash equivalents 1 75 34\nSub-total international plan assets 3,011 4,394\nReal estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f)\n173 221\nDividends and interest receivable 11 9\nTotal international plan assets $ 3,195 $ 4,624\n(a)Includes $196 million and $299 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries.\n(b)Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments.

The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service.\nCertain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total Company contributions were $283 million, $246 million and $225 million, respectively.\nNote 8 - Debt Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our debt obligations:\n2022(a)\n2021(a)\nShort-term debt obligations (b)\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 3,096 $ 3,872\nCommercial paper (0.1% and 0.1%)\n- 400\nOther borrowings (15.0% and 2.2%)\n318 36\n$ 3,414 $ 4,308\nLong-term debt obligations (b)\nNotes due 2022 (2.4%)\n$ - $ 3,868\nNotes due 2023 (1.7% and 1.5%)\n3,094 3,019\nNotes due 2024 (2.2% and 2.1%)\n2,867 2,986\nNotes due 2025 (2.7% and 2.7%)\n3,193 3,230\nNotes due 2026 (3.1% and 3.2%)\n2,396 2,450\nNotes due 2027 (2.5% and 2.4% )\n2,523 2,554\nNotes due 2028-2060 (2.8% and 2.6%)\n24,652 21,759\nOther, due 2022-2028 (1.3% and 1.3%)\n28 32\n38,753 39,898\nLess: current maturities of long-term debt obligations 3,096 3,872\nTotal $ 35,657 $ 36,026\n(a)Amounts are shown net of unamortized net discounts of $227 million and $233 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b)The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our international debt of $304 million and $38 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines\nof credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings.\nIn 2022, we issued the following senior notes:\nInterest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount(a)\n3.200 % July 2029 \u00a3 300 (b)\n3.550 % July 2034 \u00a3 450 (b)\n3.600 % February 2028 $ 750\n3.900 % July 2032 $ 1,250\n4.200 % July 2052 $ 500\n(a)Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.\n(b)These notes, issued in British pounds, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.\nThe net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 3.900% senior notes due 2032 that will be allocated to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in recycling and sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain, water sustainability, and regenerative agriculture, which promote our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations.\nIn 2022, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2027. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021.\nAlso in 2022, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2023. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021.\nFunds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement.\nIn 2022, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due May 2022, we paid $800 million to redeem all $800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10% senior notes due July 2022 and we paid $154 million to redeem all $133 million outstanding principal amount of our subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.s 7.00% senior notes due March 2029 and 5.50% notes due May 2035. Additionally, we deposited $102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in legal defeasance of $94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker notes). PepsiCo will be deemed to have paid and discharged the Quaker notes on April 12, 2023.\nIn 2021, we completed cash tender offers to redeem $4.1 billion principal amount of certain notes, with maturity dates ranging from May 2035 to March 2060 and interest rates ranging from 3.375% to 5.500%, for $4.8 billion in cash. As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million ($677 million after-tax or $0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers.\nAlso in 2021, we paid $750 million to redeem all $750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70% senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million.\nIn 2020, we paid $1.1 billion to redeem all $1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15% senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.8 billion.\nAlso in 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted.\nNote 9 - Financial Instruments\nDerivatives and Hedging\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\ninterest rates.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.\nOur hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instruments fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur,\nwe immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material.\nCash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item.\nCredit Risk\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moodys Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2022 was $235 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 31, 2022.\nCommodity Prices\nWe are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\nOur commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021.\nForeign Exchange\nWe are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net\ninvestment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings.\nInterest Rates\nWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.\nOur interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 1% of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 2%, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 25, 2021.\nDebt Securities\nHeld-to-Maturity\nInvestments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, we had no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. As of December 25, 2021, we had $130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 25, 2021, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material.\nAvailable-for-Sale\nInvestments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security.\nIn 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 4 for further information) and invested $550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at $75 per share,\nand the preferred shares are entitled to a 5% annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment as of December 31, 2022. There were no impairment charges related to our investment in the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are categorized as follows:\n2022 2021\nFair Value Hierarchy Levels(a)\nAssets(a)\nLiabilities(a)\nAssets(a)\nLiabilities(a)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities (b)\n2 $ 660 $ - $ - $ -\nIndex funds (c)\n1 $ 257 $ - $ 337 $ -\nPrepaid forward contracts (d)\n2 $ 14 $ - $ 21 $ -\nDeferred compensation (e)\n2 $ - $ 434 $ - $ 505\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange (f)\n2 $ 24 $ 22 $ 29 $ 14\nInterest rate (f)\n2 - 164 14 264\nCommodity (g)\n2 2 60 70 5\n$ 26 $ 246 $ 113 $ 283\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange (f)\n2 $ 21 $ 21 $ 19 $ 7\nCommodity (g)\n2 11 51 35 22\n$ 32 $ 72 $ 54 $ 29\nTotal derivatives at fair value (h)\n$ 58 $ 318 $ 167 $ 312\nTotal $ 989 $ 752 $ 525 $ 817\n(a)Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.\n(b)Primarily related to our investment in Celsius convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. As of December 31, 2022, $3 million, $104 million and $553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively.\n(c)Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.\n(d)Based primarily on the price of our common stock.\n(e)Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees investment elections.\n(f)Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.\n(g)Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.\n(h)Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.\nThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 was $35 billion and $43 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.\nLosses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows:\nFair Value/Non-\ndesignated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges\nLosses/(Gains)\nRecognized in\nIncome Statement(a)\nLosses/(Gains)\nRecognized in\nAccumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains)\nReclassified from\nAccumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss\ninto Income\nStatement(b)\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nForeign exchange $ (58) $ (4) $ (3) $ (7) $ (21) $ 82\nInterest - 56 138 44 159 64\nCommodity (179) (218) (57) (285) (267) (194)\nNet investment - - (120) (192) - -\nTotal $ (237) $ (166) $ (42) $ (440) $ (129) $ (48)\n(a)Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative gains included in cost of sales totaled $8 million in 2022 and $109 million in 2021 and commodity derivative gains included in selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $171 million in 2022 and $109 million in 2021.\n(b)Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in net revenue and cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. See Note 11 for further information.\nBased on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $51 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity into net income during the next 12 months.\nNote 10 - Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share\nThe computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nIncome Shares(a)\nIncome Shares(a)\nIncome Shares(a)\nBasic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\n$ 6.45 $ 5.51 $ 5.14\nNet income available for PepsiCo common shareholders\n$ 8,910 1,380 $ 7,618 1,382 $ 7,120 1,385\nDilutive securities:\nStock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (b)\n- 7 - 7 - 7\nDiluted\n$ 8,910 1,387 $ 7,618 1,389 $ 7,120 1,392\nDiluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\n$ 6.42 $ 5.49 $ 5.12\n(a)Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).\n(b)The dilutive effect of these securities is calculated using the treasury stock method.\nThe weighted-average amount of antidilutive securities excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020.\nNote 11 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Attributable to PepsiCo\nThe changes in the balances of each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to PepsiCo are as follows:\nCurrency Translation Adjustment Cash Flow Hedges Pension and Retiree Medical Other(a)\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Attributable to PepsiCo\nBalance as of December 28, 2019 (b)\n$ (11,290) $ (3) $ (2,988) $ (19) $ (14,300)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) before reclassifications (c)\n(710) 126 (1,141) (1) (1,726)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss - (116) 465 - 349\nNet other comprehensive income/(loss) (710) 10 (676) (1) (1,377)\nTax amounts 60 (3) 144 - 201\nBalance as of December 26, 2020 (b)\n(11,940) 4 (3,520) (20) (15,476)\nOther comprehensive (loss)/income before reclassifications (d)\n(340) 248 702 22 632\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss 18 (48) 299 - 269\nNet other comprehensive (loss)/income (322) 200 1,001 22 901\nTax amounts (47) (45) (231) - (323)\nBalance as of December 25, 2021 (b)\n(12,309) 159 (2,750) 2 (14,898)\nOther comprehensive (loss)/income before reclassifications (e)\n(603) (78) 48 8 (625)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss - (129) 440 - 311\nNet other comprehensive (loss)/income (603) Ye (207) 488 8 (314)\nTax amounts (36) 49 (99) (4) (90)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 (b)\n$ (12,948) $ 1 $ (2,361) $ 6 $ (15,302)\n(a)The change in 2021 primarily comprises fair value increases in available-for-sale securities.\n(b)Pension and retiree medical amounts are net of taxes of $1,370 million as of December 28, 2019, $1,514 million as of December 26, 2020, $1,283 million as of December 25, 2021 and $1,184 million as of December 31, 2022.\n(c)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Russian ruble and Mexican peso.\n(d)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Turkish lira, Swiss franc and Mexican peso.\n(e)Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Egyptian pound and British pound sterling.\nThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the income statement:\nAmount Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Affected Line Item in the Income Statement\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrency translation:\nDivestitures $ - $ 18 $ - Selling, general and administrative expenses\nCash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ (11) $ 6 $ - Net revenue\nForeign exchange contracts (10) 76 (43) Cost of sales\nInterest rate derivatives 159 64 (129) Selling, general and administrative expenses\nCommodity contracts (252) (190) 50 Cost of sales\nCommodity contracts (15) (4) 6 Selling, general and administrative expenses\nNet gains before tax (129) (48) (116)\nTax amounts 23 11 29\nNet (gains) after tax $ (106) $ (37) $ (87)\nPension and retiree medical items:\nAmortization of net prior service credit $ (37) $ (44) $ - Other pension and retiree medical benefits income\nAmortization of net losses 164 289 238 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income\nSettlement/curtailment losses 313 54 227 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income\nNet losses before tax 440 299 465\nTax amounts (80) (65) (101)\nNet losses after tax $ 360 $ 234 $ 364\nTotal net losses reclassified for the year, net of tax $ 254 $ 215 $ 277\nNote 12 - Leases\nLessee\nWe determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nWe have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).\nComponents of lease cost are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost (a)\n$ 585 $ 563 $ 539\nVariable lease cost (b)\n$ 115 $ 112 $ 111\nShort-term lease cost (c)\n$ 510 $ 469 $ 436\n(a)Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $517 million, $505 million, and $478 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n(b)Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax.\n(c)Not recorded on our balance sheet.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized gains of $175 million, $42 million and $7 million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under five years.\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating cash flow information:\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\n$ 573 $ 567 $ 555\nNon-cash activity:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations\n$ 871 $ 934 $ 621\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows:\nBalance Sheet Classification 2022 2021\nRight-of-use assets\nOther assets $ 2,373 $ 2,020\nCurrent lease liabilities\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities $ 483 $ 446\nNon-current lease liabilities\nOther liabilities $ 1,933 $ 1,598\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 7 years 7 years 6 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 3 % 3 % 4 %\nMaturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows:\n2023 $ 541\n2024 465\n2025 386\n2026 326\n2027 266\n2028 and beyond 718\nTotal lease payments 2,702\nLess: Imputed interest 286\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,416\nLessor\nWe have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\nNote 13 - Acquisitions and Divestitures\nJuice Transaction\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBGs earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).\nAs a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including $520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement.\nA summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nPBNA Europe Corporate Total PepsiCo Provision for income taxes(a)\nNet income attributable to PepsiCo Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction $ (3,029) $ (292) $ - $ (3,321) $ 433 $ (2,888) $ 2.08\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges 51 14 6 71 (13) 58 (0.04)\nOperating profit $ (2,978) $ (278) $ 6 (3,250) 420 (2,830) 2.04\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income (b)\n(10) 3 (7) 0.01\nTotal Juice Transaction $ (3,260) $ 423 $ (2,837) $ 2.04 (c)\n(a) Includes $186 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in TBG.\n(b) Includes $16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $6 million special termination benefits.\n(c) Does not sum due to rounding.\nIn connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to TBG to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, TBG is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup.\nAs of December 25, 2021, $1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of $0.5 billion, and liabilities of $0.8 billion, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities of $0.6 billion and deferred income taxes of $0.2 billion, related to the Juice Transaction were reclassified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. The Juice Transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts classified as held for sale.\n2020 Acquisitions\nOn March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.5 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date.\nOn April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments due under the contingent consideration arrangement.\nOn June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $0.7 billion.\nWe accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates is summarized as follows:\nPioneer Foods Rockstar Be & Cheery\nAcquisition date March 23, 2020 April 24, 2020 June 1, 2020\nInventories $ 229 $ 52 $ 45\nProperty, plant and equipment 379 8 60\nAmortizable intangible assets 52 - 98\nNonamortizable intangible assets 183 2,400 309\nOther assets and liabilities (53) (9) (24)\nNet deferred income taxes (117) - (99)\nNoncontrolling interest (5) - -\nTotal identifiable net assets 668 2,451 389\nGoodwill 558 2,278 309\nTotal purchase price $ 1,226 $ 4,729 $ 698\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized.\nThe goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Foods primarily reflects synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the AMESA division.\nThe goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCos expected new innovation in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA division.\nThe goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Be & Cheery primarily reflects growth opportunities for PepsiCo as we leverage Be & Cheerys direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the APAC division.\nAcquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\nA summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows:\n2022 2021 2020\nCost of sales $ - $ 1 $ 32\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (a)\n74 (5) 223\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense 6 - -\nTotal $ 80 $ (4) $ 255\nAfter-tax amount (b)\n$ 66 $ (27) $ 237\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ (0.05) $ 0.02 $ (0.17)\n(a)The income amount primarily relates to the acceleration payment made in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the contingent consideration arrangement associated with our acquisition of Rockstar, which is partially offset by other acquisition and divestiture-related charges.\n(b)In 2021, includes a tax benefit related to contributions to socioeconomic programs in South Africa.\n2022 2021 2020 Transaction\nFLNA $ - $ 2 $ 29 BFY Brands\nPBNA 51 11 66 Juice Transaction, Rockstar\nEurope 14 8 - Juice Transaction\nAMESA 3 10 173 Pioneer Foods, Other\nAPAC - 4 7 Be & Cheery\nCorporate (a)\n6 (39) (20) Juice Transaction, Rockstar\nTotal 74 (4) 255\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits expense 6 - - Juice Transaction\nTotal acquisition and divestiture-related charges $ 80 $ (4) $ 255\n(a)In 2021, the income amount primarily relates to the acceleration payment made in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the contingent consideration arrangement associated with our acquisition of Rockstar, which is partially offset by divestiture-related charges associated with the Juice Transaction.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSales incentive accruals\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the Accounts payable and other current liabilities line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Companys sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,\nbased on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Companys ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.\nCarrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and SodaStream brand\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 was $32.5 billion which represents 35% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North Americas (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nWe identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNAs reacquired and acquired franchise rights and the SodaStream brand in Europe as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Companys forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Companys conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Companys ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Companys historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authoritys settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of\nthe reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years tax returns in light of new information.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authoritys settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Companys tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Companys interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1990.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 8, 2023\nGLOSSARY\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\nBottler Case Sales (BCS): measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\nBottler funding: financial incentives we give to our independent bottlers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our beverage products.\nConcentrate Shipments and Equivalents (CSE): measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\nConstant currency: financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period.

Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2022, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year\nproductivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nExcept with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. Item 9B.
