Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions\nBasis of Presentation\nWhen used in this report, the terms we, us, our, PepsiCo and the Company mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2022 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year.\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nWhile our financial results in the United States and Canada (North America) are reported on a 12-week basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of January and February are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022.\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates.\nOur significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate.\nUnless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.\nOur Divisions\nWe are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows:\n1)Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada;\n2)Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada;\n3)PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada;\n4)Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America;\n5)Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe;\n6)Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and\n7)Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.\nNet revenue of each division is as follows:\n12 Weeks Ended\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nFLNA $ 5,583 $ 4,839\nQFNA 777 713\nPBNA 5,798 5,353\nLatAm 1,777 1,474\nEurope 1,886 1,797\nAMESA 1,019 1,004\nAPAC 1,006 1,020\nTotal $ 17,846 $ 16,200\nOur primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue:\n12 Weeks Ended\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nBeverages(a)\nConvenient Foods Beverages(a)\nConvenient Foods\nLatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 %\nEurope 45 % 55 % 50 % 50 %\nAMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 %\nAPAC 15 % 85 % 15 % 85 %\nPepsiCo 40 % 60 % 40 % 60 %\n(a)Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35% of our consolidated net revenue in each of the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue but lower operating margin as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages.\nOperating profit of each division is as follows:\n12 Weeks Ended\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nFLNA $ 1,599 $ 1,296\nQFNA 188 159\nPBNA (a)\n483 3,434\nLatAm\n364 323\nEurope (a) (b)\n71 (136)\nAMESA 168 180\nAPAC 227 215\nTotal divisions 3,100 5,471\nCorporate unallocated expenses (471) (204)\nTotal $ 2,629 $ 5,267\n(a)In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a gain of $3,024 million and $298 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $2,870 million or $2.06 per share. See Note 12 for further information.\n(b)In the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recognized impairment and other charges/credits as follows:\n(1)Pre-tax charges of $241 million ($241 million after-tax or $0.17 per share), as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including impairment related to property, plant and equipment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write downs and other charges, with $140 million recorded in cost of sales, $100 million recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and $1 million recorded in impairment of intangible assets.\n(2)Pre-tax brand portfolio impairment charges of $241 million ($193 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets related to the repositioning or discontinuation of certain juice and dairy brands in Russia. See Note 4 for further information. For information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nNote 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in fiscal year 2024 with early adoption permitted. We currently plan to adopt the rollforward guidance when effective. See Note 13 for disclosures currently required under this guidance.\nNote 3 - Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\nWe publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 35% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.\nThe total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:\nFLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate\nExpected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 %\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows:\n12 Weeks Ended\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nCost of sales $ 3 $ 5\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 110 22\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits income (a)\n(1) -\nTotal restructuring and impairment charges $ 112 $ 27\nAfter-tax amount $ 98 $ 21\nImpact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ (0.07) $ (0.02)\n12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022 through 3/25/2023\nFLNA $ 7 $ 3 $ 217\nQFNA - - 19\nPBNA 5 3 231\nLatAm 5 6 176\nEurope 89 7 432\nAMESA 5 2 87\nAPAC 1 1 78\nCorporate 1 5 230\n113 27 1,470\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense (a)\n(1) - 97\nTotal $ 112 $ 27 $ 1,567\n(a)Income amount represents adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts.\n12 Weeks Ended Plan to Date\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022 through 3/25/2023\nSeverance and other employee costs $ 92 $ 11 $ 899\nAsset impairments - - 190\nOther costs 20 16 478\nTotal $ 112 $ 27 $ 1,567\nSeverance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees.\nA summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 is as follows:\nSeverance and Other Employee Costs Other Costs Total\nLiability as of December 31, 2022 $ 188 $ 8 $ 196\n2023 restructuring charges\n92 20 112\nCash payments (44) (20) (64)\nNon-cash charges and translation (4) - (4)\nLiability as of March 25, 2023 $ 232 $ 8 $ 240\nSubstantially all of the restructuring accrual at March 25, 2023 is expected to be paid by the end of 2023.\nOther Productivity Initiatives\nThere were no charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan.\nWe regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 for impairment and other charges/credits taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and brand portfolio impairment charges.\nNote 4 - Intangible Assets\nDuring the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we repositioned or discontinued certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $241 million ($193 million after-tax or $0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets. See Note 1 for further information.\nFor further information on indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nA summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows:\n3/25/2023 12/31/2022\nGross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net\nAcquired franchise rights\n$ 833 $ (202) $ 631 $ 837 $ (200) $ 637\nCustomer relationships 563 (240) 323 571 (237) 334\nBrands\n1,085 (969) 116 1,097 (973) 124\nOther identifiable intangibles 445 (265) 180 447 (265) 182\nTotal $ 2,926 $ (1,676) $ 1,250 $ 2,952 $ (1,675) $ 1,277\nThe change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\nBalance\n12/31/2022\nTranslation\nand Other Balance\n3/25/2023\nFLNA\nGoodwill $ 451 $ (2) $ 449\nBrands 251 - 251\nTotal 702 (2) 700\nQFNA\nGoodwill 189 - 189\nTotal 189 - 189\nPBNA\nGoodwill 11,947 (7) 11,940\nReacquired franchise rights 7,061 (12) 7,049\nAcquired franchise rights 1,758 (2) 1,756\nBrands 2,508 1 2,509\nTotal 23,274 (20) 23,254\nLatAm\nGoodwill 436 7 443\nBrands 75 2 77\nTotal 511 9 520\nEurope\nGoodwill 3,646 (56) 3,590\nReacquired franchise rights 421 (8) 413\nAcquired franchise rights 148 (1) 147\nBrands 1,664 (1) 1,663\nTotal 5,879 (66) 5,813\nAMESA\nGoodwill 1,015 (52) 963\nBrands 156 (13) 143\nTotal 1,171 (65) 1,106\nAPAC\nGoodwill 518 (3) 515\nBrands\n267 (2) 265\nTotal 785 (5) 780\nTotal goodwill 18,202 (113) 18,089\nTotal reacquired franchise rights 7,482 (20) 7,462\nTotal acquired franchise rights 1,906 (3) 1,903\nTotal brands 4,921 (13) 4,908\nTotal $ 32,511 $ (149) $ 32,362\nNote 5 - Income Taxes\nIn 2021, we received a final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. In 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we adjusted our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act). Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information. There were no tax amounts recognized in the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 and March 19, 2022 from this agreement.\nNote 6 - Share-Based Compensation\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses:\n12 Weeks Ended\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nShare-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 93 $ 81\nShare-based compensation expense - liability awards 6 5\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges - 3\nRestructuring charges 1 (1)\nTotal $ 100 $ 88\nThe following table summarizes share-based awards granted under the terms of the PepsiCo, Inc.

We expect to make an additional discretionary contribution of $125 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in the third quarter of 2023.\nNote 8 - Debt Obligations\nIn the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, we issued the following notes:\nInterest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount(a)\nFloating rate February 2026 $ 350\n4.550 % February 2026 $ 500\n4.450 % May 2028 $ 650\n4.450 % February 2033 $ 1,000\n4.650 % February 2053 $ 500\n(a)Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums.\nThe net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper.\nIn the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023, $1.3 billion of USD-denominated senior notes matured and were paid. Subsequent to March 25, 2023, we discharged via legal defeasance $94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company, following the deposit of $102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAs of March 25, 2023, we had $800 million of commercial paper outstanding, excluding discounts.\nNote 9 - Financial Instruments\nWe are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in:\ncommodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy;\nforeign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and\ninterest rates.\nThere have been no material changes during the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023 with respect to our risk management policies or strategies and valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moodys Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of March 25, 2023 was $228 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of March 25, 2023.\nThe notional amounts of our financial instruments used to hedge the above risks as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are as follows:\nNotional Amounts(a)\n3/25/2023 12/31/2022\nCommodity $ 1.8 $ 1.8\nForeign exchange $ 2.8 $ 3.0\nInterest rate $ 1.3 $ 1.3\nNet investment (b)\n$ 2.9 $ 2.9\n(a)In billions.\n(b)The total notional of our net investment hedge consists of non-derivative debt instruments.\nAs of March 25, 2023, approximately 4% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to 1% as of December 31, 2022.\nDebt Securities\nAvailable-for-Sale\nInvestments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investments as of March 25, 2023. There were no impairment charges related to our investments for the 12 weeks ended March 25, 2023.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are categorized as follows:\n3/25/2023 12/31/2022\nFair Value Hierarchy Levels(a)\nAssets(a)\nLiabilities(a)\nAssets(a)\nLiabilities(a)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities (b)\n2 $ 658 $ - $ 660 $ -\nIndex funds (c)\n1 $ 250 $ - $ 257 $ -\nPrepaid forward contracts (d)\n2 $ 14 $ - $ 14 $ -\nDeferred compensation (e)\n2 $ - $ 432 $ - $ 434\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange (f)\n2 $ 23 $ 34 $ 24 $ 22\nInterest rate (f)\n2 - 175 - 164\nCommodity (g)\n2 2 50 2 60\n$ 25 $ 259 $ 26 $ 246\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange (f)\n2 $ 17 $ 17 $ 21 $ 21\nCommodity (g)\n2 9 45 11 51\n$ 26 $ 62 $ 32 $ 72\nTotal derivatives at fair value (h)\n$ 51 $ 321 $ 58 $ 318\nTotal $ 973 $ 753 $ 989 $ 752\n(a)Fair value hierarchy levels are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) and Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) in both years. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.\n(b)Primarily related to our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. convertible preferred stock. The fair value of our investment approximates the transaction price and any accrued dividends, as well as the amortized cost. As of March 25, 2023, $99 million and $559 million were classified as short-term investments and other assets, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, $3 million, $104 million and $553 million were classified as cash equivalents, short-term investments and other assets, respectively.\n(c)Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability.\n(d)Based primarily on the price of our common stock.\n(e)Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees investment elections.\n(f)Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates.\n(g)Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements.\n(h)Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on our balance sheet as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table.\nThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $39 billion and $35 billion, respectively, based upon prices of identical or similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.\nLosses/(gains) on our cash flow and net investment hedges are categorized as follows:\n12 Weeks Ended\nLosses/(Gains)\nRecognized in\nAccumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains)\nReclassified from\nAccumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss\ninto Income Statement(a)\n3/25/2023 3/19/2022 3/25/2023 3/19/2022\nForeign exchange\n$ 16 $ (8) $ 1 $ (4)\nInterest rate 11 (3) 3 20\nCommodity 65 (189) 9 (78)\nNet investment 37 (51) - -\nTotal $ 129 $ (251) $ 13 $ (62)\n(a)Foreign exchange derivative losses/(gains) are included in net revenue and cost of sales.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\nJuice Transaction\nIn the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for $3.5 billion in cash and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBGs portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBGs earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses).\nAs a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax or $2.08 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions, including $520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39% ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flows and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in our 2022 Form 10-K for further information.\nIn the 12 weeks ended March 19, 2022, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.3 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax or $2.06 per share) in our PBNA and Europe divisions.\nAcquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures.

Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCos creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of March 25, 2023 and December 31, 2022, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable are to suppliers participating in these financing arrangements.\nItem 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nOur discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition and is provided as an addition to, and should be read in connection with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are presented in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common stock per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Percentage changes are based on unrounded amounts.\nOur Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe critical accounting policies and estimates below should be read in conjunction with those outlined in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nTotal Marketplace Spending\nWe offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled.\nThese accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nFor interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim periods actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our quarterly provision for income taxes, we use an estimated annual effective tax rate which is based on our expected annual income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Subsequent recognition, derecognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a previous period are separately recognized in the quarter in which they occur.\nOur Business Risks\nThis Form 10-Q contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as aim, anticipate, believe, drive, estimate, expect, expressed confidence, forecast, future, goal, guidance, intend, may, objective, outlook, plan, position, potential, project, seek, should, strategy, target, will or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited\nto: the risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine; future demand for PepsiCos products; damage to PepsiCos reputation or brand image; product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety; PepsiCos ability to compete effectively; PepsiCos ability to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce; water scarcity; changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer; disruption of PepsiCos manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs; political or social conditions in the markets where PepsiCos products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; PepsiCos ability to grow its business in developing and emerging markets; changes in economic conditions in the countries in which PepsiCo operates; future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems; failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions; PepsiCos reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems; climate change or measures to address climate change; strikes or work stoppages; failure to realize benefits from PepsiCos productivity initiatives; deterioration in estimates and underlying assumptions regarding future performance that can result in an impairment charge; fluctuations or other changes in exchange rates; any downgrade or potential downgrade of PepsiCos credit ratings; imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at PepsiCos products; imposition of limitations on the marketing or sale of PepsiCos products; changes in laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials; failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws; increase in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities; failure to adequately protect PepsiCos intellectual property rights or infringement on intellectual property rights of others; failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations; and potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations; and other risks and uncertainties including those described in ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere have been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K.  ITEM 2.
