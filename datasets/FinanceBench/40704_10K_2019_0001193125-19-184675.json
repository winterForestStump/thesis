    "content": "ITEM 1 Business\nGeneral Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms General Mills, Company, registrant, we, us, and our mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise.\nCertain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018, we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our consolidated operations, we have 50 percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide.\nWe continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms, which are H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures. We believe executing against this growth framework should result in long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nAs part of our portfolio shaping strategy, in fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our Pet operating segment on a one-month lag. In fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings did not include Pet operating segment results. For further information on the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nWe manage and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments.\nWe offer a variety of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories:\nsnacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;\nready-to-eat cereal;\nconvenient meals, including meal kits, ethnic meals, pizza, soup, side dish mixes, frozen breakfast, and frozen entrees;\nyogurt;\npet food;\nsuper-premium ice cream;\nbaking mixes and ingredients; and\nrefrigerated and frozen dough.\nOur Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestl\u00e9 S.A. (Nestl\u00e9) competes in the ready-to-eat cereal category in markets outside North America, and our H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nCustomers. Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, e-commerce retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2019, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers, please refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nCompetition. The packaged foods categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers needs, an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging. The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides\nus efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nOur research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, and exploratory research in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $222 million in fiscal 2019 and $219 million in fiscal 2018.\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nOur products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our global operations (set forth in italics in this report) include Annies, Betty Crocker, Bisquick, Blue Buffalo, BLUE Basics, BLUE Freedom, BLUE Wilderness, Bugles, Cascadian Farm, Cheerios, Chex, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Cocoa Puffs, Cookie Crisp, EPIC, Fiber One, Food Should Taste Good, Fruit by the Foot, Fruit Gushers, Fruit Roll-Ups, Gardettos, Go-Gurt, Gold Medal, Golden Grahams, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Helpers, Jenos, Jus-Rol, Kitano, Kix, L\u00e4rabar, Latina, Libert\u00e9, Lucky Charms, Muir Glen, Nature Valley, Oatmeal Crisp, Old El Paso, Pillsbury, Progresso, Raisin Nut Bran, Total, Totinos, Trix, Wanchai Ferry, Wheaties, Yoki, and Yoplait. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.\nSome of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing products (e.g., Reeses Puffs for cereal, Green Giant for vegetables in certain countries, and Cinnabon for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under various third party equities).\nOur cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the Nestl\u00e9 trademark. Nestl\u00e9 licenses certain of its trademarks to CPW, including the Nestl\u00e9 and Uncle Tobys trademarks. The H\u00e4agen-Dazs trademark is licensed royalty-free and exclusively to Nestl\u00e9 for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada. The H\u00e4agen-Dazs trademark is also licensed to HDJ. The Pillsbury brand and the Pillsbury Doughboy character are subject to an exclusive, royalty-free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada and Mexico.\nThe Yoplait trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest. These marks are licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a 51 percent interest. Yoplait SAS licenses these trademarks to its franchisees. The Libert\u00e9 trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl, an entity in which we own a 50 percent interest.\nWe continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.\nSEASONALITY\nIn general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough, frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for Progresso soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, within\nour Europe & Australia and Asia & Latin America segments, demand for H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream is higher during the summer months and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our international segments net sales are generally evenly balanced throughout the year.\nBACKLOG\nOrders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as of May 26, 2019, was not material.\nWORKING CAPITAL\nA description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had approximately 40,000 full- and part-time employees.\nQUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION\nThe manufacture and sale of consumer and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the United States.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nAs of May 26, 2019, we were involved with two active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey.\nOur operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nBased on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe section below provides information regarding our executive officers as of June 27, 2019:\nRichard C.

Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on\nproduct innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.\nWe may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.\nThere has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019, Walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 31 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. PetSmart and Petco accounted for 36 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our Pet segments net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nPrice changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability.\nThe principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.\nWe utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments.\nIf we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more\ndifficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDisruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. Our suppliers policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain food products or ingredients.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.\nWe may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories.\nThe food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted.\nOur international operations are subject to political and economic risks.\nIn fiscal 2019, 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:\npolitical and economic instability;\nexchange controls and currency exchange rates;\ntariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;\nnationalization of operations;\ncompliance with anti-corruption regulations;\nuncertainty relating to the United Kingdoms planned exit from the European Union;\nforeign tax treaties and policies; and\nrestriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.\nNew regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.\nOur facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $15.4 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:\nability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and\nflexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.\nGlobal capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nWe depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.\nFrom time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.\nInformation technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had $20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totinos, Progresso, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Yoki, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and Annies brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our Pillsbury, Yoki, and Progresso brands have experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. We had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage Blue Buffalo successfully following the acquisition.\nThe integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the integration of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include:\ndiversion of managements attention to integration matters;\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from the acquisition;\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\ndifficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures, and accounting and other policies, business cultures, and compensation structures;\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees;\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\ndifficulties in building and operating new and existing manufacturing facilities;\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;\nthe impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and\ncoordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of managements time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully, the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot be assured that the Blue Buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits.\nBlue Buffalo may underperform relative to our expectations.\nThe business, prospects, and financial performance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Blue Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. When we acquired Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2018, we recorded significant brand intangible and goodwill assets at fair value based on, among other things, our projections of Blue Buffalos financial performance. Our failure to meet or exceed our projections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including a material impairment to our intangible assets.\nOur failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets. ITEM 1B Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. ITEM 2 Properties\nWe own our principal executive offices and main research facilities, which are located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metropolitan area.

ITEM 3 Legal Proceedings\nWe are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. All such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. In our opinion, there were no claims or litigation pending as of May 26, 2019, that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See the information contained under the section entitled Environmental Matters in Item 1 of this report for a discussion of environmental matters in which we are involved.

We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe.\nOur fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and cash return to shareholders are key drivers of financial performance for our business.\nOur long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver:\nlow single-digit annual growth in organic net sales;\nmid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;\nhigh single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS;\nfree cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and\ncash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.\nWe continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent in-store execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms, which are H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, Old El Paso Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. By focusing on this growth framework, we expect to generate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should result in long-term value creation for our shareholders.\nIn fiscal 2019 we executed well and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets, including organic net sales growth and constant-currency growth in net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS. Relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in U.S. Yogurt and our emerging market businesses, we increased our contributions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the U.S., and we generated greater benefits from net price realization and mix through our Strategic Revenue Management capability. These results were partially offset by challenging performance for U.S. snack bars, leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets.\nWe successfully transitioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales and segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion.\nOur consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7 percent to $16.9 billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. Operating profit of $2.5 billion increased 4 percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent and increased 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20 percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4 percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).\nNet cash provided by operations totaled $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of 157 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3 billion at a conversion rate of 115 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2 billion and reduced total debt outstanding by $1.3 billion.\nA detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 appears below in the section titled Fiscal 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations. A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance compared to our fiscal 2017 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018 under the caption Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Fiscal 2018 Results of Consolidated Operations.\nIn fiscal 2020, our plans include continued strong innovation and investments in capabilities and brand building to accelerate our topline growth, efficiency initiatives to maintain our strong margins, and a disciplined focus on cash to further reduce our leverage. We remain confident that executing our Consumer First strategy and our Compete, Accelerate, and Reshape growth framework will drive sustainable, profitable growth and attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.\nOur key full-year fiscal 2020 targets are summarized below:\nOrganic net sales are expected to increase 1 to 2 percent.\nConstant-currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2 to 4 percent from the base of $2.8 billion reported in fiscal 2019. Benefit of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 will be reinvested in capabilities and brand-building initiatives to drive improvement in our organic net sales growth rate in 2020 and beyond.\nConstant-currency adjusted diluted EPS are expected to increase 3 to 5 percent from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019.\nFree cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 95 percent of adjusted after-tax earnings.\nSee the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP.\nCertain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report.\nFISCAL 2019 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nIn fiscal 2019, net sales increased 7 percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May 26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9 percent was down 50 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9 percent, primarily driven by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20 percent primarily driven by a one-time benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4 percent on a constant-currency basis (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2019 follows:\nFiscal 2019\nIn millions, except\nper share\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nPercent of Net\nSales\nConstant-\nCurrency\nGrowth (a)\nNet sales\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n9 %\nOperating profit\n2,515.9\n4 %\n14.9 %\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n1,752.7\n(18) %\nDiluted EPS\n$ 2.90\n(20) %\nOrganic net sales growth rate (a)\nFlat\nAdjusted operating profit (a)\n2,858.0\n9 %\n16.9 %\n10 %\nAdjusted diluted EPS (a)\n$ 3.22\n4 %\n4 %\n(a) See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP.\nConsolidated net sales were as follows:\nFiscal 2019\nFiscal 2019 vs.\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2018\nNet sales (in millions)\n$ 16,865.2\n7 %\n$ 15,740.4\nContributions from volume growth (a)\n5 pts\nNet price realization and mix\n4 pts\nForeign currency exchange\n(2)pts\n(a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.\nThe 7 percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, favorable net price realization and mix across all other segments, and higher contributions from volume growth in the Asia & Latin America segment, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth in the North America Retail, Europe & Australia, and Convenience Stores & Foodservice segments.\nComponents of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table:\nFiscal 2019 vs. Fiscal 2018\nContributions from organic volume growth (a)\n(2)pts\nOrganic net price realization and mix\n2 pts\nOrganic net sales growth\nFlat\nForeign currency exchange\n(2)pts\nAcquisition and divestitures\n9 pts\nNet sales growth\n7 pts\n(a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.\nOrganic net sales in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to fiscal 2018, as favorable organic net price realization and mix was offset by declining contributions from organic volume growth.\nCost of sales increased $804 million in fiscal 2019 to $11,108 million. The increase was driven by a $503 million increase due to higher volume and a $194 million increase attributable to product rate and mix, including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53 million charge related to the fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We recorded a $36 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of $32 million in fiscal 2018 (please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2019, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges in cost of\nsales compared to $14 million in fiscal 2018. We also recorded $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 compared to $11 million in fiscal 2018 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).\nGross margin increased 6 percent in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34.1 percent decreased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2018.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $86 million to $2,936 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by a decrease in media and advertising expense. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased 70 basis points compared to fiscal 2018.\nDivestitures loss totaled $30 million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salte\u00f1a fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $35 million. We also sold our yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait brand. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $5 million.\nRestructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $275 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $166 million in fiscal 2018.\nIn fiscal 2019, as a result of lower sales projections in our long range plans for the businesses supporting our Progresso, Food Should Taste Good, and Mountain High brand intangible assets, we recorded $193 million of impairment charges related to these brand intangible assets (please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).\nIn addition, in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $15 million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segments.\nCharges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2019 consisted of the following:\nExpense, in Millions\nTargeted actions in global supply chain\n$ 80.2\nCharges associated with restructuring actions previously announced\n(2.6)\nTotal (a)\n$ 77.6\n(a) Includes restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales of $9.9 million.\nIn fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In connection with these actions we recorded $80 million of restructuring charges, consisting of $23 million of severance expense and $57 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. Four of our operating segments were affected by these actions including $54 million related to our North America Retail segment, $13 million related to our Asia & Latin America segment, $12 million related to our Europe & Australia segment, and $1 million related to our Pet segment. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022.\nWe spent $49 million of cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.\nPlease see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nBenefit plan non-service income totaled $88 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $89 million in fiscal 2018 (please see to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information).\nInterest, net for fiscal 2019 totaled $522 million, $148 million higher than fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher debt levels due to financing for the Blue Buffalo acquisition.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 17.7 percent compared to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2018. The 15.0 percentage point increase reflects the lower statutory rate in fiscal 2019 being more than offset by the impact of the one-time, provisional net benefit of $524 million recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the TCJA. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8 percent in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.7 percent in fiscal 2018 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the net benefits associated with the TCJA, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by jurisdiction.\nThe TCJA includes provisions affecting our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations to 21 percent; a provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (GILTI); a limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. In fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability.\nAfter-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased $13 million to $72 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11 million after-tax share of restructuring charges at CPW, and lower net sales and higher input costs for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 14 percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures net sales growth are shown in the following table:\nFiscal 2019 vs. Fiscal 2018\nCPW\nHDJ\nTotal\nContributions from volume growth (a)\n(1) pt\n(3) pts\nNet price realization and mix\n2 pts\n(4) pts\nNet sales growth in constant currency\n1 pt\n(7) pts\n(1) pt\nForeign currency exchange\n(6) pts\n(1) pt\n(5) pts\nNet sales growth\n(5) pts\n(8) pts\n(6) pts\n(a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.\nAverage diluted shares outstanding increased by 20 million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 due to the impact of the fiscal 2018 share issuance to partially fund the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and option exercises.\nRESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS\nOur businesses are organized into five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nThe following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2019 and 2018:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nDollars\nPercent of\nTotal\nDollars\nPercent of\nTotal\nNet Sales\nNorth America Retail\n$ 9,925.2\n59%\n$ 10,115.4\n64%\nConvenience Stores & Foodservice\n1,969.1\n1,930.2\nEurope & Australia\n1,886.7\n1,984.6\nAsia & Latin America\n1,653.3\n1,710.2\nPet\n1,430.9\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 16,865.2\n100%\n$ 15,740.4\n100%\nSegment Operating Profit\nNorth America Retail\n$ 2,277.2\n72%\n$ 2,217.4\n80%\nConvenience Stores & Foodservice\n419.5\n392.6\nEurope & Australia\n123.3\n142.1\nAsia & Latin America\n72.4\n39.6\nPet\n268.4\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 3,160.8\n100%\n$ 2,791.7\n100%\nSegment operating profit as reviewed by our executive management excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain/loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs that are centrally managed.\nNORTH AMERICA RETAIL SEGMENT\nOur North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers.

Pet operating profit includes a $53 million purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired and $13 million of amortization of the customer list intangible asset.\nUNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS\nUnallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIn fiscal 2019, unallocated corporate expense increased $134 million to $340 million compared to $206 million last year, primarily driven by compensation and benefits expenses. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $36 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $32 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $10 million of restructuring charges, and $1 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019, compared to $14 million of restructuring charges and $11 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018.

We also recorded $26 million of integration costs in fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo compared to $34 million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded a $3 million loss related to the impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nWe experienced input cost inflation of 4 percent in fiscal 2019 and 4 percent in fiscal 2018, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of approximately 4 percent in fiscal 2020. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments. For information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe management of General Mills, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States, using managements best estimates and judgments where appropriate. The financial information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has established a system of internal controls that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately safeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately in all material respects, in accordance with managements authorization. We maintain a strong audit program that independently evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. Our internal controls provide for appropriate separation of duties and responsibilities, and there are documented policies regarding use of our assets and proper financial reporting. These formally stated and regularly communicated policies demand highly ethical conduct from all employees.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets regularly with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to review internal control, auditing, and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors, and employees have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.\nThe Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Companys annual financial statements. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, that the consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report. The Audit Committee also appointed KPMG LLP to serve as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2020.\n/s/ J. L. Harmening\n/s/ D. L. Mulligan\nJ. L. Harmening\nD. L. Mulligan\nChief Executive Officer\nChief Financial Officer\nJune 27, 2019\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nGeneral Mills, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 26, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May 26, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 26, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9a Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1928.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nJune 27, 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nGENERAL MILLS, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May.\nCertain reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 for additional information.\nChange in Reporting Period\nAs part of a long-term plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia & Latin America segment from an April fiscal year-end to a May fiscal year-end to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInventories\nAll inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.\nInventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, or net realizable value.\nShipping costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.\nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation\nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May 26, 2019, assets held for sale were insignificant.\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows and are largely\nindependent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years.\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totinos, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Progresso, Annies, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and Yoki brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\nOur investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily research and development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices.\nIn addition, we assess our investments in our joint ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of capital, or significant business disruptions. The significant assumptions\nused to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary.\nRedeemable Interest\nWe have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaals interest as a redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interests redemption value, which approximates its fair value. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, we adjusted the redeemable interests redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues primarily result from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation - the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited case-by-case basis with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and collection patterns are short-term, and vary around the world and by channel, and as such, we do not have any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers.\nEnvironmental Costs\nEnvironmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action.\nAdvertising Production Costs\nWe expense the production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.\nResearch and Development\nAll expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities, including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the period-end exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI.\nDerivative Instruments\nAll derivatives are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share of our stock on the date of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally, stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results.\nCertain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period.\nWe report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow.\nDefined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans\nWe sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.\nWe recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI.\nIn fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively net periodic benefit expense). The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profit of $87.9 million, $89.4 million and $74.3 million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan non-service income of $87.9 million, $89.4 million and $74.3 million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. There were no changes to our reported segment operating profit.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new standard, we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The principles-based five step model includes: 1) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determining the transaction price; 4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We utilized a comprehensive approach to evaluate and document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices. We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments to all contracts in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach.\nWe recorded a $33.9 million cumulative effect adjustment net of income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to deferred income taxes of $11.4 million, and an increase to other current liabilities of $45.3 million related to the timing of recognition of certain promotional expenditures.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is not available, prepared, or analyzed to determine a reasonable estimate, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA. In fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allowed for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits, which resulted in reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax withholdings, which resulted in reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the amount by which a reporting units carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill impairment test was performed as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidance retrospectively and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal year-end that does not coincide with a month-end to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entitys fiscal year-end and apply such practical expedient consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nNOTE 3. ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salte\u00f1a fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a pre-tax loss of $35.4 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our\nyogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the Yoplait brand. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $5.4 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0 billion, including $103.0 million of consideration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with the definitive agreement and plan of merger, a subsidiary of General Mills merged into Blue Buffalo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In accordance with the merger agreement, equity holders of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per share in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0 billion in debt, $1.0 billion in equity, and cash on hand. In fiscal 2019, we recorded acquisition integration costs of $25.6 million in SG&A expenses. In fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition transaction and integration costs of $34.0 million in SG&A expenses and $49.9 million in interest, net related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition.\nWe consolidated Blue Buffalo into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3 billion, an indefinite-lived intangible asset for the Blue Buffalo brand of $2.7 billion, and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of $269.0 million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductible for tax purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6 million increase to goodwill.\nThe consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our Pet operating segment on a one-month lag.\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma information is presented as if we had acquired Blue Buffalo at the beginning of fiscal 2017:\nUnaudited\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet sales\n$ 17,057.4\n$ 16,772.9\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n2,252.4\n1,540.2\nThe fiscal 2017 pro forma amounts include transaction and integration costs of $83.9 million and the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value of $52.7 million. The fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 pro forma amounts include interest expense of $238.7 million on the debt issued to finance the transaction and amortization expense of $13.5 million based on the estimated fair value and useful life of the customer relationships intangible asset. Additionally, the pro forma amounts include an increase to cost of sales by $1.6 million in fiscal 2017 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2018 to reflect the impact of using the LIFO method of inventory valuation on Blue Buffalos historical operating results. Pro forma amounts include related tax effects of $125.1 million in fiscal 2017 and $14.5 million in fiscal 2018. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017 or of future results.\nNOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER EXIT COSTS\nASSET IMPAIRMENTS\nIn fiscal 2019, we recorded a $192.6 million charge related to the impairment of our Progresso, Food Should Taste Good, and Mountain High brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Please see Note 6 for additional information.\nIn fiscal 2019, we recorded a $14.8 million charge in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in our North America Retail and Asia & Latin America segments.\nIn fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Yoki, Mountain High, and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs.\nRESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES\nWe view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with restructured assets, as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved.\nCharges recorded in fiscal 2019 were as follows:\nExpense, in Millions\nTargeted actions in global supply chain\n$ 80.2\nCharges associated with restructuring actions previously announced\n(2.6)\nTotal\n$ 77.6\nIn fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In our North America Retail segment, we approved actions at certain facilities to consolidate production and optimize our labor and manufacturing platforms. In connection with these actions we will exit our Carson, California yogurt manufacturing facility. We expect to incur approximately $101 million of restructuring charges related to these actions, including $10 million of severance expense and $91 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We also expect to incur approximately $2 million of project-related costs. We recorded $9.9 million of severance and $44.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we approved targeted systems and process optimization actions in our Europe & Australia segment and expect to incur approximately $15 million of restructuring charges, including $11 million of severance expense and $4 million of other costs. We recorded $11.3 million of severance and $0.7 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming product lines in our Asia & Latin America segment and expect to incur approximately $14 million of restructuring charges, including $1 million of severance expense and $13 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We recorded $1.0 million of severance and $11.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming markets in our Pet segment and expect to incur approximately $8 million of restructuring charges, including $2 million of severance expense and $6 million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We recorded $0.8 million of severance and $0.5 million of other costs in fiscal 2019.\nCertain of these global supply chain actions are subject to union negotiations and works counsel consultations, where required. We expect to spend approximately $35 million of cash related to these actions and spent $1.7 million in fiscal 2019. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022.\nIn fiscal 2019, we paid $49.3 million in cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.\nCharges recorded in fiscal 2018 were as follows:\nExpense, in Millions\nGlobal cost savings initiatives\n$ 49.3\nCharges associated with restructuring actions previously announced\n33.4\nTotal\n$ 82.7\nCharges recorded in fiscal 2017 were as follows:\nExpense, in Millions\nGlobal reorganization\n$ 72.1\nRestructuring of certain international product lines\n45.1\nClosure of Vineland, New Jersey plant\n41.4\nClosure of Melbourne, Australia plant\n21.9\nCharges associated with restructuring actions previously announced\n43.6\nTotal\n$ 224.1\nRestructuring and impairment charges and project-related costs are classified in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as follows:\nFiscal\nIn Millions\nRestructuring, impairment, and other exit costs\n$ 275.1\n$ 165.6\n$ 180.4\nCost of sales\n9.9\n14.0\n41.5\nTotal restructuring charges\n285.0\n179.6\n221.9\nProject-related costs classified in cost of sales\n$ 1.3\n$ 11.3\n$ 43.9\nThe roll forward of our restructuring and other exit cost reserves, included in other current liabilities, is as follows:\nIn Millions\nSeverance\nContract\nTermination\nOther\nExit Costs\nTotal\nReserve balance as of May 29, 2016\n$ 73.6\n$ 1.5\n$ 1.5\n$ 76.6\nFiscal 2017 charges, including foreign currency translation\n95.0\n0.9\n8.1\n104.0\nUtilized in fiscal 2017\n(86.8 )\n(1.7 )\n(7.1 )\n(95.6 )\nReserve balance as of May 28, 2017\n81.8\n0.7\n2.5\n85.0\nFiscal 2018 charges, including foreign currency translation\n40.8\n0.2\n(0.7 )\n40.3\nUtilized in fiscal 2018\n(56.6 )\n(0.8 )\n(1.1 )\n(58.5 )\nReserve balance as of May 27, 2018\n66.0\n0.1\n0.7\n66.8\nFiscal 2019 charges, including foreign currency translation\n7.7\n2.5\n1.4\n11.6\nUtilized in fiscal 2019\n(37.2 )\n(2.6 )\n(2.1 )\n(41.9 )\nReserve balance as of May 26, 2019\n$ 36.5\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 36.5\nThe charges recognized in the roll forward of our reserves for restructuring and other exit costs do not include items charged directly to expense (e.g., asset impairment charges, the gain or loss on the sale of restructured assets, and the write-off of spare parts) and other periodic exit costs recognized as incurred, as those items are not reflected in our restructuring and other exit cost reserves on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 5. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES\nWe have a 50 percent equity interest in Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), which manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries outside the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. We have guaranteed a portion of CPWs debt and its pension obligation in the United Kingdom.\nWe also have a 50 percent equity interest in H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ).

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6 million increase to goodwill.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 are as follows:\nIn Millions\nNorth\nAmerica\nRetail\nPet\nConvenience\nStores &\nFoodservice\nEurope &\nAustralia\nAsia &\nLatin\nAmerica\nJoint\nVentures\nTotal\nBalance as of May 29, 2016\n$ 6,410.3\n$ -\n$ 921.1\n$ 716.5\n$ 287.1\n$ 406.2\n$ 8,741.2\nDivestiture\n-\n-\n(2.3 )\n-\n-\n-\n(2.3 )\nOther activity, primarily foreign currency translation\n(3.8 )\n-\n-\n(15.7 )\n25.3\n2.5\n8.3\nBalance as of May 28, 2017\n6,406.5\n-\n918.8\n700.8\n312.4\n408.7\n8,747.2\nAcquisition\n-\n5,294.9\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5,294.9\nOther activity, primarily foreign currency translation\n4.1\n-\n-\n29.1\n(27.4 )\n17.1\n22.9\nBalance as of May 27, 2018\n6,410.6\n5,294.9\n918.8\n729.9\n285.0\n425.8\n14,065.0\nDivestitures\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(0.5 )\n-\n(0.5 )\nPurchase accounting adjustment\n-\n5.6\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5.6\nOther activity, primarily foreign currency translation\n(4.1 )\n-\n-\n(29.5 )\n(24.3 )\n(16.4 )\n(74.3 )\nBalance as of May 26, 2019\n$ 6,406.5\n$ 5,300.5\n$ 918.8\n$ 700.4\n$ 260.2\n$ 409.4\n$ 13,995.8\nThe changes in the carrying amount of other intangible assets for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 are as follows:\nIn Millions\nTotal\nBalance as of May 29, 2016\n$ 4,538.6\nOther activity, primarily amortization and foreign currency translation\n(8.2 )\nBalance as of May 28, 2017\n4,530.4\nAcquisition\n3,015.0\nImpairment charge\n(96.9 )\nOther activity, primarily amortization and foreign currency translation\n(3.4 )\nBalance as of May 27, 2018\n7,445.1\nImpairment charges\n(192.6 )\nOther activity, primarily amortization and foreign currency translation\n(85.7 )\nBalance as of May 26, 2019\n$ 7,166.8\nOur annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets test was performed on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of lower sales projections in our long-range plans for the businesses supporting the Progresso, Food Should Taste Good, and Mountain High brand intangible assets, we recorded the following impairment charges:\nIn Millions\nImpairment\nCharge\nFair Value as of\nNov. 25, 2018 (a)\nProgresso\n$ 132.1\n$ 330.0\nFood Should Taste Good\n45.1\n-\nMountain High\n15.4\n-\nTotal\n$ 192.6\n$ 330.0\n(a) Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Yoki, Mountain High, and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs.\nSignificant assumptions used in that assessment included our long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted-average cost of capital rates, and tax rates.\nOur Latin America reporting unit and the Yoki brand intangible asset had fair values that were not substantially in excess of the carrying values. The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2019 test date of the Latin America reporting unit and the Yoki brand intangible asset were as follows:\nIn Millions\nCarrying Value\nof Intangible\nAsset\nExcess Fair Value as\nof Fiscal 2019 Test\nDate\nLatin America\n$ 209.0\n7%\nYoki\n$ 49.1\n10%\nWhile having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date, the Pillsbury brand intangible asset and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.\nNOTE 7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, AND FAIR VALUES\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, other current liabilities, and notes payable approximate fair value. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. As of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, a comparison of cost and market values of our marketable debt and equity securities is as follows:\nCost\nFair Value\nGross Gains\nGross Losses\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nAvailable for sale debt securities\n$ 34.3\n$ 25.4\n$ 34.3\n$ 25.4\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\nEquity securities\n0.6\n0.3\n18.5\n3.5\n17.9\n3.2\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 34.9\n$ 25.7\n$ 52.8\n$ 28.9\n$ 17.9\n$ 3.2\n$ -\n$ -\nThere were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, we realized $6.8 million of gains from the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities. Gains and losses are determined by specific identification. Classification of marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period and the securitys maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI within stockholders equity.\nScheduled maturities of our marketable securities are as follows:\nMarketable Securities\nIn Millions\nCost\nFair Value\nUnder 1 year (current)\n$ 34.3\n$ 34.3\nEquity securities\n0.6\n18.5\nTotal\n$ 34.9\n$ 52.8\nAs of May 26, 2019, we had $2.3 million of certain marketable debt securities pledged as collateral for derivative contracts. As of May 26, 2019, $34.8 million of certain accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted line of credit.\nThe fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $13,272.8 million and $13,021.3 million, respectively, as of May 26, 2019. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level 2 liability in the fair value hierarchy.\nRISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES\nAs a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established policies.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nMany commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of\ncommodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and over-the-counter options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible.\nWe use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAlthough we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items.\nUnallocated corporate items for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 included:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet gain (loss) on mark-to-market valuation of commodity positions\n$ (39.0 )\n$ 14.3\n$ (22.0 )\nNet loss on commodity positions reclassified from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit\n10.0\n11.3\n32.0\nNet mark-to-market revaluation of certain grain inventories\n(7.0 )\n6.5\n3.9\nNet mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions recognized in unallocated corporate items\n$ (36.0 )\n$ 32.1\n$ 13.9\nAs of May 26, 2019, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $312.5 million, of which $242.9 million related to agricultural inputs and $69.6 million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.\nFloating Interest Rate Exposures - Floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2019, a $2.6 million loss in fiscal 2018, and less than $1 million in fiscal 2017.\nFixed Interest Rate Exposures - Fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt and derivatives, using\nincremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.4 million gain in fiscal 2019, a $3.4 million loss in fiscal 2018, and a $4.3 million gain in fiscal 2017.\nIn advance of planned debt financing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0 million of treasury locks due April 19, 2018, with an average fixed rate of 2.9 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $43.9 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our $850.0 million 5.5-year fixed-rate notes, $800.0 million 7-year fixed-rate notes, $1,400.0 million 10-year fixed-rate notes, $500.0 million 20-year fixed-rate notes, and $650.0 million 30-year fixed-rate notes.\nIn advance of planned debt financing, in fiscal 2018, we entered into $500.0 million of treasury locks due October 15, 2017 with an average fixed rate of 1.8 percent. All of these treasury locks were cash settled for $3.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018, concurrent with the issuance of our $500.0 million 5-year fixed-rate notes.\nAs of May 26, 2019, the pre-tax amount of cash-settled interest rate hedge gain or loss remaining in AOCI, which will be reclassified to earnings over the remaining term of the related underlying debt, follows:\nIn Millions\nGain/(Loss)\n3.15% notes due December 15, 2021\n$ (25.3 )\n2.6% notes due October 12, 2022\n2.5\n1.0% notes due April 27, 2023\n(0.9 )\n3.7% notes due October 17, 2023\n(1.5 )\n3.65% notes due February 15, 2024\n8.4\n4.0% notes due April 17, 2025\n(3.4 )\n3.2% notes due February 10, 2027\n13.2\n1.5% notes due April 27, 2027\n(2.6 )\n4.2% notes due April 17, 2028\n(9.1 )\n4.55% notes due April 17, 2038\n(10.3 )\n5.4% notes due June 15, 2040\n(11.8 )\n4.15% notes due February 15, 2043\n9.3\n4.7% notes due April 17, 2048\n(13.7 )\nNet pre-tax hedge loss in AOCI\n$ (45.2 )\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and weighted-average interest rates of our interest rate derivatives.

We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen,\nMexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance.\nAs of May 26, 2019, the net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $1,008.5 million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1 million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nWe also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May 26, 2019, we hedged a portion of these net investments with \u00802,200.0 million of euro denominated bonds. As of May 26, 2019, we had deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of $51.5 million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity.\nEQUITY INSTRUMENTS\nEquity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued. We use equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May 26, 2019, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $169.1 million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2020.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION\nThe fair values of our assets, liabilities, and derivative positions recorded at fair value and their respective levels in the fair value hierarchy as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, were as follows:\nMay 26, 2019\nMay 26, 2019\nFair Values of Assets\nFair Values of Liabilities\nIn Millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts (a) (b)\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ (1.9)\n$ -\n$ (1.9)\nForeign exchange contracts (c) (d)\n-\n12.9\n-\n12.9\n-\n(3.3)\n-\n(3.3)\nTotal\n-\n12.9\n-\n12.9\n-\n(5.2)\n-\n(5.2)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts (c) (d)\n-\n2.4\n-\n2.4\n-\n(1.9)\n-\n(1.9)\nCommodity contracts (c) (e)\n1.4\n5.2\n-\n6.6\n(4.4)\n(3.5)\n-\n(7.9)\nGrain contracts (c) (e)\n-\n6.7\n-\n6.7\n-\n(2.3)\n-\n(2.3)\nTotal\n1.4\n14.3\n-\n15.7\n(4.4)\n(7.7)\n-\n(12.1)\nOther assets and liabilities reported at fair value:\nMarketable investments (a) (f)\n18.5\n34.3\n-\n52.8\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLong-lived assets (g)\n-\n19.0\n-\n19.0\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets (h)\n-\n-\n330.0\n330.0\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n18.5\n53.3\n330.0\n401.8\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal assets, liabilities, and derivative positions recorded at fair value\n$ 19.9\n$ 80.5\n$ 330.0\n$ 430.4\n$ (4.4)\n$ (12.9)\n$ -\n$ (17.3)\n(a) These contracts and investments are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets, other assets, other current liabilities or other liabilities, as appropriate, based on whether in a gain or loss position.

If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May 26, 2019, was $7.4 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements had been triggered on May 26, 2019, we would have been required to post $7.4 million of collateral to counterparties.\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\nDuring fiscal 2019, customer concentration was as follows:\nPercent of total\nConsolidated\nNorth\nAmerica\nRetail\nConvenience\nStores &\nFoodservice\nEurope &\nAustralia\nAsia & Latin\nAmerica\nPet\nWalmart (a):\nNet sales\n20%\n31%\n7%\n1%\n4%\n3%\nAccounts receivable\n22%\n3%\n1%\n6%\n9%\nFive largest customers:\nNet sales\n55%\n45%\n24%\n12%\n69%\n(a) Includes Walmart Inc. and its affiliates.\nNo customer other than Walmart accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated net sales.\nWe enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges.\nThe amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is $2.4 million against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults.\nWe offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments online. The third party services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship with the suppliers, the third parties, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May 26, 2019, $1,049.8 million of our accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize these third party services.\nNOTE 8.

We may redeem the notes if certain tax laws change and we would be obligated to pay additional amounts on the notes. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. We used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay our \u0080300.0 million floating rate notes.\nIn February 2019, we repaid $1,150.0 million of 5.65 percent fixed-rate notes with proceeds from commercial paper.\nIn April 2018, we issued $4,800.0 million principal amount of fixed-rate notes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition.

We recorded the $13.8 million premium paid in the repurchase as net interest expense.\nIn October 2017, we issued $500.0 million principal amount of 2.6 percent fixed-rate notes due October 12, 2022. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $500.0 million of 1.4 percent fixed-rate notes.\nA summary of our long-term debt is as follows:\nIn Millions\nMay 26,\nMay 27,\n4.2% notes due April 17, 2028\n$ 1,400.0\n$ 1,400.0\n5.65% notes due February 15, 2019\n-\n1,150.0\n3.15% notes due December 15, 2021\n1,000.0\n1,000.0\n3.7% notes due October 17, 2023\n850.0\n850.0\nFloating-rate notes due April 16, 2021\n850.0\n850.0\n4.0% notes due April 17, 2025\n800.0\n800.0\n3.2% notes due February 10, 2027\n750.0\n750.0\n4.7% notes due April 17, 2048\n650.0\n650.0\n3.2% notes due April 16, 2021\n600.0\n600.0\nEuro-denominated 2.1% notes due November 16, 2020\n560.1\n582.6\nEuro-denominated 1.0% notes due April 27, 2023\n560.1\n582.6\nEuro-denominated floating-rate notes due January 15, 2020\n560.1\n582.6\n4.55% notes due April 17, 2038\n500.0\n500.0\n2.6% notes due October 12, 2022\n500.0\n500.0\n5.4% notes due June 15, 2040\n500.0\n500.0\n4.15% notes due February 15, 2043\n500.0\n500.0\n3.65% notes due February 15, 2024\n500.0\n500.0\n2.2% notes due October 21, 2019\n500.0\n500.0\nEuro-denominated 1.5% notes due April 27, 2027\n448.1\n466.1\nFloating-rate notes due October 17, 2023\n400.0\n400.0\nEuro-denominated 0.0% notes due January 15, 2020\n336.1\n-\nEuro-denominated floating-rate notes due March 20, 2019\n-\n349.6\nEuro-denominated 2.2% notes due June 24, 2021\n224.0\n232.8\nMedium-term notes, 2.36% to 6.59%, due fiscal 2022 or later\n104.2\n104.2\nOther, including debt issuance costs and capital leases\n(71.4)\n(81.7)\n13,021.3\n14,268.8\nLess amount due within one year\n(1,396.5)\n(1,600.1)\nTotal long-term debt\n$ 11,624.8\n$ 12,668.7\nPrincipal payments due on long-term debt and capital leases in the next five years based on stated contractual maturities, our intent to redeem, or put rights of certain note holders are as follows:\nIn Millions\n$ 1,396.5\n2,114.4\n1,224.1\n1,060.2\n1,750.0\nCertain of our long-term debt agreements contain restrictive covenants.

The amount expected to be reclassified from AOCI to net interest in fiscal 2020 is a $9.4 million pre-tax loss.\nNOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nOur principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl, and General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $4.9 million as of May 26, 2019.\nWe have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4 million fair value of Sodiaals 49 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional paid-in capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interests redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain financial metrics set forth in its shareholders agreement. As of May 26, 2019, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $551.7 million.\nOn the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4 million fair value of Sodiaals 50 percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and 50 percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS for the rights to Yoplait and related trademarks. Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to Libert\u00e9 and related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of their fiscal year end.\nWe paid dividends of $22.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $37.7 million in fiscal 2018 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Libert\u00e9 Marques S\u00e0rl shareholder agreements.\nA subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined prices through July 1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $210.8 million for fiscal 2019 and $230.8 million for fiscal 2018.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $55.7 million in Yoplait SAS.\nThe holder of the GMC Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holders capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $251.5 million). On June 1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMCs Class A interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investors share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOur noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 26, 2019, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nNOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCumulative preference stock of 5.0 million shares, without par value, is authorized but unissued.\nOn May 6, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date.\nOn March 27, 2018, we issued 22.7 million shares of the Companys common stock, par value $0.10 per share, at a public offering price of $44.00 per share for total proceeds of $1.0 billion. We paid $30.1 million in issuance costs, that were recorded in additional paid-in capital. The net proceeds of $969.9 million were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of Blue Buffalo.\nShare repurchases were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nShares of common stock\n-\n10.9\n25.4\nAggregate purchase price\n$ 1.1\n$ 601.6\n$ 1,651.5\nThe following table provides details of total comprehensive income:\nFiscal 2019\nGeneral Mills\nNoncontrolling\nInterests\nRedeemable\nInterest\nIn Millions\nPretax\nTax\nNet\nNet\nNet\nNet earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests\n$ 1,752.7\n$ 13.9\n$ 19.6\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nForeign currency translation\n$ (38.3)\n$ -\n(38.3)\n(13.5)\n(31.0)\nNet actuarial loss\n(325.6)\n72.2\n(253.4)\n-\n-\nOther fair value changes:\nHedge derivatives\n15.9\n(3.7)\n12.2\n-\n(0.1)\nReclassification to earnings:\nSecurities (a)\n(2.6)\n0.6\n(2.0)\n-\n-\nHedge derivatives (b)\n0.1\n0.4\n0.5\n-\n0.4\nAmortization of losses and prior service costs (c)\n107.5\n(22.9)\n84.6\n-\n-\nOther comprehensive loss\n(243.0)\n46.6\n(196.4)\n(13.5)\n(30.7)\nTotal comprehensive income (loss)\n$ 1,556.3\n$ 0.4\n$ (11.1)\n(a) Gain reclassified from AOCI into earnings is reported in interest, net for securities.\n(b) Loss reclassified from AOCI into earnings is reported in interest, net for interest rate swaps and in cost of sales and SG&A expenses for foreign exchange contracts.\n(c) Loss reclassified from AOCI into earnings is reported in benefit plan non-service income.

We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. Please see Note 14 for additional information.\nNOTE 11. STOCK PLANS\nWe use broad-based stock plans to help ensure that managements interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May 26, 2019, a total of 30.3 million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and shares of unrestricted stock under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards now outstanding include some granted under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and 2011 compensation plans for non-employee directors, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock plans provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors.\nStock Options\nThe estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nEstimated fair values of stock options granted\n$ 5.35\n$ 6.18\n$ 8.80\nAssumptions:\nRisk-free interest rate\n2.9 %\n2.2%\n1.7 %\nExpected term\n8.5 years\n8.2 years\n8.5 years\nExpected volatility\n16.3 %\n15.8%\n17.8 %\nDividend yield\n4.3 %\n3.6%\n2.9 %\nWe estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility.\nOur expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nAny corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We recognized windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $24.5 million in fiscal 2019 and $25.5 million in fiscal 2018.\nOptions may be priced at 100 percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest four years after the date of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant.\nInformation on stock option activity follows:\nOptions\nOutstanding\n(Thousands)\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per\nShare\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(Millions)\nBalance as of May 27, 2018\n28,963.8\n$ 42.90\nGranted\n3,149.8\n46.09\nExercised\n(7,968.1 )\n30.96\nForfeited or expired\n(492.5 )\n53.73\nOutstanding as of May 26, 2019\n23,653.0\n$ 47.12\n4.82\n$ 180.0\nExercisable as of May 26, 2019\n14,219.0\n41.80\n2.79\n$ 159.8\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards was $14.7 million in fiscal 2019, $15.5 million in fiscal 2018, and $18.0 million in fiscal 2017. Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs for fiscal 2018 and 2017.\nNet cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options less shares used for minimum withholding taxes and the intrinsic value of options exercised were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet cash proceeds\n$ 241.4\n$ 99.3\n$ 112.6\nIntrinsic value of options exercised\n$ 126.7\n$ 83.6\n$ 176.5\nRestricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units\nStock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2017 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to a three year performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of these\nawards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if the awards vest.\nInformation on restricted stock unit and performance share unit activity follows:\nEquity Classified\nLiability Classified\nShare-\nSettled\nUnits\n(Thousands)\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nShare-\nSettled\nUnits\n(Thousands)\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nNon-vested as of May 27, 2018\n3,731.8\n$ 57.50\n121.3\n$ 58.26\nGranted\n1,814.5\n46.14\n33.8\n46.16\nVested\n(880.6 )\n51.30\n(35.2 )\n55.48\nForfeited or expired\n(393.4 )\n58.44\n(11.8 )\n57.64\nNon-vested as of May 26, 2019\n4,272.3\n$ 53.87\n108.1\n$ 55.45\nFiscal Year\nNumber of units granted (thousands)\n1,848.2\n1,551.3\n1,462.3\nWeighted-average price per unit\n$ 46.14\n$ 55.12\n$ 67.01\nThe total grant-date fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested was $47.1 million in fiscal 2019 and $93.0 million in fiscal 2018.\nAs of May 26, 2019, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units was $98.4 million. This expense will be recognized over 21 months, on average.\nStock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units and performance share units was $70.2 million for fiscal 2019, $62.4 million for fiscal 2018, and $77.9 million for fiscal 2017. Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nNOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted EPS were calculated using the following:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions, Except per Share Data\nNet earnings attributable to General Mills\n$ 1,752.7\n$ 2,131.0\n$ 1,657.5\nAverage number of common shares-basic EPS\n600.4\n576.8\n587.1\nIncremental share effect from: (a)\nStock options\n3.1\n6.9\n8.1\nRestricted stock units, performance share units, and other\n1.9\n2.0\n2.8\nAverage number of common shares-diluted EPS\n605.4\n585.7\n598.0\nEarnings per share-basic\n$ 2.92\n$ 3.69\n$ 2.82\nEarnings per share -diluted\n$ 2.90\n$ 3.64\n$ 2.77\n(a) Incremental shares from stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units are computed by the treasury stock method. Stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units excluded from our computation of diluted EPS because they were not dilutive were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nAnti-dilutive stock options, restricted stock units,\nand performance share units\n14.1\n8.9\n2.3\nNOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June 1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan.\nIn fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May 31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rates\nAssumed health care cost trends are as follows:\nFiscal Year\nHealth care cost trend rate for next year\n6.4% and 6.7%\n6.7% and 7.0%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate rate)\n4.5%\n4.5%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\nWe review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5 percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.\nA one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects:\nIn Millions\nOne\nPercentage\nPoint\nIncrease\nOne\nPercentage\nPoint\nDecrease\nEffect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2020\n$ 1.4\n$ (1.3)\nEffect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 26, 2019\n$ 43.5\n$ (40.3)\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nUnder certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred.

Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May 31 to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nThe fair values of our pension and postretirement benefit plans assets and their respective levels in the fair value hierarchy by asset category were as follows:\nFiscal Year 2019\nFiscal Year 2018\nIn Millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\nFair value measurement of pension plan assets:\nEquity (a)\n$ 1,226.2\n$ 664.6\n$ -\n$ 1,890.8\n$ 1,722.5\n$ 782.1\n$ -\n$ 2,504.6\nFixed income (b)\n1,635.5\n1,144.9\n-\n2,780.4\n1,264.5\n714.5\n-\n1,979.0\nReal asset investments (c)\n179.4\n59.9\n-\n239.3\n229.1\n115.2\n-\n344.3\nOther investments (d)\n-\n-\n0.3\n0.3\n-\n-\n0.3\n0.3\nCash and accruals\n186.5\n-\n-\n186.5\n124.4\n-\n-\n124.4\nFair value measurement of pension plan assets\n$ 3,227.6\n$ 1,869.4\n$ 0.3\n$ 5,097.3\n$ 3,340.5\n$ 1,611.8\n$ 0.3\n$ 4,952.6\nAssets measured at net asset value (e)\n1,194.3\n1,224.8\nTotal pension plan assets (f)\n$ 6,291.6\n$ 6,177.4\nFair value measurement of postretirement benefit plan assets:\nEquity (a)\n$ -\n$ 66.8\n$ -\n$ 66.8\n$ -\n$ 35.8\n$ -\n$ 35.8\nFixed income (b)\n139.7\n241.4\n-\n381.1\n241.0\n123.6\n-\n364.6\nReal asset investments (c)\n0.3\n-\n-\n0.3\n8.0\n-\n-\n8.0\nCash and accruals\n11.1\n-\n-\n11.1\n19.1\n-\n-\n19.1\nFair value measurement of Postretirement benefit plan assets\n$ 151.1\n$ 308.2\n$ -\n$ 459.3\n$ 268.1\n$ 159.4\n$ -\n$ 427.5\nAssets measured at net asset value (e)\n294.5\n298.6\nTotal postretirement benefit plan assets (f)\n$ 753.8\n$ 726.1\n(a) Primarily publicly traded common stock for purposes of total return and to maintain equity exposure consistent with policy allocations.

We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation.\nWeighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nDefined Benefit\nPension Plans\nOther Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year\nAsset category:\nUnited States equities\n20.3 %\n25.8 %\n19.1 %\n20.6 %\nInternational equities\n12.5\n16.1\n11.2\n10.7\nPrivate equities\n8.1\n7.7\n4.9\n4.2\nFixed income\n46.7\n36.1\n61.3\n59.6\nReal assets\n12.4\n14.3\n3.5\n4.9\nTotal\n100.0 %\n100.0 %\n100.0 %\n100.0 %\nThe investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is: 18 percent to equities in the United States; 11 percent to international equities; 9 percent to private equities; 48 percent to fixed income; and 14 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure). For other U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18 percent to equities in the United States; 10 percent to international equities; 4 percent to private equities; 65 percent to fixed income; and 3 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.\nContributions and Future Benefit Payments\nWe do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal 2020. Actual fiscal 2020 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2020 to 2029 as follows:\nIn Millions\nDefined\nBenefit\nPension\nPlans\nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefit Plans\nGross Payments\nMedicare\nSubsidy\nReceipts\nPostemployment\nBenefit\nPlans\n$ 319.0\n$ 52.4\n$ 3.2\n$ 20.1\n324.9\n53.9\n3.1\n18.0\n331.8\n55.7\n2.9\n16.6\n338.8\n57.2\n3.0\n15.3\n346.3\n56.9\n3.1\n14.3\n2025-2029\n1,856.4\n282.4\n15.7\n59.6\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union employees. This plan is a 401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net assets of $22.3 million as of May 26, 2019, and $23.9 million as of May 27, 2018. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was $52.7 million in fiscal 2019, $49.2 million in fiscal 2018, and $54.1 million in fiscal 2017.\nWe match a percentage of employee contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment options of the participants choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 5.1 million as of May 26, 2019, and 5.6 million as of May 27, 2018. The ESOPs only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances.\nThe Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $410.1 million and $392.1 million of Company common stock as of May 26, 2019 and May 27, 2018, respectively.\nNOTE 14.

The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate income tax system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and a one-time deemed repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. As a result of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5 million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2 million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods.\nThe legislation also includes provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction; and limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.\nWhile the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules. Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes. In fiscal 2018, we made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period cost.\nAs of May 26, 2019, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3 billion from our foreign operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a tax-neutral transaction. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we re-evaluated our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-02: Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) (ASU 2018-02), which provides the option to reclassify stranded income tax\neffects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4 million from AOCI to retained earnings. This reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate.\nWe are subject to federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash.\nThe number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years.\nSeveral state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations to result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by $40.9 million. We determined the adjustment to be immaterial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2018. We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior.\nDuring fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years. These audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to contest the disallowance.\nWe apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change.\nThe following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. Approximately $81.2 million of this total in fiscal 2019 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the table because certain of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein.\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nBalance, beginning of year\n$ 196.3\n$ 135.5\nTax positions related to current year:\nAdditions\n19.5\n24.1\nReductions\n(0.1)\n-\nTax positions related to prior years:\nAdditions\n3.8\n54.8\nReductions\n(13.2)\n(7.9)\nSettlements\n(41.0)\n(3.9)\nLapses in statutes of limitations\n(26.2)\n(6.3)\nBalance, end of year\n$ 139.1\n$ 196.3\nAs of May 26, 2019, we expect to pay approximately $2.0 million of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount of our unrecognized tax liability was classified in other liabilities.\nWe report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax expense. For fiscal 2019, we recognized $0.5 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $26.0 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 26, 2019. For fiscal 2018, we recognized a net benefit of $3.1 million of tax-related net interest and penalties, and had $27.3 million of accrued interest and penalties as of May 27, 2018.\nNOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES\nOur leases are generally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations was $184.9 million in fiscal 2019, $189.4 million in fiscal 2018, and $188.1 million in fiscal 2017.\nSome operating leases require payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant.\nNoncancelable future lease commitments are:\nIn Millions\nOperating\nLeases\nCapital\nLeases\nFiscal 2020\n$ 120.0\n$ 0.2\nFiscal 2021\n101.7\n0.1\nFiscal 2022\n85.0\n-\nFiscal 2023\n63.8\n-\nFiscal 2024\n49.1\n-\nAfter fiscal 2024\n63.0\n-\nTotal noncancelable future lease commitments\n$ 482.6\n$ 0.3\nLess: interest\n-\nPresent value of obligations under capital leases\n$ 0.3\nDepreciation on capital leases is recorded as depreciation expense in our results of operations.\nAs of May 26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $681.6 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $133.9 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $482.6 million as of May 26, 2019.\nNOTE 16. BUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nWe operate in the packaged foods industry. Our operating segments are as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; Asia & Latin America; and Pet.\nOur North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and grain snacks.\nOur major product categories in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking mixes. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries in the United States.\nOur Europe & Australia operating segment reflects retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and Australia regions. Our product categories include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, super-premium ice cream, refrigerated and frozen dough products, shelf stable vegetables, grain snacks, and dessert and baking mixes. We also sell super-premium ice cream directly to consumers through owned retail shops. Revenues from franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the franchisee is located.\nOur Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia and South America regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, meal kits, salty and grain snacks, wellness beverages, and refrigerated yogurt.

Our Asia & Latin America segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities and franchise fees are reported in the region or country where the end customer or franchisee is located.\nOur Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, e-commerce retailers, grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs, lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a one-month lag and accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.\nOperating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.\nOur operating segment results were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet sales:\nNorth America Retail\n$ 9,925.2\n$ 10,115.4\n$ 10,196.9\nConvenience Stores & Foodservice\n1,969.1\n1,930.2\n1,870.0\nEurope & Australia\n1,886.7\n1,984.6\n1,824.5\nAsia & Latin America\n1,653.3\n1,710.2\n1,728.4\nPet\n1,430.9\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 16,865.2\n$ 15,740.4\n$ 15,619.8\nOperating profit:\nNorth America Retail\n$ 2,277.2\n$ 2,217.4\n$ 2,303.6\nConvenience Stores & Foodservice\n419.5\n392.6\n401.2\nEurope & Australia\n123.3\n142.1\n164.2\nAsia & Latin America\n72.4\n39.6\n83.6\nPet\n268.4\n-\n-\nTotal segment operating profit\n$ 3,160.8\n$ 2,791.7\n$ 2,952.6\nUnallocated corporate items\n339.8\n206.2\n273.6\nDivestitures loss\n30.0\n-\n6.5\nRestructuring, impairment, and other exit costs\n275.1\n165.6\n180.4\nOperating profit\n$ 2,515.9\n$ 2,419.9\n$ 2,492.1\nNet sales for our North America Retail operating units were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nU.S. Meals & Baking\n$ 3,839.8\n$ 3,865.7\n$ 3,876.6\nU.S. Cereal\n2,255.4\n2,251.8\n2,251.8\nU.S. Snacks\n2,060.9\n2,140.5\n2,098.2\nU.S. Yogurt and Other\n906.7\n927.4\n1,064.3\nCanada\n862.4\n930.0\n906.0\nTotal\n$ 9,925.2\n$ 10,115.4\n$ 10,196.9\nNet sales by class of similar products were as follows:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nSnacks\n$ 3,359.3\n$ 3,419.0\n$ 3,302.2\nCereal\n2,672.2\n2,679.2\n2,673.2\nConvenient meals\n2,641.8\n2,677.4\n2,653.6\nYogurt\n2,193.6\n2,320.1\n2,403.5\nDough\n1,692.8\n1,684.1\n1,690.6\nBaking mixes and ingredients\n1,608.9\n1,653.4\n1,654.1\nPet\n1,430.9\n-\n-\nSuper-premium ice cream\n813.2\n803.7\n738.4\nOther\n452.5\n503.5\n504.2\nTotal\n$ 16,865.2\n$ 15,740.4\n$ 15,619.8\nThe following table provides financial information by geographic area:\nFiscal Year\nIn Millions\nNet sales:\nUnited States\n$ 12,462.8\n$ 11,115.6\n$ 11,160.9\nNon-United States\n4,402.4\n4,624.8\n4,458.9\nTotal\n$ 16,865.2\n$ 15,740.4\n$ 15,619.8\nIn Millions\nMay 26,\nMay 27,\nCash and cash equivalents:\nUnited States\n$ 51.0\n$ 15.7\nNon-United States\n399.0\n383.3\nTotal\n$ 450.0\n$ 399.0\nIn Millions\nMay 26,\nMay 27,\nLand, buildings, and equipment:\nUnited States\n$ 2,872.8\n$ 3,031.7\nNon-United States\n914.4\n1,015.5\nTotal\n$ 3,787.2\n$ 4,047.2\nNOTE 17.
