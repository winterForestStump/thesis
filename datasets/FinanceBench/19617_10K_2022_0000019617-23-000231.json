Morgan SE (JPMSE), which are subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Germany, respectively.\nThe Firms website is www.jpmorganchase.com. JPMorgan Chase makes available on its website, free of charge, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such material to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) at www.sec.gov. JPMorgan Chase makes new and important information about the Firm available on its website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com, including on the Investor Relations section of its website at https://www.jpmorganchase.com/ir. Information on the Firm's website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K or Form 10-K) or the Firms other filings with the SEC. The Firm has adopted, and posted on its website, a Code of Conduct for all employees of the Firm and a Code of Ethics for its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and all other professionals of the Firm worldwide serving in a finance, accounting, treasury, tax or investor relations role.

The Firms consumer business is the Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) segment. The Firms wholesale business segments are the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB), Commercial Banking (CB), and Asset & Wealth Management (AWM).\nA description of the Firms business segments and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases is provided in the Business segment results section of Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (Managements discussion and analysis or MD&A), beginning on page 46 and in Note 32.\nCompetition\nJPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries and affiliates operate in highly competitive environments. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other internet-based companies, financial technology companies, and other companies engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services. The Firms businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Competition also varies based on the types of clients, customers, industries and geographies served. With respect to some of its geographies and products, JPMorgan Chase competes globally; with respect to others, the Firm competes on a national or regional basis. New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge, including firms that offer products and services solely through the internet and non-financial companies that offer products and services that disintermediate traditional banking products and services offered by financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase.\nPart I\nHuman capital\nJPMorgan Chase believes that its long-term growth and success depend on its ability to attract, develop and retain a high-performing and diverse workforce, with inclusion and accessibility as key components of the way the Firm does business. The information provided below relates to JPMorgan Chases full-time and part-time employees and does not include the Firms contractors.\nGlobal workforce\nAs of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase had 293,723 employees globally, an increase of 22,698 employees from the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to additional employees in technology and operations, as well as front office. The Firms employees are located in 63 countries, with over 60% of the Firms employees located in the U.S. The following table presents the distribution of the Firms global workforce by region and by line of business (LOB) and Corporate as of December 31, 2022:\nEmployee Breakdown by Region Employee Breakdown by LOB and Corporate\nRegion Employees LOB Employees\nNorth America 178,599 CCB 135,347\nAsia-Pacific 82,696 CIB 73,452\nEurope/Middle East/Africa 27,514 CB 14,687\nLatin America/Caribbean 4,914 AWM 26,041\nTotal Firm 293,723 Corporate 44,196\nTotal Firm 293,723\nDiversity, equity and inclusion\nIn connection with its diversity initiatives, the Firm periodically requests that its employees and Board members self-identify based on specified diversity categories. The following table presents information on self-identifications as of December 31, 2022. Information on race/ethnicity of employees is categorized based on Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) classifications and is presented for U.S. employees who self-identified, and information on gender is presented for global employees who self-identified.

The Firm maintains its focus on its culture of inclusion and respect, which is reinforced by its Code of Conduct and by increasing employee awareness, education, communication and training. An important part of these efforts includes the Firms Business Resource Groups, which are groups of employees who support JPMorgan Chases diversity, equity and inclusion strategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of their members. The Firm has global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence that lead the Firms strategy in supporting its commitments to create more equity and lasting impact in communities, and strengthen its inclusive culture.\nAttracting and retaining employees\nThe goal of JPMorgan Chases recruitment efforts is to attract and hire talented individuals in all roles and at all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both external candidates and internal employees who are seeking a different role with challenging and stimulating career opportunities. These opportunities range from internship training programs for students to entry-level, management and executive careers. During 2022, approximately two-thirds of the Firms employment opportunities were filled by external candidates, with the remainder filled by existing employees. In addition, depending on business needs, and where appropriate, the Firm has implemented hybrid work models which include a mix of on-site and remote work for certain roles.\nDiversity is an important area of focus throughout the Firms hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including initiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic groups, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, veterans and others. The Firms global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion centers of excellence seek to increase representation of and advance career opportunities for talented diverse individuals across the Firm through initiatives such as career coaching and mentorship.\nJPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program that seeks to attract accomplished individuals who have taken a career break and wish to return to the workforce. In addition, and where appropriate, the Firms hiring practices focus on the skills of a job candidate rather than degrees held.\nDeveloping employees\nJPMorgan Chase supports the professional development and career growth of its employees. An onboarding training curriculum is required for new hires, which covers, among other topics, compliance with the Firms Code of Conduct and information concerning Firm policies and standards,\nincluding those relating to cybersecurity. In addition, the Firm offers extensive training programs and educational resources to all employees, covering a broad variety of topics such as leadership, change management, analytical thinking, culture and conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion, and risk and controls. Leadership Edge, the Firms global leadership and management development center of excellence, is focused on creating one Firmwide leadership culture.\nCompensation and benefits\nThe Firm provides market-competitive compensation and benefits programs. JPMorgan Chases compensation philosophy includes guiding principles that drive compensation-related decisions across the Firm, and includes: pay-for-performance practices designed to attract and retain top talent; responsiveness and alignment with shareholder interests; and reinforcement of the Firms culture and How We Do Business Principles, including the integration of risk, controls and conduct considerations. The Firms commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for all employees includes compensation review processes that seek to ensure that the Firms employees are paid equitably and competitively for the work they do.\nThe Firm also supports employees well-being. JPMorgan Chase offers an extensive benefits and wellness package to employees and their families, including healthcare coverage, retirement benefits, life and disability insurance, on-site health and wellness centers, counseling and resources related to mental health, employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, backup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement programs, and financial coaching. In 2022, the Firm implemented or announced enhancements to certain health and wellness benefits for U.S. employees, including expanded medical plan coverage and paid time off policies related to parental, critical caregiving and bereavement leaves.\nPart I\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) under U.S. federal law, and is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). The Federal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the consolidated operations of BHCs. Certain of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries are also regulated directly by additional authorities based on the activities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chases national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and, with respect to certain matters, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC).\nJPMorgan Chases U.S. broker-dealers are supervised and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Subsidiaries of the Firm that engage in certain futures-related and swaps-related activities are supervised and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). J.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank regulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nJPMSE is a Germany-based credit institution regulated by the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as the local regulators in each of the countries in which it operates. The Firms other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated by the banking, securities, prudential and conduct regulatory authorities, as applicable, in the countries in which they operate.\nPermissible business activities. The Bank Holding Company Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely-related activities. FHCs are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial activities. The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHCs ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements. The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if deficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture of the FHCs depository institutions. If any depository institution controlled by an FHC fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit the FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any new activities other than\nthose permissible for BHCs, or acquiring a company engaged in such activities.\nCapital and liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage requirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally consistent with the international Basel III capital and liquidity framework and evaluates the Firms compliance with those requirements. The OCC establishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Certain of the Firms non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local capital and liquidity requirements.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and enhance the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. U.S. banking regulators have announced their support for the issuance of the Basel III reforms and are considering how to appropriately apply such reforms in the U.S.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104.\nStress tests. As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is subject to supervisory stress testing administered by the Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework. The Firm must conduct annual company-run stress tests and must also submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine the Firms Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement for the coming year, which forms part of the Firms applicable capital buffers. The Firm is required to file its annual CCAR submission on April 5, 2023. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of its indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2023 and final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023. The Firms final SCB requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023. The OCC requires JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar stress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year the results of the annual stress tests for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory severely adverse scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve and the OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for more information concerning the Firms CCAR.\nEnhanced prudential standards. As part of its mandate to identify and monitor risks to the financial stability of the U.S. posed by large banking organizations, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) recommends prudential standards and reporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve has adopted several rules to implement those heightened prudential standards, including rules relating to risk management and corporate governance of subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under these rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk\nmanagement standards, including oversight by the board of directors of risk management activities.\nResolution and recovery. The Firm is required to maintain a comprehensive recovery plan, updated annually, summarizing the actions it would take to remain well-capitalized and well-funded in order to avoid failure in the case of an adverse event. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to prepare and submit a recovery plan as directed by the OCC. The Firm is required to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of material distress or failure (a resolution plan). In 2019, the FDIC and Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing resolution plan requirements, and on the basis of those revisions, the Firms resolution plan submissions will alternate between targeted and full plans. The Firms targeted resolution plan was filed on June 28, 2021, and the Firm's next \"full\" resolution plan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to prepare and submit a separate resolution plan as directed by the FDIC on or before December 1, 2023.\nCertain of the Firms non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches are also subject to local resolution and recovery planning requirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority. Certain financial companies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its subsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution under an orderly liquidation authority. The U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the President of the United States, must first make certain determinations concerning extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk, and action must be recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. Absent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain subject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing its single point of entry strategy for resolution of SIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which seeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support those subsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the Federal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions. Acquisitions by BHCs and their banks are subject to requirements, limitations and prohibitions established by law and by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For example, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before they acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an unaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by financial companies are prohibited if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore, for certain acquisitions, the Firm must\nprovide written notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company with over $10 billion in assets that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature. Moreover, while FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities (including acquisitions) than BHCs, the Federal Reserve has the authority to limit an FHCs ability to conduct otherwise permissible acquisitions if the FHC or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements.\nOngoing obligations. The Firm is subject to obligations under the terms of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into with the Department of Justice on September 29, 2020 relating to precious metals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations as well as under a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the Firms principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those specifically authorized under the National Bank Act and related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has authority to bring an enforcement action against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound banking practices, which could include limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities, or imposing corrective capital or managerial requirements on the bank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance fund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits and is funded through assessments on banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon any insolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC could be appointed as conservator or receiver under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad powers to transfer assets and liabilities without the approval of the institutions creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is also authorized to take appropriate action against the parent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the undercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In certain instances, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established guidelines setting forth heightened standards for large banks, including minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks. Under these standards, a banks risk governance framework must ensure that the banks risk profile is easily distinguished and separate from that of its parent BHC for risk management purposes. The banks board or risk\nPart I\ncommittee is responsible for approving the banks risk governance framework, providing active oversight of the banks risk-taking activities, and holding management accountable for adhering to the risk governance framework.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, investments in stock or securities of, and derivatives, securities lending and certain other transactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain other affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from such subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in specified amounts and comply with certain other requirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks, such as JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the amount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. could pay, at January 1, 2023, to JPMorgan Chase without the approval of the banking regulators. The OCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank subsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of a receiver of an insured depositary institution (IDI) for administrative expense and the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches that are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S. branch) have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution, including depositors in non-U.S. branches and public noteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction over small business lending activities with respect to fair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As part of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has authority to take enforcement actions against firms that offer certain products and services to consumers using practices that are deemed to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. In February 2023, the CFPB proposed a rule that would significantly reduce and limit the late payment fees that credit card issuers, including the Firm, would be permitted to charge to customers. The Firms consumer activities are also subject to regulation under state statutes which are enforced by the Attorney General or empowered agency of each state.\nIn the U.K., the Firm operates a retail bank through J.P. Morgan Europe Limited (JPMEL) and provides retail investment management services through Nutmeg Saving\nand Investment Limited (Nutmeg). JPMEL is regulated by the PRA, and both JPMEL and Nutmeg are regulated by the FCA with respect to their conduct of financial services in the U.K., including obligations relating to the fair treatment of customers. JPMEL is also regulated by the U.K. Payment Systems Regulator with respect to its operation and use of payment systems. In addition, the retail businesses of JPMEL and Nutmeg are subject to U.K. consumer-protection legislation.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer subsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange, among others. The Firm conducts similar securities activities outside the U.S. subject to local regulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities are conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-dealers are subject to laws and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, securities offerings, publication of research reports, use of customer funds, the financing of client purchases, capital structure, record-keeping and retention, and the conduct of their directors, officers and employees. Refer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 96 for information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firms asset and wealth management businesses are subject to significant regulation in jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding and management of client assets, offerings of funds and marketing activities. Certain of the Firms subsidiaries are registered with, and subject to oversight by, the SEC as investment advisers and broker-dealers. The Firms registered investment advisers in the United States are subject to the fiduciary and other obligations imposed under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and applicable state and federal law. The Firms bank fiduciary activities are subject to supervision by the OCC.\nDerivatives regulation:\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its derivatives businesses, including regulations that impose capital and margin requirements, require central clearing of standardized over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized OTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and provide for reporting of certain mandated information. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. In addition, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are registered with the SEC as security-based swap dealers. As a result, these entities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their swap or security-based swap activities, including capital requirements, rules requiring the collateralization of uncleared swaps and security-based swaps, rules regarding\nsegregation of counterparty collateral, business conduct and documentation standards, record-keeping and reporting obligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation requirements. Similar requirements have also been established under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the National Futures Association.\nData, privacy and cybersecurity regulation:\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations globally concerning data, including data protection, consumer protection, privacy, cybersecurity and related matters. These laws, rules and regulations are constantly evolving, subject to interpretation, remain a focus of regulators globally, may be enforced by private parties or government bodies, and will continue to have a significant impact on all of the Firms businesses and operations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requires all financial institutions, including banks and securities broker-dealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-keeping and reporting requirements, as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. The Firm is also subject to the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and EU and U.K. authorities which target entities or individuals that are, or are located in countries that are, involved in activities including terrorism, hostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.

The Federal Reserve has jointly issued guidance with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to ensure that incentive compensation paid by banking organizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking that threatens the organizations safety and soundness. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has also established standards covering compensation principles for banks. The Firms compensation practices are also subject to regulation and oversight by regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the Fifth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V), as implemented in the EU and as adopted in the U.K, which includes compensation-related provisions. The European Banking Authority has instituted guidelines on compensation policies including under CRD V which in certain countries, such as Germany, are implemented or supplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The U.K. regulators have also instituted guidelines on CRD V compensation policies. The Firm expects that the implementation of regulatory guidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and other countries will continue to evolve, and may affect the manner in which the Firm structures its compensation programs and practices.\nOther significant international regulatory initiatives:\nPolicymakers in the U.K. and EU continue to implement a program of regulatory enhancements relating to financial services, several key elements of which are discussed below.\nMiFID II requires the trading of shares and certain standardized OTC derivatives to take place on specified trading venues. MiFID II also significantly enhanced requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency, transaction reporting and investor protection, and introduced a position limits and reporting regime for commodities. In November 2021, the European Commission (EC) published a draft legislative proposal for amendments to MiFID II focused on changes to rules related to transparency and market structure, including the proposed creation of a consolidated tape intended to increase transparency into trading across the EU by providing a centralized source of market data. This legislation remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.\nIn the U.K., MiFID II is being amended through the Wholesale Markets Review, a set of proposals designed to streamline and improve regulation of the U.K. secondary markets following the U.K.s departure from the EU. Some of the changes, such as the removal of the requirement to execute trades in shares on certain trading venues, have been introduced through the Financial Services and Markets Bill (FSMB), which is expected to be passed by the U.K. Parliament in the first half of 2023. Other changes, such as amendments to MiFID II rules related to transparency, will be subject to further consultation, which is expected during 2023.\nPart I\nIn December 2022, the EC published a legislative proposal to amend EMIR to increase the competitiveness of the EU central clearing framework and to enhance supervision of EU central counterparties (CCPs). These proposals are subject to further review by the European Parliament and European Council.\nThe EU has adopted mandatory buy-in rules under the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) which will impose requirements relating to sourcing of securities in the event of a settlement fail. In June 2022, EU regulators proposed an amendment to postpone the application of these rules until November 2025. The amendment remains subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council.\nIn December 2022, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extensive package of reforms to U.K. financial services regulation known as the Edinburgh Reforms. These reforms aim to drive growth and competitiveness in the U.K. financial services sector following the U.K.s departure from the EU. The reform package includes initiatives relating to a number of areas of financial services policy, including retail banks, payments, markets, digital assets and sustainable finance. The U.K. Government and regulators are expected to release further consultations and announcements related to these reforms in 2023.\nEU and U.K. regulators are expected to finalize the rules implementing the Basel III framework during 2023. The Firms banking entities in the EU and the U.K. will be required to comply with the Basel III final rules by January 2025, allowing for certain transitional arrangements until 2030 and 2032, respectively. The main changes implemented by the Basel III final rules will be revisions to the credit risk and operational risk calculation methods to reduce the use of and reliance on internal modelling approaches and introduce internationally-agreed changes to the market risk framework. The EU Basel III final rules also strengthen enforcement tools for supervisors overseeing EU banks and require EU banking entities to systematically identify, disclose and manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks as part of their risk management practices. In addition, in December 2022, the European Banking Authority (EBA) announced that it will publish rules and technical standards between 2023 and 2025 related to sustainable finance, which will be applicable to EU banks. The Firms banking entities in the U.K. will be required to comply with regulatory policies and standards related to climate risk being developed by the PRA. In addition, EU legislation requires that certain non-EU banks operating in the EU establish an intermediate parent undertaking (IPU) located in the EU. The IPU legislation allows a second IPU to be established if a single IPU would conflict with home country bank separation rules or impede resolvability. The Firm will be required to comply with the EUs IPU requirements by December 30, 2023.\nThe Firms banking entities in the EU and U.K. are also subject to supervisory expectations published by the ECB\nand the PRA, respectively, for management of financial risks arising from climate change and the increasing operational reliance on IT systems, third-party services and innovative technologies, as well as supervisory expectations for operational resilience and resilience from macro-financial and geopolitical shocks. These expectations address bank strategy, governance, risk management, scenario analysis, risk reporting and disclosure.\nPolicymakers in the EU have continued to implement sustainability-related initiatives. In December 2022, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The CSRD will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of ESG reporting requirements under the EUs existing ESG reporting rules. CSRD reporting requirements will be phased in beginning in 2024. In addition, the EC published its legislative proposal on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) in February 2022. The draft directive sets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities of companies with which they have established business relationships. The proposed legislation may also require the adoption of company-specific climate-related transition plans. The CSDDD is currently subject to review by the European Parliament and European Council. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will apply to certain of the Firms EU entities as well as to certain non-EU entities. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.\nSummary\nThe principal risk factors that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation include:\nRegulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and supervised financial services industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chases business and operations; the ways in which differences in financial services regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can negatively impact JPMorgan Chases business; the penalties and collateral consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorgan Chase may incur when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain countries can negatively impact JPMorgan Chases operations and financial results; and the losses that security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution.\nPolitical risks, including the potential negative effects on JPMorgan Chases businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments.\nMarket risks, including the effects that economic and market events and conditions, governmental policies, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chases consumer and wholesale businesses and its investment and market-making positions and on JPMorgan Chases earnings and its liquidity and capital levels.\nCredit risks, including potential negative effects from adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and central counterparties; and the potential for losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions or from concentrations of credit and market risk.\nLiquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chases liquidity could be impaired by market-wide\nilliquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of funding; and potential negative impacts, including litigation risks, associated with the transition to alternative reference rates.\nCapital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorgan Chases ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activities.\nOperational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chases dependence on its operational systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market participants and service providers; the potential negative effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms; legal and regulatory risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other extraordinary events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chases risk management framework, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its stress testing and financial statements, and controls over disclosure and financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers.\nStrategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chases competitive standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chases business operations, clients and customers.\nConduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the actions or misconduct of employees, including any failure of employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chases expectations, policies and practices.\nReputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chases relationships with its clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk\nPart I\nmanagement, compliance or operational failures, litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to satisfy expectations concerning environmental, social and governance concerns, failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations, or other factors that could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nCountry risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan Chases businesses from an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region; and the potential adverse effects of local economic, political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chases business and revenues in certain countries.\nPeople risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chases workforce.\nLegal risks, including those relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.\nThe above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.\nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chases businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chases entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.\nIn response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:\nlimit the products and services that it offers\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue\npay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations\nincur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities, or\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.\nAny failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:\nincreased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny\nregulatory and governmental enforcement actions\nthe imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions\nincreased exposure to litigation, or\nharm to its reputation.\nDifferences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation can negatively impact JPMorgan Chases businesses, operations and financial results.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny\nfinancial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For\nexample, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nIn addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nto implement processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements\nthe separation (or ring fencing) of core banking products and services from markets activities\nthe resolution of financial institutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (CCPs)\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nabsorb increased capital and liquidity costs\nincur higher operational and compliance costs\nchange the prices that it charges for its products and services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients\ncurtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued\nbecome subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chases businesses, results of operations and profitability.\nResolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to JPMorgan Chases reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:\nloss of clients, customers and business\nrestrictions on offering certain products or services, and\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\nPart I\nit and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions\ngovernmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and\ngovernmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:\nenter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions\npay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nJPMorgan Chases operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nJPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions\nconflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive\nthe threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal principles in other parts of the world, and\nthe termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.\nIf the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies evaluation of JPMorgan Chases resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chases growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations and strategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the Parent Company) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (eligible LTD) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chases operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (Title II).\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe preferred single point of entry strategy under JPMorgan Chases resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Companys losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Companys equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chases preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chases preferred strategy.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chases businesses.\nPolitical developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending\nactions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken\ngovernmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more generally, the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, and the management of climate and ESG-related risks\nisolationist foreign policies\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities\neconomic or financial sanctions\nthe implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or\nother governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.\nThese types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:\nerode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency\nprovoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations\nlead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the U.S. GSEs)\nincrease concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time\nPart I\nresult in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries\nincrease investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole\nadversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or\ncause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.\nThese factors could lead to:\nslower growth rates, rising inflation or recession\ngreater market volatility\na contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads\nerosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets\ndiminished investor and consumer confidence\nlower investment growth\nlarge-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries\nreduced commercial activity among trading partners\nthe potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country\nthe possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty\npotential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or\nother market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.\nAny of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.\nJPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental authorities that:\nseek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or\nmandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.\nBecause governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:\nrestrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction\nthe threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and\nharm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or association with certain social and environmental industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.\nMarket\nEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and investment and market-making positions.\nJPMorgan Chases results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:\ninvestor, consumer and business sentiment\nevents that reduce confidence in the financial markets\ninflation, deflation or recession\nhigh unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market\nthe availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit\nlevels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility\nthe economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chases control, and\nthe strength of the U.S. and global economies.\nAll of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chases investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:\nsevere declines in asset values\nunexpected credit events\nunforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)\nthe inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or\nother market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.\nIf JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chases profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chases consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.\nJPMorgan Chases consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:\npersonal and household income distribution\nunemployment or underemployment\nprolonged periods of exceptionally low or high interest rates\nhousing prices\nthe level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services\nconsumer and small business confidence levels, and\nchanges in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.\nHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chases earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding\nstudent loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chases earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chases wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chases capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or\nPart I\nholds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chases revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.\nAn economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chases wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chases earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chases wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chases earnings from its wholesale businesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorgan Chases earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels.\nWhen interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients\nthe loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior\nlosses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities held in the investment securities portfolio\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chases consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\nOn the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chases broader asset and liability management strategy, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chases mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chases credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chases credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chases earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chases results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their\ncurrent fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chases risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chases exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chases hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.\nAs part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chases operational and\nlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.\nTransactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chases ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chases ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chases businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chases credit risk may be further increased when:\nJPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant\nPart I\nmarket stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chases credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chases borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.\nJPMorgan Chases consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the\nU.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chases consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (RWA) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chases ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chases liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market participant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chases liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chases funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the IHC). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company.\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chases management or Board of Directors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding companys ability to:\npay interest on its debt securities\npay dividends on its equity securities\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:\nexpected future profitability\nrisk management practices\nlegal expenses\nratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\nregulatory developments\nassumptions about government support, and\neconomic and geopolitical developments.\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chases credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chases options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chases business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.\nThe transition to alternative reference rates could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or litigation and other disputes.\nRegulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain interest rate indices that are deemed to be benchmarks, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that:\nany of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace\narrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or\na particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates.\nPart I\nFor example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are still linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) benchmark, and significant progress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if market participants have not implemented effective operational and other arrangements to address the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chases results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has:\ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments\nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest\nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates\nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or\ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chases ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically\nImportant Bank (GSIB), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:\nactions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations\nactions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge\nchanges in the composition of JPMorgan Chases balance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and\nincreases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chases SCB.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chases shareholders, such as:\nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase\nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chases capital management strategy\nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or\ncurtailing JPMorgan Chases business activities or operations.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.\nJPMorgan Chases businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chases financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective\nfunctioning of JPMorgan Chases operational systems depends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and\nthe ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adherence to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties, including its custodians, vendors (such as those that provide data and cloud computing services, and security and technology services) and other market participants (such as clearing and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges).\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information to clients and customers\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required\nfailure to timely settle or confirm transactions\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chases products and services\nlimitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data as required in connection with regulatory or other investigations\nregulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chases operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and\nthird parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chases operational systems, or those of newly-acquired businesses or of external parties on which JPMorgan Chases businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, hacktivists (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as malware, into JPMorgan Chases systems. These attacks are often designed to:\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chases systems\nPart I\nsteal money, or\nextort money through the use of so-called ransomware.\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced:\nsignificant distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt online banking services and other business activities, and\na higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chases systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chases own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as:\nJPMorgan Chases ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services\nthe acquisition and integration of new businesses, and\nthe increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees.\nIn addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or\ncommunications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chases employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chases systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems\nmisappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chases systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chases cybersecurity and business resiliency measures\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chases clients, customers or counterparties\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chases ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chases ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and customers\nincreased operating expenses\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions\ndamage to JPMorgan Chases reputation\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chases liquidity\nregulatory intervention, or\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations.\nJPMorgan Chases operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chases customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chases operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chases security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chases systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could\nresult in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:\nheightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chases systems\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations\nincreased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external partys security breach, and\nreputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chases systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chases interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chases clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chases operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chases ability to conduct business.\nJPMorgan Chases business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.\nJPMorgan Chases ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan Chases businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:\nthe ineffective implementation of business decisions\nPart I\nany failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls\nstaffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets\nthe possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chases workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics\na significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or\nother negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chases businesses or operations depend.\nJPMorgan Chases operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.\nJPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information.\nJPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in\nfines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.\nImplementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chases collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:\nincrease JPMorgan Chases compliance and operating costs\nhinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers\ndemand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management, and\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.\nNot all of JPMorgan Chases clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:\nerroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chases use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chases delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chases development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.\nJPMorgan Chases operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.\nJPMorgan Chases business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:\ncyber attacks\nsecurity breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety\npower, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit\nfailure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data\ndamage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase\neffects of climate change\nnatural disasters or severe weather conditions\naccidents such as explosions or structural failures\nhealth emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or\nevents arising from local or larger-scale civil or political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.\nJPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chases ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chases business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting.\nAny significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chases operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:\nhinder JPMorgan Chases ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event\ncause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries\ndisrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chases businesses rely\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm its reputation.\nEnhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chases failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:\npotential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues\nincreased operational costs, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nJPMorgan Chases risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chases risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:\nPart I\nhinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chases senior management and Board of Directors\nlead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase\nrequire significant resources and time to remediate\nlead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations\nattract heightened regulatory scrutiny\nexpose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nlead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated with that harm\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting.\nMany of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on managements subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chases risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP).\nThese models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically\nreviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity\nsudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.\nJPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment.\nSimilarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chases clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing\nrisks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chases regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chases models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chases profitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chases disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business and results of operations or financial condition\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\nrequire it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chases management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chases competitive standing and results could suffer.\nJPMorgan Chases business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe businesses that it acquires or in which it invests\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers,\ninvestors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chases businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chases growth prospects also depend on managements ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Managements effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chases ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations\nconduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or investments, or effectively integrate newly-acquired businesses\nappropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chases businesses.\nFurthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:\nother banks and financial institutions\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\nfinance companies\nPart I\ntechnology companies, and\nother nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorgan Chase.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chases costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chases products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chases businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chases ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chases revenues. Increased competition also\nmay require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.\nThe effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its business, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgans clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.\nClimate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks include:\ndeclines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property\nreduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase\ninterruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and\npopulation migration or unemployment in affected regions.\nTransition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Potential adverse impacts of transition risks include:\nsudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (stranded assets)\nincreased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy\nincreased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as higher taxation and accelerated decarbonization policies\nnegative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and\ndamage to JPMorgan Chases reputation, including due to any perception that its business practices are\ncontrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders.\nClimate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulation is implemented in the many regions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chases reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.\nJPMorgan Chases employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chases Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chases commitment to do first class business in a first class way. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employees life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chases promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.\nJPMorgan Chases reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chases expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chases products or services\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs\nfacilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the\nproposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants\nusing electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chases goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chases risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and\nmisappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chases expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:\nfinancial losses\nincreased operational and compliance costs\ngreater scrutiny by regulators and other parties\nregulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities\nthe need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chases management\nloss of clients or customers, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nThe foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.\nReputation\nDamage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could harm its businesses.\nMaintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chases\nPart I\nbusiness and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chases goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace\nsecurity breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks\nfailure to safeguard client, customer or employee information\nfailure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies\nfailure to meet publicly-announced commitments to support ESG initiatives\nnon-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations\noperational failures\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions\nactions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency, spread of infectious disease, epidemic or pandemic\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and\nfailure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.\nJPMorgan Chases reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies :\nwhose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or\nwhose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers rights or communities.\nActivists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan Chases business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan Chases headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chases shareholders.\nThese and other types of activist criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its business activities. In all of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation could:\nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase\nimpair JPMorgan Chases ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers\ndiminish JPMorgan Chases ability to hire or retain employees\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers\ncause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\notherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations.\nActions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chases reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or\na financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nJPMorgan Chases ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chases clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:\nadequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction\nidentify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\ntreat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or\nhandle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations.\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chases reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chases businesses within the affected region or globally.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:\nworldwide economic disruption\nheightened volatility in financial markets\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region\ndisruption of global trade, and\ndiminished consumer, business and investor confidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chases operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.\nJPMorgan Chases business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth, and\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chases operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including:\nwidespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes\ncrime and corruption\nPart I\nsecurity and personal safety issues\nan outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities\noverthrow of incumbent governments\nterrorist attacks, and\nother forms of internal discord.\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chases operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.\nJPMorgan Chases employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chases performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nJPMorgan Chases increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain employees.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to\nmake structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chases business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chases businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chases reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chases profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chases exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.

Refer to Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 155.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%.\n-Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B common shares (Visa B shares) in Corporate.\nNoninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and continued investments in the business, including compensation, technology and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenue-related expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting:\n-a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and\n-$2.9 billion of net charge-offs.\nThe prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, reflecting a net reduction to the allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, compared with 1.62% in the prior year.\nThe Firms nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales.\nFirmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting:\n-growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by the impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and\n-reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the rising interest rate environment.\nSelected capital and other metrics\nCET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively.\nSLR was 5.6%.\nTBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had average eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) of approximately $733 billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $694 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity sources.

Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chases management, speak only as of the date of this Form 10-K, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on page 154, and the Risk Factors section on pages 9-32 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chases actual results to differ materially because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook information set forth below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nJPMorgan Chases current outlook for full-year 2023 should be viewed against the backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the geopolitical environment, the competitive environment, client and customer activity levels, and regulatory and legislative developments in the U.S. and other countries where the Firm does business. Each of these factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to its businesses and operations in response to ongoing developments in the business, economic, regulatory and legal environments in which it operates.\nFull-year 2023\nManagement expects net interest income to be approximately $73 billion, market dependent.\nManagement expects net interest income excluding Markets to be approximately $74 billion, market dependent.\nManagement expects adjusted expense to be approximately $81 billion, market dependent.\nManagement expects the net charge-off rate in Card Services to be approximately 2.6%.\nNet interest income excluding Markets and adjusted expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firms Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 58-60.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nBusiness Developments\nWar in Ukraine\nThe duration and potential outcomes of the war in Ukraine remain uncertain. The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures connected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.\nThe Firms exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse effects on the Firms businesses.\nThe Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional information.\nFor purposes of this Form 10-K, Russia refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firms internal country risk management framework; and Russia-associated refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia.\nInterbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition\nThe Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final stages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other IBORs in accordance with the International Organization of Securities Commissions standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (LIBOR Cessation) is scheduled for June 30, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry milestones and recommendations published by National Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firms remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central counterparties (CCPs) to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate approximately 40% of the Firms remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly through contractual fallback provisions.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (LIBOR Act) was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month, three-month and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a synthetic basis which would allow market participants to use such rates through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of synthetic LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.\nThe Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk management systems in connection with the transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 153 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section provides a comparative discussion of JPMorgan Chases Consolidated Results of Operations on a reported basis for the two-year period ended December 31, 2022, unless otherwise specified.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses consisted of:\n$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and\n$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.\nThe prior year included a $12.1 billion net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\nDeterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.\nNet charge-offs were $2.9 billion, flat compared with 2021, and included:\na $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,\noffset by\na $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and Banking & Wealth Management (BWM) as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and an increase of $76 million in CIB.\nRefer to the segment discussions of CCB on pages 63-66, CIB on pages 67-72, CB on pages 73-75, AWM on pages 76-78, the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, and Notes 1, 10 and 13 for further discussion of the credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nNoninterest expense\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCompensation expense $ 41,636 $ 38,567 $ 34,988\nNoncompensation expense:\nOccupancy 4,696 4,516 4,449\nTechnology, communications and equipment(a)\n9,358 9,941 10,338\nProfessional and outside services\n10,174 9,814 8,464\nMarketing 3,911 3,036 2,476\nOther(b)\n6,365 5,469 5,941\nTotal noncompensation expense\n34,504 32,776 31,668\nTotal noninterest expense\n$ 76,140 $ 71,343 $ 66,656\n(a)Includes depreciation expense associated with auto operating lease assets.\n(b)Included Firmwide legal expense of $266 million, $426 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n2022 compared with 2021\nCompensation expense increased driven by additional headcount, primarily in technology and operations, as well as front office, and the impact of inflation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.\nNoncompensation expense increased as a result of:\nhigher investments in the business, including marketing and technology, and\nhigher structural expense, including travel and entertainment; regulatory assessments; occupancy expense associated with higher utilities and exit costs of certain leases; and other employee-related expense,\npartially offset by\nlower volume-related expense, reflecting lower depreciation expense on lower Auto lease assets; and lower distribution fees in AWM, partially offset by higher operating losses and outside services, both in CCB; and\nlower legal expense.\nThe prior year included a $550 million contribution to the Firm's Foundation.\nIncome tax expense\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions, except rate)\n2022 2021 2020\nIncome before income tax expense\n$ 46,166 $ 59,562 $ 35,815\nIncome tax expense 8,490 11,228 6,684\nEffective tax rate 18.4 % 18.9 % 18.7 %\n2022 compared with 2021\nThe effective tax rate decreased driven by income tax benefits compared with income tax expense in the prior year related to tax audit settlements, largely offset by other tax adjustments and a change in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes.

impact of the transfer of $78.3 billion of securities from AFS to HTM in 2022, for capital management purposes.\nThe decrease in AFS securities was also due to paydowns, as well as unrealized losses, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI),\nlargely offset by net purchases, and\nthe increase in HTM securities also reflected purchases partially offset by paydowns.\nRefer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80, Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 130 and Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on investment securities.\nLoans increased, reflecting:\nhigher balances in Card Services driven by higher consumer spending and net new originations,\nhigher originations and revolver utilization in CB, and\nhigher wholesale loans in CIB,\npartially offset by\nlower mortgage warehouse loans in Home Lending as sales outpaced originations due to higher interest rates, and\nthe impact from PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.\nThe allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a net addition of $3.3 billion to the allowance for loan losses, consisting of:\n$2.1 billion in wholesale, resulting from deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook, and loan growth predominantly in CB and CIB, and\n$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.\nIn 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets.\nIn 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities.\nInvesting activities\nThe Firms investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.\nIn 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities.\nIn 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements.\nFinancing activities\nThe Firms financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.\nIn 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.\nIn 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.\nFor both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.\n* * *\nRefer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 163 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firms cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRMS USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 159-163. That presentation, which is referred to as reported basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firms results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firms performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firms results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a managed basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firms definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firms reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios) Reported Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis Reported Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis Reported Fully taxable-equivalent adjustments(a)\nManaged\nbasis\nOther income $ 4,322 $ 3,148 $ 7,470 $ 4,830 $ 3,225 $ 8,055 $ 4,865 $ 2,560 $ 7,425\nTotal noninterest revenue 61,985 3,148 65,133 69,338 3,225 72,563 65,388 2,560 67,948\nNet interest income 66,710 434 67,144 52,311 430 52,741 54,563 418 54,981\nTotal net revenue 128,695 3,582 132,277 121,649 3,655 125,304 119,951 2,978 122,929\nTotal noninterest expense 76,140 NA 76,140 71,343 NA 71,343 66,656 NA 66,656\nPre-provision profit 52,555 3,582 56,137 50,306 3,655 53,961 53,295 2,978 56,273\nProvision for credit losses 6,389 NA 6,389 (9,256) NA (9,256) 17,480 NA 17,480\nIncome before income tax expense 46,166 3,582 49,748 59,562 3,655 63,217 35,815 2,978 38,793\nIncome tax expense 8,490 3,582 12,072 11,228 3,655 14,883 6,684 2,978 9,662\nNet income $ 37,676 NA $ 37,676 $ 48,334 NA $ 48,334 $ 29,131 NA $ 29,131\nOverhead ratio 59 % NM 58 % 59 % NM 57 % 56 % NM 54 %\n(a)Predominantly recognized in CIB, CB and Corporate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNet interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding CIB Markets\nIn addition to reviewing net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets, as shown below. CIB Markets consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. These metrics, which exclude CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews these metrics to assess the performance of the Firms lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with CIB Markets activities. In addition, management also assesses CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue basis as offsets may occur across revenue lines. Management believes that these measures provide investors and analysts with alternative measures to analyze the revenue trends of the Firm.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions, except rates) 2022 2021 2020\nNet interest income - reported $ 66,710 $ 52,311 $ 54,563\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments 434 430 418\nNet interest income - managed basis(a)\n$ 67,144 $ 52,741 $ 54,981\nLess: Markets net interest income(b)\n4,789 8,243 8,374\nNet interest income excluding Markets(a)\n$ 62,355 $ 44,498 $ 46,607\nAverage interest-earning assets $ 3,349,079 $ 3,215,942 $ 2,779,710\nLess: Average Markets interest-earning assets(b)\n953,195 888,238 751,131\nAverage interest-earning assets excluding Markets $ 2,395,884 $ 2,327,704 $ 2,028,579\nNet yield on average interest-earning assets - managed basis 2.00 % 1.64 % 1.98 %\nNet yield on average Markets interest-earning assets(b)\n0.50 0.93 1.11\nNet yield on average interest-earning assets excluding Markets 2.60 % 1.91 % 2.30 %\nNoninterest revenue - reported $ 61,985 $ 69,338 $ 65,388\nFully taxable-equivalent adjustments 3,148 3,225 2,560\nNoninterest revenue - managed basis $ 65,133 $ 72,563 67,948\nLess: Markets noninterest revenue(b)\n24,195 19,151 21,109\nNoninterest revenue excluding Markets $ 40,938 $ 53,412 $ 46,839\nMemo: Total Markets net revenue(b)\n$ 28,984 $ 27,394 $ 29,483\n(a)Interest includes the effect of related hedges.

TCE represents the Firms common stockholders equity (i.e., total stockholders equity less preferred stock) less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firms net income applicable to common equity as a percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firms TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Firms use of equity.\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firms common stockholders equity to TCE.\nPeriod-end Average\nDec 31,\n2022 Dec 31,\n2021 Year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share and ratio data) 2022 2021 2020\nCommon stockholders equity\n$ 264,928 $ 259,289 $ 253,068 $ 250,968 $ 236,865\nLess: Goodwill 51,662 50,315 50,952 49,584 47,820\nLess: Other intangible assets\n1,224 882 1,112 876 781\nAdd: Certain deferred tax liabilities(a)\n2,510 2,499 2,505 2,474 2,399\nTangible common equity $ 214,552 $ 210,591 $ 203,509 $ 202,982 $ 190,663\nReturn on tangible common equity NA NA 18 % 23 % 14 %\nTangible book value per share $ 73.12 $ 71.53 NA NA NA\n(a)Represents deferred tax liabilities related to tax-deductible goodwill and to identifiable intangibles created in nontaxable transactions, which are netted against goodwill and other intangibles when calculating TCE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firms Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firms use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60 for a definition of managed basis.\nJPMorgan Chase\nConsumer Businesses Wholesale Businesses\nConsumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset & Wealth Management\nBanking &\nWealth Management(a)\nHome Lending Card Services & Auto(b)\nBanking Markets &\nSecurities Services Middle Market Banking\nAsset Management\nConsumer Banking\nJ.P.

The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firms LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firms clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (FTP) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.\nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for additional information.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segments net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a\nbusiness segments net income applicable to common equity.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. The Firms allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Risk-weighted assets (RWA), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically important banks (GSIB) surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of updates to the Firms capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information on capital allocation.\nSegment Results - Managed Basis\nThe following tables summarize the Firms results by segment for the periods indicated.\nYear ended December 31, Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking\n(in millions, except ratios) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nTotal net revenue $ 55,017 $ 50,073 $ 51,268 $ 47,899 $ 51,749 $ 49,284 $ 11,533 $ 10,008 $ 9,313\nTotal noninterest expense 31,471 29,256 27,990 27,087 25,325 23,538 4,719 4,041 3,798\nPre-provision profit/(loss) 23,546 20,817 23,278 20,812 26,424 25,746 6,814 5,967 5,515\nProvision for credit losses 3,813 (6,989) 12,312 1,158 (1,174) 2,726 1,268 (947) 2,113\nNet income/(loss) 14,871 20,930 8,217 14,970 21,134 17,094 4,213 5,246 2,578\nReturn on equity (ROE) 29% 41% 15% 14 % 25% 20% 16 % 21% 11%\nYear ended December 31, Asset & Wealth Management Corporate Total\n(in millions, except ratios) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nTotal net revenue $ 17,748 $ 16,957 $ 14,240 $ 80 $ (3,483) $ (1,176) $ 132,277 $ 125,304 $ 122,929\nTotal noninterest expense 11,829 10,919 9,957 1,034 1,802 1,373 76,140 71,343 66,656\nPre-provision profit/(loss) 5,919 6,038 4,283 (954) (5,285) (2,549) 56,137 53,961 56,273\nProvision for credit losses 128 (227) 263 22 81 66 6,389 (9,256) 17,480\nNet income/(loss) 4,365 4,737 2,992 (743) (3,713) (1,750) 37,676 48,334 29,131\nReturn on equity (ROE) 25 % 33% 28% NM NM NM 14% 19% 12%\nSelected Firmwide Metrics\nThe following tables present key metrics for Wealth Management, which consists of the Global Private Bank in AWM and J.P.

The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.\n-Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion, down 43%, due to lower issuance activity.\n-Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a lower level of announced deals.\nPayments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees on higher volumes.\nLending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by higher net interest income primarily on higher loans, as well as fair value gains on hedges of retained loans, compared with losses in the prior year.\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up 2%. Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 10%, driven by strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.\nEquity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by Equity Derivatives.\nSecurities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees, largely offset by lower average market values of assets under custody and lower deposits.\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million, reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.\nNoninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and investments in the business, including higher compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.\nThe provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31, (in millions, except headcount)\n2022 2021 2020\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nTotal assets $ 1,334,296 $ 1,259,896 $ 1,095,926\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)\n187,642 159,786 133,296\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(b)\n42,304 50,386 39,588\nTotal loans 229,946 210,172 172,884\nEquity 103,000 83,000 80,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nTotal assets $ 1,406,250 $ 1,334,518 $ 1,121,942\nTrading assets-debt and equity instruments 405,916 448,099 425,060\nTrading assets-derivative receivables 77,802 68,203 69,243\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)\n172,627 145,137 135,676\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(b)\n46,846 51,072 33,792\nTotal loans 219,473 196,209 169,468\nEquity 103,000 83,000 80,000\nHeadcount 73,452 67,546 61,733\n(a)Loans retained includes credit portfolio loans, loans held by consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, trade finance loans, other held-for-investment loans and overdrafts.\n(b)Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value primarily reflect lending related positions originated and purchased in CIB Markets, including loans held for securitization.\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31, (in millions, except ratios)\n2022 2021 2020\nCredit data and quality statistics\nNet charge-offs/(recoveries)\n$ 82 $ 6 $ 370\nNonperforming assets:\nNonaccrual loans:\nNonaccrual loans retained(a)\n718 584 1,008\nNonaccrual loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value(b)\n848 844 1,662\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n1,566 1,428 2,670\nDerivative receivables 296 316 56\nAssets acquired in loan satisfactions\n87 91 85\nTotal nonperforming assets\n1,949 1,835 2,811\nAllowance for credit losses:\nAllowance for loan losses 2,292 1,348 2,366\nAllowance for lending-related commitments 1,448 1,372 1,534\nTotal allowance for credit losses\n3,740 2,720 3,900\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate(c)\n0.05 % - % 0.27 %\nAllowance for loan losses to period-end loans\nretained\n1.22 0.84 1.77\nAllowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits(d)\n1.67 1.12 2.54\nAllowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans\nretained(a)\n319 231 235\nNonaccrual loans to total period-end loans 0.68 0.68 1.54\n(a)Allowance for loan losses of $104 million, $58 million and $278 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $115 million, $281 million and $316 million, respectively.

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as inventory-related revenue, which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the\ndifference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized upon executing new transactions.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted) Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets Fixed Income Markets Equity Markets Total Markets\nPrincipal transactions\n$ 11,682 $ 8,846 $ 20,528 $ 7,911 $ 7,519 $ 15,430 $ 11,857 $ 6,087 $ 17,944\nLending- and deposit-related fees\n303 22 325 321 17 338 226 10 236\nAsset management, administration and commissions\n550 2,007 2,557 545 1,967 2,512 411 2,087 2,498\nAll other income 916 (131) 785 972 (101) 871 493 (62) 431\nNoninterest revenue 13,451 10,744 24,195 9,749 9,402 19,151 12,987 8,122 21,109\nNet interest income 5,166 (377) 4,789 7,116 1,127 8,243 7,891 483 8,374\nTotal net revenue $ 18,617 $ 10,367 $ 28,984 $ 16,865 $ 10,529 $ 27,394 $ 20,878 $ 8,605 $ 29,483\nLoss days(a)\n7 4 4\n(a)Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a funds three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share\nclass level. The Nomura star rating is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a primary share class level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years):All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\nPrimary share class means the C share class for European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong SAR and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not available, the oldest share class is used as the primary share class.\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except ranking data, ratios and headcount)\n2022 2021 2020\n% of JPM mutual fund assets rated as 4- or 5-star(a)\n73 % 69 % 63 %\n% of JPM mutual fund assets ranked in 1st or 2nd\nquartile:(b)\n1 year 65 53 63\n3 years 75 72 69\n5 years 81 80 72\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)(c)\nTotal assets $ 232,037 $ 234,425 $ 203,384\nLoans 214,006 218,271 186,608\nDeposits 233,130 282,052 198,755\nEquity 17,000 14,000 10,500\nSelected balance sheet data (average)(c)\nTotal assets $ 232,438 $ 217,187 $ 181,432\nLoans 215,582 198,487 166,311\nDeposits 261,489 230,296 161,955\nEquity 17,000 14,000 10,500\nHeadcount 26,041 22,762 20,683\nNumber of Global Private Bank client advisors 3,137 2,738 2,462\nCredit data and quality statistics(c)\nNet charge-offs/(recoveries) $ (7) $ 26 $ (14)\nNonaccrual loans 459 708 964\nAllowance for credit losses:\nAllowance for loan losses $ 494 $ 365 $ 598\nAllowance for lending-related commitments\n20 18 38\nTotal allowance for credit losses\n$ 514 $ 383 $ 636\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate - % 0.01 % (0.01) %\nAllowance for loan losses to period-end loans\n0.23 0.17 0.32\nAllowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans\n108 52 62\nNonaccrual loans to period-end loans\n0.21 0.32 0.52\n(a)Represents the Morningstar Rating for all domiciled funds except for Japan domiciled funds which use Nomura.

The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firms four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities.\nTreasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firms asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firms investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firms asset-liability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firms cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments.

When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firms overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\nA Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the Board). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firms performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance framework\nThe Firms risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firms risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firms processes or systems. Operational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firms reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\nThe Firms risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management (IRM) function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firms Chief Executive Officer (CEO) appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board Risk Committee), the Firms Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\nThe Firms CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives (FREs), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate (LOB CROs), and the Firms Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firms risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firms risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards.\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firms three lines of defense are as follows:\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense own the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nResponsibilities also include adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM, which may include policies, standards, limits, thresholds and controls.\nThe second line of defense is the IRM function, which is separate from, and independently assesses and challenges, the first line of defense risk management practices. IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes.\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM.\nRisk identification and ownership\nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporates responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firms business and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporates identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee (FRC) and the Board Risk Committee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firms overall appetite for risk is governed by Risk Appetite frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the Firms risk appetite is set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firms capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is supported by a risk governance and oversight structure that provides channels for the escalation of risks and issues to senior management, the FRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the committees of the Board of Directors and key senior management-level committees in the Firms risk governance and oversight structure. In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.\nThe Firms Operating Committee, which consists of the Firms CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firms Board of Directors. The Operating Committee is responsible for escalating to the Board the information necessary to facilitate the Boards exercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firms Board of Directors actively oversees the business and affairs of the Firm. This includes monitoring the Firms financial performance and condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities through its principal standing committees, each of which consists solely of independent members of the Board. The Board Risk Committee is the principal committee that oversees risk matters. The Audit Committee oversees the control environment, and the Compensation & Management Development Committee oversees compensation and other management-related matters. Each committee of the Board oversees reputational risks, conduct risks, and ESG matters within its scope of responsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firms Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board\nRisk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other management-related matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of managements responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firms risks. The Board Risk Committees responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of managements responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firms assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firms financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firms ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the Firms independent registered public accounting firm, and of the performance of the Firms Internal Audit function.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee (CMDC) assists the Board in its oversight of the Firms compensation principles and practices. The CMDC reviews and approves the Firms compensation and qualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the performance of Operating Committee members against their goals, and approves their compensation awards. In addition, the CEOs award is subject to ratification by the independent directors of the Board. The CMDC also reviews the development of and succession for key executives. As part of the Boards role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the tone at the top, the CMDC oversees the Firms culture, including reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions with respect to employees, including compensation actions.\nThe Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.\nThe Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the Boards performance and self-evaluation.\nManagement oversight\nThe Firms senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee (FRC) is the Firms highest management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the Firms business and provides a forum for discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or escalated by its members and other committees.\nThe Firmwide Control Committee (FCC) is an escalation committee for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment including identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated.\nLine of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and controls that have been established within the scope of their respective activities. These committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees.\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees oversee the operational risk and control environment of their respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of operational risk in a business or function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis on processes with control concerns and overseeing control remediation.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for overseeing the Firms asset and liability management (ALM), including the activities and frameworks supporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and capital risk.\nThe Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (VGF) is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.\nRisk governance and oversight functions\nThe Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or business activity may include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.\nThe following sections discuss the risk governance and oversight functions that have been established to manage the risks inherent in the Firms business activities.\nRisk governance and oversight functions Page\nStrategic Risk 85\nCapital Risk 86-96\nLiquidity Risk 97-104\nReputation Risk 105\nConsumer Credit Risk 110-115\nWholesale Credit Risk 116-126\nInvestment Portfolio Risk 130\nMarket Risk 131-138\nCountry Risk 139-140\nClimate Risk 141\nOperational Risk 142-148\nCompliance Risk 145\nConduct Risk 146\nLegal Risk 147\nEstimations and Model Risk 148\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSTRATEGIC RISK MANAGEMENT\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.\nManagement and oversight\nThe Operating Committee, together with the senior leadership of each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for managing the Firms most significant strategic risks. IRM engages regularly in strategic business discussions and decision-making, including participation in relevant business reviews and senior management meetings, risk and control committees and other relevant governance forums, and acquisition and new business initiative reviews. The Board of Directors oversees managements strategic decisions, and the Board Risk Committee oversees IRM and the Firms risk governance framework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and strategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior management identify the associated risks that are incorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification framework and their impact on risk appetite.\nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of the LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess their impact on the risk profile of the Firm.\nThe Firms strategic planning process, which includes the development of the Firms strategic plan and other strategic initiatives, is one component of managing the Firms strategic risk. The strategic plan outlines the Firms strategic framework and initiatives, and includes components such as budget, risk appetite, capital, earnings and asset-liability management objectives. Guided by the Firms How We Do Business Principles, the Operating Committee and senior management teams in each LOB and Corporate review and update the strategic plan periodically, including evaluating the strategic framework and performance against prior-year initiatives, assessing the operating environment, refining existing strategies and developing new strategies.\nThe Firms strategic plan, together with IRMs assessment, are provided to the Board as part of its review and approval of the Firms strategic plan, and the plan is also reflected in the Firm's budget.\nThe Firms balance sheet strategy, which focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity, is also a component in the management of strategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for further information on capital risk. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on liquidity risk. Refer to Reputation Risk Management on page 105 for further information on reputation risk.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCapital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support the Firms business activities and associated risks during normal economic environments and under stressed conditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firms business strategy and competitive position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firms Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firms fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firms capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firms capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firms earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firms capital strength.\nCapital risk management\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Risk Managements responsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches;\nPerforming an assessment of the Firms capital management activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\nConducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules.\nCapital management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.\nThe primary objectives of the Firms capital management are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firms businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;\nPromote the Firms ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain well-capitalized status for the Firm and its insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiaries at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firms preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nEstablishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firms regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;\nRetaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and\nRegular monitoring of the Firms capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firms capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (CTC) Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firms capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies (BHCs), including the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHCs unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHCs capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes (ICAAP), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firms Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement for the coming year.\nOn June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), and the Firms Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%). The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRefer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on actions taken by the Firms Board of Directors.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firms processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firms ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firms Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework.\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firms earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary.\nContingency Capital Plan\nThe Firms Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firms approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firms IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (Basel III Standardized), and an advanced approach (Basel III Advanced). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firms Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional information.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nCECL regulatory capital transition.\nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firms capital reflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firms CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nStandardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk. On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firms Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized RWA.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nThe following chart presents the Firms Basel III CET1 capital ratio requirements under the Basel III rules currently in effect.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to have a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are required to hold additional levels of capital to serve as a capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements.\nUnder the Federal Reserves GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. Method 1 reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committees assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. Method 2, calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score multiplication factor.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nThe following table presents the Firms effective GSIB surcharge for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. For 2023, the Firms effective GSIB surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to 2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\n2023 2022 2021\nMethod 1 2.5 % 2.0 % 2.0 %\nMethod 2 4.0 % 3.5 % 3.5 %\nOn November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which affirmed the Firms Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023.\nThe Firms Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2024. The Firms estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firms effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.\nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.\nRisk-based Capital Targets\nThe Firms current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firms quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nThe Federal Reserves TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (eligible LTD). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional information.\nLeverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements\nSupplementary leverage ratio\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer.\nThe SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firms total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firms total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.\nOther regulatory capital\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be well-capitalized under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA), respectively.

Liquidity Risk Managements responsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;\nIndependently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;\nPerforming an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on LRMs Independent Review Framework;\nMonitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and\nApproving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions.\nLiquidity management\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.\nThe primary objectives of the Firms liquidity management are to:\nEnsure that the Firms core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and\nManage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\nAnalyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;\nDeveloping internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;\nDefining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-specific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;\nManaging liquidity within the Firms approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;\nManaging compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and\nSetting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.\nAs part of the Firms overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to:\nOptimize liquidity sources and uses;\nMonitor exposures;\nIdentify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firms legal entities; and\nMaintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firms liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.\nInternal stress testing\nLiquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firms resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Parent Company) and the Firms material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firms contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:\nVarying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets;\nEstimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;\nConsiderations of credit rating downgrades;\nCollateral haircuts; and\nPotential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.\nResults of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firms funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the IHC), provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nminimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.\nContingency funding plan\nThe Firms Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) sets out the strategies for addressing and managing liquidity resource needs during a liquidity stress event and incorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and risk appetite tolerances. The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.\nLCR and HQLA\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firms reported eligible HQLA.\nEstimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firms assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 based on the Firms interpretation of the LCR framework.\nThree months ended\nAverage amount\n(in millions) December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 December 31,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)\n$ 542,847 $ 589,158 $ 703,384\nEligible securities(b)(c)\n190,201 126,913 34,738\nTotal HQLA(d)\n$ 733,048 $ 716,071 $ 738,122\nNet cash outflows $ 652,580 $ 635,072 $ 664,801\nLCR 112 % 113 % 111 %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)\n$ 80,468 $ 80,999 $ 73,321\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR 151 % 165 % 178 %\nNet excess eligible HQLA $ 356,733 $ 450,260 $ 555,300\n(a)Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks.\n(b)Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.\n(c)Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment securities on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d)Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.\nThe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firms U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firms website, for a further discussion of the Firms LCR.\nOther liquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firms eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firms eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of available stable funding that is sufficient to meet their required amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firms current interpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be required to publicly disclose its quarterly average NSFR semiannually beginning in the second half of 2023.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firms unsecured and secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on- and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both short- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including stable deposits, secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets and stockholders equity. Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured\nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firms non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firms investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, Average\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021\nConsumer & Community Banking\n$ 1,131,611 $ 1,148,110 $ 1,162,680 $ 1,054,956\nCorporate & Investment Bank\n689,893 707,791 739,700 760,048\nCommercial Banking\n271,342 323,954 294,180 301,343\nAsset & Wealth Management\n233,130 282,052 261,489 230,296\nCorporate\n14,203 396 9,866 511\nTotal Firm $ 2,340,179 $ 2,462,303 $ 2,467,915 $ 2,347,154\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firms reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firms deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.\nAverage deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting:\ngrowth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, partially offset by a decline in deposits starting in the second half of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and\nnet inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by migration into investments starting in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising interest rate environment\npartially offset by\nlower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also as a result of the rising interest rate environment.\nPeriod-end deposits decreased reflecting:\nattrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,\nnet outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate environment, and\na decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.\nThe increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.\nRefer to the discussion of the Firms Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nTotal uninsured deposits include time deposits. The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining maturities. The Firms estimates of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.\n(in millions) December 31,\n2022 December 31,\nU.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S.\nThree months or less $ 43,513 $ 68,765 $ 29,359 $ 49,342\nOver three months but within 6 months 8,670 3,658 6,235 2,172\nOver six months but within 12 months 7,035 2,850 913 459\nOver 12 months 787 2,634 526 2,562\nTotal $ 60,005 $ 77,907 $ 37,033 $ 54,535\nThe table below shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total liabilities, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of December 31,\n(in billions except ratios)\n2022 2021\nDeposits\n$ 2,340.2 $ 2,462.3\nDeposits as a % of total liabilities\n69 % 71 %\nLoans\n$ 1,135.6 $ 1,077.7\nLoans-to-deposits ratio\n49 % 44 %\nThe following table provides a summary of the average balances and average interest rates of JPMorgan Chases deposits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended December 31, Average balances Average interest rates\n(in millions, except interest rates) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nU.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing $ 691,206 $ 648,170 (c)\n$ 495,722 NA NA NA\nInterest-bearing\nDemand(a)\n324,512 322,122 (c)\n269,888 0.92 % 0.06 % 0.25 %\nSavings(b)\n971,788 930,866 (c)\n739,916 0.28 0.06 0.13\nTime 62,022 48,628 59,053 2.07 0.26 1.10\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 1,358,322 1,301,616 1,068,857 0.52 0.07 0.21\nTotal deposits in U.S. offices 2,049,528 1,949,786 1,564,579 0.34 0.05 0.15\nNon-U.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing 28,043 26,315 21,805 NA NA NA\nInterest-bearing\nDemand 324,740 313,304 267,545 0.57\n(0.10) -\nTime 65,604 57,749 52,822 1.85\n(0.09) 0.13\nTotal interest-bearing deposits 390,344 371,053 320,367 0.78 (0.10) 0.02\nTotal deposits in non-U.S. offices 418,387 397,368 342,172 0.73 (0.09) 0.02\nTotal deposits $ 2,467,915 $ 2,347,154 $ 1,906,751 0.41 % 0.02 % 0.12 %\n(a)Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts, and certain trust accounts.\n(b)Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (MMDAs).\n(c)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nRefer to Note 17 for additional information on deposits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nThe following table summarizes short-term and long-term funding, excluding deposits, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and average balances for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firms demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firms liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and market-making portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firms sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds.\nThe decrease in period-end commercial paper and the increase in average balances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior year periods, was due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLong-term funding and issuance\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firms long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal long-term funding plan.\nThe significant majority of the Firms long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.\nLong-term unsecured funding\nYear ended December 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021\n(Notional in millions) Parent Company Subsidiaries\nIssuance\nSenior notes issued in the U.S. market $ 32,600 $ 39,500 $ - $ -\nSenior notes issued in non-U.S. markets 2,752 5,581 - -\nTotal senior notes 35,352 45,081 - -\nSubordinated debt 3,500 - - -\nStructured notes(a)\n2,535 4,113 35,577 32,714\nTotal long-term unsecured funding - issuance\n$ 41,387 $ 49,194 $ 35,577 $ 32,714\nMaturities/redemptions\nSenior notes $ 16,700 $ 10,840 $ 65 $ 65\nSubordinated debt - 9 - -\nStructured notes 1,594 4,694 25,481 33,023\nTotal long-term unsecured funding - maturities/redemptions\n$ 18,294 $ 15,543 $ 25,546 $ 33,088\n(a)Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.\nThe Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB advances. The following table summarizes the securitization issuance and FHLB advances and their respective maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nLong-term secured funding\nYear ended December 31, Issuance Maturities/Redemptions\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021\nCredit card securitization\n$ 999 $ - $ 1,400 $ 2,550\nFHLB advances - - 14 3,011\nOther long-term secured funding(a)\n476 525 268 741\nTotal long-term secured funding\n$ 1,475 $ 525 $ 1,682 $ 6,302\n(a)Includes long-term structured notes that are secured.\nThe Firms wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above. Refer to Note 14 for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCredit ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firms access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.\nAdditionally, the Firms funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firms principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc\nJ.P. Morgan SE (a)\nDecember 31, 2022 Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook Long-term issuer Short-term issuer Outlook\nMoodys Investors Service A1 P-1 Stable Aa2 P-1 Stable Aa3 P-1 Stable\nStandard & Poors A- A-2 Positive A+ A-1 Positive A+ A-1 Positive\nFitch Ratings AA- + Stable AA + Stable AA + Stable\n(a) In January 2022, the three rating agencies affirmed the credit ratings of J.P. Morgan SE, which are equivalent to the ratings previously assigned to J.P. Morgan SE's predecessors, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg S.A. and J.P. Morgan AG.\nOn September 29, 2022, Moodys upgraded the Parent Companys long-term issuer rating to A1 (previously A2) and changed the long-term outlook to stable (previously positive). All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and those of the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's.\nJPMorgan Chases unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firms credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.\nCritical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firms credit ratings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nREPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT\nReputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction may negatively impact perception of the Firms integrity and reduce confidence in the Firms competence by various constituents, including clients, counterparties, customers, investors, regulators, employees, communities or the broader public.\nOrganization and management\nReputation Risk Management establishes the governance framework for managing reputation risk across the Firms LOBs and Corporate. Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.\nThe Firms reputation risk management function includes the following activities:\nMaintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk framework\nOverseeing the governance execution through processes and infrastructure that support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide\nThe types of events that result in reputation risk are wide-ranging and may be introduced by the Firms employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other activity. Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations in assessing the Firms reputation risk, and are a component of the Firms reputation risk governance.\nReputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are escalated as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firms credit risk management governance includes the following activities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines\nAssigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure\nManaging criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\nEstimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrowers credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firms lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firms credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterpartys capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing.\nManagement of the Firms wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval processes\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:\nIndependently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firms wholesale credit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and\nEvaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default (LGD) rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer.\nIn the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value.

Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.\nResidential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.\nRetained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower gross charge-offs.\nLoans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.\nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $15.7 billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $36.3 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firms\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed\nby U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.\n(in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCurrent $ 659 $ 689\n30-89 days past due 136 135\n90 or more days past due 302 623\nTotal government guaranteed loans $ 1,097 $ 1,447\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-to-value ratio of residential real estate loans\nAt December 31, 2022, $152.7 billion, or 64% of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, compared with $145.5 billion, or 65% at December 31, 2021.\nAverage current estimated loan-to-value (LTV) ratios were relatively flat.\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firms residential real estate loans.\nModified residential real estate loans\nThe following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs. Refer to Note 12 for further information on modifications for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nRetained loans $ 11,579 $ 13,251\nNonaccrual retained loans(a)\n3,300 3,938\n(a)At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans included $2.7 billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for additional information about loans modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nAuto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio, including loans at fair value consists of prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and PPP loan forgiveness in Business Banking predominantly offset by originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year due to higher scored Auto and overdraft charge-offs, as the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNonperforming assets\nThe following table presents information as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.\nNonperforming assets(a)\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nNonaccrual loans\nResidential real estate(b)\n$ 4,196 $ 5,231\nAuto and other(c)\n129 119\nTotal nonaccrual loans 4,325 5,350\nAssets acquired in loan satisfactions\nReal estate owned 129 112\nOther 28 22\nTotal assets acquired in loan satisfactions 157 134\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 4,482 $ 5,484\n(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $302 million and $623 million, respectively.

The December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net charge-offs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending.\nConsistent with the Firms policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firms allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2021.\nModifications of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. These TDRs do not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firms wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further information.\nThe Firms wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\nIn 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low.\nAs of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion driven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled commitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firms exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firms expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (ETD), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (OTC-cleared) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firms OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements - excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily - was approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firms use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the clients exposure is in the Firms favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn managements view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the clients derivative contracts move in the Firms favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firms use of collateral agreements.\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.\nDerivative receivables\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nTotal, net of cash collateral $ 70,880 $ 57,081\nLiquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables (23,014) (10,102)\nTotal, net of liquid securities and other cash collateral $ 47,866 $ 46,979\nOther collateralheld against derivative receivables\n(1,261) (1,544)\nTotal, net of collateral $ 46,605 $ 45,435\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nRatings profile of derivative receivables\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios) Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net\nof collateral Exposure net of collateral % of exposure net\nof collateral\nInvestment-grade $ 35,097 75 % $ 30,278 67 %\nNoninvestment-grade 11,508 25 15,157 33\nTotal $ 46,605 100 % $ 45,435 100 %\nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure, the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure. To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent (DRE), and Average exposure (AVG). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firms derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.\nThe fair value of the Firms derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firms AVG to a counterparty and the counterpartys credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firms risk\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterpartys capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterpartys AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firms current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in billions)\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCredit derivatives\nThe Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-user to manage the Firms own credit risk associated with various exposures.\nCredit portfolio management activities\nIncluded in the Firms end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate the credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposure in the Firms wholesale businesses (collectively, credit portfolio management activities). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.\nThe Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firms market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities.\nCredit derivatives and credit-related notes used in credit portfolio management activities\nNotional amount of protection\npurchased and sold(a)\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nCredit derivatives and credit-related notes used to manage:\nLoans and lending-related commitments $ 6,422 $ 4,138\nDerivative receivables 11,721 14,573 (b)\nCredit derivatives and credit-related notes used in credit portfolio management activities $ 18,143 $ 18,711\n(a)Amounts are presented net, considering the Firms net protection purchased or sold with respect to each underlying reference entity or index.\n(b)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation\nThe credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firms view, of the true changes in value of the Firms overall credit exposure.\nThe effectiveness of credit default swaps (CDS) as a hedge against the Firms exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firms CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firms exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nThe Firms allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firms allowance for credit losses comprises:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firms retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion, reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of:\n$2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and\n$1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.\nDeterioration in the Firms macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firms central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2022\n2Q23 4Q23 2Q24\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)\n1.5 % 0.4 % - %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22 4Q22 2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n4.2 % 4.0 % 3.9 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)\n3.1 % 2.8 % 2.1 %\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b)The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates\nwill be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.\nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-115, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\n2022 2021\nYear ended December 31, Consumer, excluding\ncredit card Credit card Wholesale Total Consumer, excluding\ncredit card Credit card Wholesale Total\n(in millions, except ratios)\nAllowance for loan losses\nBeginning balance at January 1, $ 1,765 $ 10,250 $ 4,371 $ 16,386 $ 3,636 $ 17,800 $ 6,892 $ 28,328\nGross charge-offs 812 3,192 322 4,326 630 3,651 283 4,564\nGross recoveries collected (543) (789) (141) (1,473) (619) (939) (141) (1,699)\nNet charge-offs 269 2,403 181 2,853 11 2,712 142 2,865\nProvision for loan losses 543 3,353 2,293 6,189 (1,858) (4,838) (2,375) (9,071)\nOther 1 - 3 4 (2) - (4) (6)\nEnding balance at December 31, $ 2,040 $ 11,200 $ 6,486 $ 19,726 $ 1,765 $ 10,250 $ 4,371 $ 16,386\nAllowance for lending-related commitments\nBeginning balance at January 1, $ 113 $ - $ 2,148 $ 2,261 $ 187 $ - $ 2,222 $ 2,409\nProvision for lending-related commitments\n(37) - 157 120 (75) - (74) (149)\nOther - - 1 1 1 - - 1\nEnding balance at December 31, $ 76 $ - $ 2,306 $ 2,382 $ 113 $ - $ 2,148 $ 2,261\nImpairment methodology\nAsset-specific(a)\n$ (624) $ 223 $ 467 $ 66 $ (665) $ 313 $ 263 $ (89)\nPortfolio-based 2,664 10,977 6,019 19,660 2,430 9,937 4,108 16,475\nTotal allowance for loan losses $ 2,040 $ 11,200 $ 6,486 $ 19,726 $ 1,765 $ 10,250 $ 4,371 $ 16,386\nImpairment methodology\nAsset-specific $ - $ - $ 90 $ 90 $ - $ - $ 167 $ 167\nPortfolio-based 76 - 2,216 2,292 113 - 1,981 2,094\nTotal allowance for lending-related commitments $ 76 $ - $ 2,306 $ 2,382 $ 113 $ - $ 2,148 $ 2,261\nTotal allowance for investment securities NA NA NA $ 96 NA NA NA $ 42\nTotal allowance for credit losses(b)\n$ 2,116 $ 11,200 $ 8,792 $ 22,204 $ 1,878 $ 10,250 $ 6,519 $ 18,689\nMemo:\nRetained loans, end of period\n$ 300,753 $ 185,175 $ 603,670 $ 1,089,598 $ 295,556 $ 154,296 $ 560,354 $ 1,010,206\nRetained loans, average\n299,409 163,335 582,021 1,044,765 298,814 139,900 526,557 965,271\nCredit ratios\nAllowance for loan losses to retained loans\n0.68 % 6.05 % 1.07 % 1.81 % 0.60 % 6.64 % 0.78 % 1.62 %\nAllowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans(c)\n53 NM 330 338 36 NM 213 236\nAllowance for loan losses to retained nonaccrual loans excluding credit card\n53 NM 330 146 36 NM 213 89\nNet charge-off rates 0.09 1.47 0.03 0.27 - 1.94 0.03 0.30\n(a)Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, modified PCD loans, and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR.

The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.\nGovernance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firms Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firms independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firms business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firms principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firms investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firms commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.\nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in billions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nTax-oriented investments, primarily in alternative energy and affordable housing $ 26.2 $ 23.2\nPrivate equity, various debt and equity instruments, and real assets 10.8 (a)\n7.3\nTotal carrying value $ 37.0 $ 30.5\n(a)Includes the Firms 40% ownership in C6 Bank and 49% ownership in Viva Wallet.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firms approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firms risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.\nThe Firms independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks throughout the Firm and defines market risk policies and procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk, facilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce volatility in operating performance and provide transparency into the Firms market risk profile for senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:\nMaintaining a market risk policy framework\nIndependently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\nDefining, approving and monitoring of limits\nPerforming stress testing and qualitative risk assessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:\nValue-at-risk (VaR)\nStress testing\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nEarnings-at-risk\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur.

The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The frameworks approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.\nThe Firms Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firms risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firms valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.\nThe Firms VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firms portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firms modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules (Regulatory VaR), which is used to derive the Firms regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to covered positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firms Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firms Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firms Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nRefer to JPMorgan Chases Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firms website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nThe table below shows the results of the Firms Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.\n(b)In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.\n(c)In March 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR.\n(d)The decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR was driven by lower market values for a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.\n(e)The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components, and consequently, diversification benefit is not meaningful.\nAverage Total VaR increased by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared with the prior year. The increase was driven by the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market observed in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by a decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nFirst Quarter\n2022 Second Quarter\n2022 Third Quarter\n2022 Fourth Quarter\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firms reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firms Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firms Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firms covered positions.\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nOther risk measures\nStress testing\nAlong with VaR, stress testing is an important tool used to assess risk. While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firms vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits.\nThe Firms stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firms Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\nThe Firms stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firms CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firms Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firms reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firms significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the\nFirms traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firms structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firms structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firms interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (non-U.S. dollar currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\ndeposits, deposits with banks, investment securities, long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net interest income baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\nThe impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firms earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits.\nThe pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.\nThe Firms earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firms balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firms simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a positive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative impact, on the Firms earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the\nFirms interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firms net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).\nThe Firms U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions) 2022 2021\nParallel shift:\n+100 bps shift in rates $ (2.0) $ 5.0\n-100 bps shift in rates 2.4 NM (a)\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates 0.8 1.8\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates 3.2 NM (a)\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates (2.8) 3.2\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates (0.9) NM (a)\n(a)Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021.\nThe change in the Firms U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firms baseline for higher interest rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the impact of changes in the Firms balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firms sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.\nThe Firms non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions) 2022 2021\nParallel shift:\n+100 bps shift in rates $ 0.7 $ 0.8\n-100 bps shift in rates $ (0.6) NM (a)\nSteeper yield curve:\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates $ (0.6) NM (a)\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates 0.6 0.8\n(a)Given the level of market interest rates, these scenarios were not considered to be meaningful as of December 31, 2021.\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firms earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nNon-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\nNon-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firms assets or liabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital investments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of the Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 62 for additional information.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (OCI) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market variables.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firms exposures are diversified given the Firms strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\nThe Firms country risk management function includes the following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firms internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firms risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an\nindividual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the Firms internal country risk measurement framework:\nDeposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions\nLending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivatives fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures\nThe Firms internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nStress testing\nStress testing is an important component of the Firms country risk management framework, which aims to estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements to a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary.\nRisk reporting\nCountry exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.\nFor country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (SAR) and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated.\nThe following table presents the Firms top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firms largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firms internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firms view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.\nThe increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.\nThe decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia and government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement Depository. In accordance with requirements of the Bank of Russia, these deposits were transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on February 3, 2023.\nTop 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.)(a)\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021(f)\nDeposits with banks(b)\nLending(c)\nTrading and investing(d)\nOther(e)\nTotal exposure Total exposure\nGermany $ 79.5 $ 11.3 $ 1.9 $ 0.5 $ 93.2 $ 61.7\nUnited Kingdom 30.8 23.0 14.5 1.8 70.1 96.4\nJapan 48.2 3.1 4.2 0.3 55.8 45.5\nAustralia 15.9 6.2 3.6 - 25.7 39.1\nFrance 0.4 11.4 2.6 3.7 18.1 14.0\nBrazil 4.2 4.9 8.7 - 17.8 12.0\nSwitzerland 8.8 3.3 1.6 1.6 15.3 20.9\nCanada 2.6 10.2 1.5 0.1 14.4 16.9\nChina 2.5 5.7 5.5 - 13.7 18.6\nSouth Korea 1.4 3.5 4.9 0.2 10.0 8.7\nSingapore 1.2 4.6 3.7 0.4 9.9 12.3\nBelgium 6.3 1.7 1.2 - 9.2 6.8\nIndia 1.3 4.0 2.8 0.9 9.0 14.7\nSaudi Arabia 0.7 5.6 1.6 - 7.9 9.1\nNetherlands\n0.2 7.2 (0.8) 0.5 7.1 6.8\nSpain\n0.4 4.9 0.5 - 5.8 10.1\nMexico 0.5 4.4 0.5 - 5.4 4.9\nLuxembourg 0.9 2.9 1.5 - 5.3 11.5\nHong Kong SAR 2.8 0.9 0.7 0.1 4.5 5.9\nSweden 1.1 3.1 0.2 - 4.4 4.4\n(a)Country exposures presented in the table reflect 87% and 88% of total Firmwide non-U.S. exposure, where exposure is attributed to an individual country, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(b)Predominantly represents cash placed with central banks.\n(c)Includes loans and accrued interest receivable, lending-related commitments (net of eligible collateral and the allowance for credit losses).

Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures.\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.\nOrganization and management\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risk. The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as appropriate.\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:\nSetting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm\nDeveloping metrics, scenarios, and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm\nEstablishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activities and for adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firms approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firms risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk management into existing governance frameworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.\nThe LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with information on significant climate risks and climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nOPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firms processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firms activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firms financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firms Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk (CCOR) Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firms operational risk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\nThe Firms Global Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\nOperational Risk Identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-assessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firms Operational Risk and Compliance organization (Operational Risk and Compliance) provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management.\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (LDA) statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firms operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), incorporates internal and external losses as well as managements view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firms operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firms CCAR and other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as cybersecurity, business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing are provided below.\nWar in Ukraine and Sanctions\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firms exposure to harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology assets. The Firms security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data,\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firms business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firms own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.\nTo help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firms infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically provided with updates on the Firms Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the Firms efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nplan (IRP) designed to enable the Firm to respond to attempted cybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses with law enforcement and other government agencies, and notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, working with each of the Firms LOBs and Corporate, is responsible for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the controls to manage threats. The organization consists of business aligned information security personnel that are supported within the organization by the following products and services that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:\nCyber Operations\nIdentity & Access Management\nGovernance, Risk & Controls\nGlobal Technology Product Security\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate.\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.\nThe Firms Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firms resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for certain employee roles such as application developers. Finally, the Firms Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firms control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm\u2018s Third-Party Oversight (TPO) and Inter-affiliates Oversight (IAO) frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The Firms Operational Risk and Compliance Organization (Operational Risk and Compliance), which is independent of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firms products and services to clients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firms fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firms Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR Management Framework. The Firms Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the Code) that sets forth the Firms expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does business. The Code requires employees to promptly report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firms business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firms employees, clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code annually.\nEmployees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Firms Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk that any action or misconduct by an employee could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which the Firm operates, harm employees or the Firm, or compromise the Firms reputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying and managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate engagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture consistent with the Firms How We Do Business Principles (the Principles). The Principles serve as a guide for how employees are expected to conduct themselves. With the Principles serving as a guide, the Firms Code sets out the Firms expectations for each employee and provides information and resources to help employees conduct business ethically and in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations everywhere the Firm operates. Refer to Compliance Risk Management on page 145 for further discussion of the Code.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR Management policy, which establishes the framework for governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting conduct risk in the Firm.\nThe Firm has a senior forum that provides oversight of the Firms conduct initiatives to develop a more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect key programs across the Firm in order to identify opportunities and emerging areas of focus. This forum is responsible for setting overall program direction for strategic enhancements to the Firm's employee conduct framework and reviewing the consolidated Firmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.\nConduct risk management encompasses various aspects of people management practices throughout the employee life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, performance management, promotion and compensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and each designated corporate function completes an assessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews metrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and provides conduct education as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nLegal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged failure to meet legal obligations that arise from the rule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm operates, agreements with clients and customers, and products and services offered by the Firm.\nOverview\nThe global Legal function (Legal) provides legal services and advice to the Firm. Legal is responsible for managing the Firms exposure to legal risk by:\nmanaging actual and potential litigation and enforcement matters, including internal reviews and investigations related to such matters\nadvising on products and services, including contract negotiation and documentation\nadvising on offering and marketing documents and new business initiatives\nmanaging dispute resolution\ninterpreting existing laws, rules and regulations, and advising on changes to them\nadvising on advocacy in connection with contemplated and proposed laws, rules and regulations, and\nproviding legal advice to the LOBs, Corporate and the Board.\nLegal selects, engages and manages outside counsel for the Firm on all matters in which outside counsel is engaged. In addition, Legal advises the Firms Conflicts Office which reviews the Firms wholesale transactions that may have the potential to create conflicts of interest for the Firm.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firms General Counsel reports to the CEO and is a member of the Operating Committee, the Firmwide Risk Committee and the Firmwide Control Committee. The Firms General Counsel and other members of Legal report on significant legal matters to the Firms Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee.\nLegal serves on and advises various committees and advises the Firms LOBs and Corporate on potential reputation risk issues.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\nEstimations and Model risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused estimation outputs.\nThe Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations across various businesses and functions. The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review (MRGR), defines and governs the Firms policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGRs scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firms reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firms Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firms policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chases accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firms most complex accounting estimates require managements judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firms critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firms allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firms financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firms retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firms policies and methodologies used to determine the Firms allowance for credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firms allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firms methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (MEVs) that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firms assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.\nFor example, compared to the Firms central scenario shown on page 127 and in Note 13, the Firms relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:\nThe allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\nThe impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.\nExpectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses.\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firms allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:\nAn increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments\nAn increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans\nAn increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments\nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022.\nFair value\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nAssets measured at fair value\nThe following table includes the Firms assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further information.\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions, except ratios) Total assets at fair value Total level 3 assets\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ 311,883 $ -\nSecurities borrowed 70,041 -\nTrading assets:\nTrading-debt and equity instruments 382,876 2,909\nDerivative receivables(a)\n70,880 10,682\nTotal trading assets 453,756 13,591\nAFS securities 205,857 239\nLoans 42,079 1,418\nMSRs 7,973 7,973\nOther 14,014 405\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\n1,105,603 23,626\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\n2,658 1,979\nTotal assets measured at fair value\n$ 1,108,261 $ 25,605\nTotal Firm assets $ 3,665,743\nLevel 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets(a)\n0.7 %\nLevel 3 assets at fair value as a percentage of total Firm assets at fair value(a)\n2.3 %\n(a)For purposes of the table above, the derivative receivables total reflects the impact of netting adjustments; however, the $10.7 billion of derivative receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nValuation\nDetails of the Firms processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firms creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firms valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firms process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.\nThe projections for the Firms reporting units are consistent with managements current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firms best estimates of long-term growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate (RR) and cost per point (CPP) assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nManagements discussion and analysis\nto these assumptions will impact the rewards liability. As of December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $315 million.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chases interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firms estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firms results of operations in any reporting period.\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in managements judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted.\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (FTC) carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chases unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firms income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firms provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe Firms provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firms effective tax rate.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Standards Adopted since January 1, 2021\nStandard Summary of guidance Effects on financial statements\nReference Rate\nReform\nIssued March\n2020 and updated January 2021 and December 2022\nProvides optional expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance when financial instruments, hedge accounting relationships, and other transactions are amended due to reference rate reform.\nProvides an election to account for certain contract amendments related to reference rate reform as modifications rather than extinguishments without the requirement to assess the significance of the amendments.\nAllows for changes in critical terms of a hedge accounting relationship without automatic termination of that relationship. Provides various practical expedients and elections designed to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted during the transition period.\nProvides a one-time election to transfer securities out of the held-to-maturity classification if certain criteria are met.\nThe January 2021 update provides an election to account for derivatives modified to change the rate used for discounting, margining, or contract price alignment (collectively discounting transition) as modifications.\nThe December 2022 update extends the termination date of the optional expedients and exceptions to current accounting guidance to December 31, 2024.\nIssued and effective March 12, 2020. The January 7, 2021 and December 21, 2022 updates were effective when issued.\nThe Firm elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications and hedge accounting relationships, and discounting transition beginning in the third quarter of 2020. The discounting transition election was applied retrospectively. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform. These elections did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFASB Standards Issued but Not Adopted as of December 31, 2022\nStandard\nSummary of guidance\nEffects on financial statements\nDerivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method\nIssued March 2022\nExpands the current ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged.

(JPMorgan Chase or the Firm) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firms principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chases Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nJPMorgan Chases internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firms assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chases management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firms assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the assessment, management used the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (COSO 2013) promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chases internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon managements assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJeremy Barnum\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 21, 2023\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries (the Firm) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Firms internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firms management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firms consolidated financial statements and on the Firms internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 300 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $17.0 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $785.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firms allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firms allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firms forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firms allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing managements process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of managements adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables.\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and $453.7 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $13.6 billion of trading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates, correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firms determination of the fair value, including controls over models, inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of these financial instruments and comparing managements estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent inputs and, as appropriate, evaluating and utilizing managements aforementioned unobservable inputs.\nFebruary 21, 2023\nWe have served as the Firms auditor since 1965.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nConsolidated statements of income\nYear ended December 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2022 2021 2020\nRevenue\nInvestment banking fees $ 6,686 $ 13,216 $ 9,486\nPrincipal transactions 19,912 16,304 18,021\nLending- and deposit-related fees 7,098 7,032 6,511\nAsset management, administration and commissions 20,677 21,029 18,177\nInvestment securities gains/(losses) (2,380) (345) 802\nMortgage fees and related income 1,250 2,170 3,091\nCard income 4,420 5,102 4,435\nOther income 4,322 4,830 4,865\nNoninterest revenue 61,985 69,338 65,388\nInterest income 92,807 57,864 64,523\nInterest expense 26,097 5,553 9,960\nNet interest income 66,710 52,311 54,563\nTotal net revenue 128,695 121,649 119,951\nProvision for credit losses 6,389 (9,256) 17,480\nNoninterest expense\nCompensation expense 41,636 38,567 34,988\nOccupancy expense 4,696 4,516 4,449\nTechnology, communications and equipment expense 9,358 9,941 10,338\nProfessional and outside services 10,174 9,814 8,464\nMarketing 3,911 3,036 2,476\nOther expense 6,365 5,469 5,941\nTotal noninterest expense 76,140 71,343 66,656\nIncome before income tax expense 46,166 59,562 35,815\nIncome tax expense 8,490 11,228 6,684\nNet income $ 37,676 $ 48,334 $ 29,131\nNet income applicable to common stockholders $ 35,892 $ 46,503 $ 27,410\nNet income per common share data\nBasic earnings per share $ 12.10 $ 15.39 $ 8.89\nDiluted earnings per share 12.09 15.36 8.88\nWeighted-average basic shares 2,965.8 3,021.5 3,082.4\nWeighted-average diluted shares 2,970.0 3,026.6 3,087.4\nThe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nConsolidated statements of comprehensive income\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nNet income $ 37,676 $ 48,334 $ 29,131\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), after-tax\nUnrealized gains/(losses) on investment securities (11,764) (5,540) 4,123\nTranslation adjustments, net of hedges (611) (461) 234\nFair value hedges 98 (19) 19\nCash flow hedges (5,360) (2,679) 2,320\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans (1,241) 922 212\nDVA on fair value option elected liabilities 1,621 (293) (491)\nTotal other comprehensive income/(loss), after-tax (17,257) (8,070) 6,417\nComprehensive income $ 20,419 $ 40,264 $ 35,548\nThe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nConsolidated balance sheets\nDecember 31, (in millions, except share data) 2022 2021\nAssets\nCash and due from banks $ 27,697 $ 26,438\nDeposits with banks 539,537 714,396\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements (included $311,883 and $252,720 at fair value)\n315,592 261,698\nSecurities borrowed (included $70,041 and $81,463 at fair value)\n185,369 206,071\nTrading assets (included assets pledged of $93,687 and $102,710)\n453,799 433,575\nAvailable-for-sale securities (amortized cost of $216,188 and $308,254;

(JPMorgan Chase or the Firm), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firms business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\nVoting interest entities\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations. For these types of entities, the Firms determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members\nhave rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest.\nThe Firms investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.\nVariable interest entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPEs investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPEs assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nincludes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIEs assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.\nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIEs capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.\nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firms involvement with a VIE cause the Firms consolidation conclusion to change.\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firms VIEs.\nRevenue recognition\nInterest income\nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\nRevenue from contracts with customers\nJPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers, in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firms related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firms revenue from contracts with customers.\nPrincipal transactions revenue\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.\nUse of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation\nJPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.\nGains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of in the money transactions are netted against the negative values of out of the money transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the demanding party). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firms derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firms securities financing agreements.\nStatements of cash flows\nFor JPMorgan Chases Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2023\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology, and allows the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate.\nThe Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $600 million and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $450 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.\nAccounting standard adopted January 1, 2020\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (CECL)\nThe adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that managements estimate reflects credit losses over the instruments remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firms allowance for credit losses represented managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firms retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan Chases other significant accounting policies and the Note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found.\nFair value measurement Note 2 page 167\nFair value option Note 3 page 188\nDerivative instruments Note 5 page 194\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest expense\nNote 6 page 208\nInterest income and Interest expense Note 7 page 211\nPension and other postretirement employee benefit plans\nNote 8 page 212\nEmployee share-based incentives Note 9 page 215\nInvestment securities Note 10 page 217\nSecurities financing activities Note 11 page 222\nLoans Note 12 page 225\nAllowance for credit losses Note 13 page 242\nVariable interest entities Note 14 page 247\nGoodwill and Mortgage servicing rights Note 15 page 255\nPremises and equipment Note 16 page 259\nLeases Note 18 page 260\nLong-term debt Note 20 page 263\nEarnings per share Note 23 page 268\nIncome taxes Note 25 page 270\nOff-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments\nNote 28 page 276\nLitigation Note 30 page 283\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 2 - Fair value measurement\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firms businesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation process\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firms Valuation Control Group (VCG), which is part of the Firms Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firms positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firms Valuation Governance Forum (VGF), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firms Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the\nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.\nPrice verification process\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risk-taking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-offer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.\nThe Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nUncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.\nWhere appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firms own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.\nValuation model review and approval\nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.\nUnder the Firms Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firms policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\nFair value hierarchy\nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 - one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nA financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant products/instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument Valuation methodology Classifications in the fair value hierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements Valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider: Predominantly level 2\nDerivative features: refer to the discussion of derivatives below for further information\nMarket rates for the respective maturity\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related commitments - wholesale\nLoans carried at fair value\n(trading loans and non-trading loans) and associated\nlending-related commitments\nWhere observable market data is available, valuations are based on: Level 2 or 3\nObserved market prices (circumstances are infrequent)\nRelevant broker quotes\nObserved market prices for similar instruments\nWhere observable market data is unavailable or limited, valuations are based on discounted cash flows, which consider the following:\nCredit spreads derived from the cost of CDS; or benchmark credit curves developed by the Firm, by industry and credit rating\nPrepayment speed\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans - consumer Fair value is based on observable market prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar collateral and incorporates adjustments to these prices to account for differences between the securities and the value of the underlying loans, which include credit characteristics, portfolio composition, and liquidity. Predominantly level 2\nLoans carried at fair value - conforming residential mortgage loans expected to be sold\nInvestment and trading securities Quoted market prices Level 1\nIn the absence of quoted market prices, securities are valued based on: Level 2 or 3\nObservable market prices for similar securities\nRelevant broker quotes\nDiscounted cash flows\nIn addition, the following inputs to discounted cash flows are used for the following products:\nMortgage- and asset-backed securities specific inputs:\nCollateral characteristics\nDeal-specific payment and loss allocations\nCurrent market assumptions related to yield, prepayment speed, conditional default rates and loss severity\nCollateralized loan obligations (CLOs) specific inputs:\nCollateral characteristics\nDeal-specific payment and loss allocations\nExpected prepayment speed, conditional default rates, loss severity\nCredit spreads\nCredit rating data\nPhysical commodities Valued using observable market prices or data.

Level 1\nDerivatives that are valued using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs as well as considering the contractual terms.\nThe key valuation inputs used will depend on the type of derivative and the nature of the underlying instruments and may include equity prices, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, volatilities, correlations, CDS spreads, recovery rates and prepayment speed.\nLevel 2 or 3\nIn addition, specific inputs used for derivatives that are valued based on models with significant unobservable inputs are as follows:\nInterest rate and FX exotic derivatives specific inputs include:\nInterest rate curve\nInterest rate volatility\nInterest rate spread volatility\nBermudan switch value\nInterest rate correlation\nInterest rate-FX correlation\nForeign exchange correlation\nCredit derivatives specific inputs include:\nCredit correlation between the underlying debt instruments\nEquity derivatives specific inputs include:\nForward equity price\nEquity volatility\nEquity correlation\nEquity-FX correlation\nEquity-IR correlation\nCommodity derivatives specific inputs include:\nForward commodity price\nCommodity volatility\nCommodity correlation\nAdditionally, adjustments are made to reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA) and the impact of funding (FVA). Refer to page 184 of this Note.\nMortgage servicing rights Refer to Mortgage servicing rights in Note 15. Level 3\nPrivate equity direct investments Fair value is estimated using all available information; the range of potential inputs include: Level 2 or 3\nTransaction prices\nTrading multiples of comparable public companies\nOperating performance of the underlying portfolio company\nAdjustments as required, since comparable public companies are not identical to the company being valued, and for company-specific issues and lack of liquidity\nAdditional available inputs relevant to the investment\nFund investments (e.g., mutual/collective investment funds, private equity funds, hedge funds, and real estate funds) Net asset value\nNAV is supported by the ability to redeem and purchase at the NAV level Level 1\nAdjustments to the NAV as required, for restrictions on redemption (e.g., lock-up periods or withdrawal limitations) or where observable activity is limited Level 2 or 3(a)\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs Valued using observable market information, where available. Level 2 or 3\nIn the absence of observable market information, valuations are based on the fair value of the underlying assets held by the VIE.\n(a)Excludes certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nProduct/instrument Valuation methodology Classification in the fair value hierarchy\nStructured notes (included in deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt) Valuations are based on discounted cash flow analyses that consider the embedded derivative and the terms and payment structure of the note.\nThe embedded derivative features are considered using models such as the Black-Scholes option pricing model, simulation models, or a combination of models that may use observable or unobservable valuation inputs, depending on the embedded derivative. The specific inputs used vary according to the nature of the embedded derivative features, as described in the discussion above regarding derivatives valuation. Adjustments are then made to this base valuation to reflect the Firms own credit risk (DVA).

Net realizable value is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (transaction costs). Transaction costs for the Firms physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firms physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firms hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $950 million and $801 million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were trading assets of $43 million and $51 million, respectively, and other assets of $907 million and $750 million, respectively.\n(e)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $9.7 billion and $26.2 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.8 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $2.4 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively.\n(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further information on the Firms valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nThe following table presents the Firms primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.\nIn the Firms view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firms estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3 inputs(a)\nDecember 31, 2022\nProduct/Instrument Fair value (in millions)\nPrincipal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g)\nRange of input values Average(i)\nResidential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)\n$ 1,649 Discounted cash flows Yield 4% 15% 7%\nPrepayment speed 3% 11% 8%\nConditional default rate 0% 5% 0%\nLoss severity 0% 110% 3%\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c)\n423 Market comparables Price $0 $99 $83\nCorporate debt securities 702 Market comparables Price $0 $243 $95\nLoans(d)\n876 Market comparables Price $0 $356 $77\nNon-U.S. government debt securities 155 Market comparables Price $6 $100 $84\nNet interest rate derivatives 735 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 28bps 674bps 141bps\nInterest rate spread volatility 23bps 35bps 26bps\nBermudan switch value 0% 57% 17%\nInterest rate correlation (82)% 89% 16%\nIR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 7%\n(34) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% 21% 7%\nNet credit derivatives (9) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 30% 60% 43%\nCredit spread 1bps 12,107bps 1,057bps\nRecovery rate 10% 67% 45%\n22 Market comparables Price $15 $115 $82\nNet foreign exchange derivatives 577 Option pricing IR-FX correlation (40)% 60% 21%\n(88) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 9% 9%\nInterest rate curve 2% 29% 8%\nNet equity derivatives (384) Option pricing Forward equity price(h)\n84% 144% 100%\nEquity volatility 5% 141% 37%\nEquity correlation 17% 99% 55%\nEquity-FX correlation (86)% 60% (27)%\nEquity-IR correlation (5)% 50% 23%\nNet commodity derivatives (146) Option pricing Oil commodity forward $72 / BBL $251 / BBL $162 / BBL\nNatural gas commodity forward $1 / MMBTU $24 / MMBTU $13 / MMBTU\nCommodity volatility 4% 154% 79%\nCommodity correlation (45)% 77% 16%\nMSRs 7,973 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 15\nLong-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e)\n26,583 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 28bps 674bps 141bps\nBermudan switch value 0% 57% 17%\nInterest rate correlation (82)% 89% 16%\nIR-FX correlation (35)% 60% 7%\nEquity correlation 17% 99% 55%\nEquity-FX correlation (86)% 60% (27)%\nEquity-IR correlation (5)% 50% 23%\n1,072 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 30% 60% 43%\nOther level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f)\n1,029\n(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firms positions.\nYield - The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nCredit spread - The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.\nPrepayment speed - The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.\nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\nConditional default rate - The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firms market-making portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.\nLoss severity - The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lenders lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation - Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.\nVolatility - Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nBermudan switch value - The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\nInterest rate curve - represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.\nForward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firms risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nFair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) Fair value at January 1, 2022 Total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) Transfers into\nlevel 3 Transfers (out of) level 3 Fair value at Dec. 31, 2022 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) related to financial instruments held at Dec. 31, 2022\nPurchases(g)\nSales Settlements(h)\nAssets:(a)\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ -

a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firms risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 178-182 for further information on these instruments.\n$7.7 billion of net gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements and gains in MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates.\n$4.6 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by a decline in the fair value of long-term debt due to market movements.\n$495 million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net interest rate derivative receivables due to market movements, partially offset by losses in net equity derivative receivables and net commodity derivative receivables due to market movements.\n$1.1 billion of net gains on liabilities, driven by gains in short-term borrowings due to market movements.\n$10 million of net gains on assets driven by gains in net interest rate derivative receivables due to market movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates.\n$102 million of net gains on liabilities driven by market movements in short-term borrowings.\nRefer to Note 15 for information on MSRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit and funding adjustments - derivatives\nDerivatives are generally valued using models that use as their basis observable market parameters. These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firms own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firms existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firms credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firms FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firms positions with\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firms credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firms own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firms own credit quality over time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA $ 22 $ 362 $ (337)\nDerivatives FVA 42 47 (64)\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities\nThe valuation of the Firms liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firms own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firms probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firms credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI. Refer to page 182 in this Note and Note 24 for further information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nThe following tables present the assets and liabilities held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for which nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) Fair value hierarchy Total fair value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLoans $ - $ 643\n$ 627 (b)\n$ 1,270\nOther assets(a)\n- 36 1,352 1,388\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ 679 $ 1,979\n$ 2,658\nAccounts payable and other liabilities - - 84 84\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ - $ 84 $ 84\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions) Fair value hierarchy Total fair value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLoans $ - $ 1,006\n$ 856 $ 1,862\nOther assets - 4 1,612\n1,616\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\n$ - $ 1,010 $ 2,468 $ 3,478\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n- - 3 3\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\n$ - $ - $ 3 $ 3\n(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $1.4 billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $1.2 billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.\n(b) Of the $627 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022, $83 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from brokers price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firms experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 9% to 56% with a weighted average of 23%.\nNonrecurring fair value changes\nThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nLoans $ (55)\n$ (72) $ (393)\nOther assets(a)\n(409)\n344 (529)\nAccounts payable and other liabilities (83)\n5 (11)\nTotal nonrecurring fair value gains/(losses)\n$ (547) $ 277 $ (933)\n(a)Included $(338) million, $379 million and $(134) million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of net gains/(losses) as a result of the measurement alternative.\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about the measurement of collateral-dependent loans.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values\nThe Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e., measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.\nIn its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firms estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firms valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nOther assets\nCarrying value(a)\n$ 4,096 $ 3,642\nUpward carrying value changes(b)\nDownward carrying value changes/impairment(c)\n(826) (53)\n(a)The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.\n(b)The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $1.4 billion.\n(c)The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2022 were $(918) million.\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firms interest in Visa Class B common shares (Visa B shares) recorded at a nominal carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of $914 million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares (Visa A shares) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firms sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.\nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firms estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firms remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.\nFinancial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value\nCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\naccrued liabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be\nequal to their carrying value; recognition of the inherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at December 31, 2022 and 2021, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nEstimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy\n(in billions) Carrying\nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated\nfair value Carrying\nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated\nfair value\nFinancial assets\nCash and due from banks $ 27.7 $ 27.7 $ - $ - $ 27.7 $ 26.4 $ 26.4 $ - $ - $ 26.4\nDeposits with banks 539.5 539.3 0.2 - 539.5 714.4 714.1 (b)\n0.3 (b)\n- 714.4\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable\n124.7 - 124.6 0.1 124.7 102.1 - 102.0 0.1 102.1\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements\n3.7 - 3.7 - 3.7 9.0 - 9.0 - 9.0\nSecurities borrowed\n115.3 - 115.3 - 115.3 124.6 - 124.6 - 124.6\nInvestment securities, held-to-maturity\n425.3 189.1 199.5 - 388.6 363.7 183.3 179.3 - 362.6\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses(a)\n1,073.9 - 194.0 853.9 1,047.9 1,002.5 - 202.1 821.1 1,023.2\nOther 101.2 - 99.6 1.7 101.3 98.7 - 97.4 1.4 98.8\nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits $ 2,311.6 $ - $ 2,311.5 $ - $ 2,311.5 $ 2,451.0 $ - $ 2,451.0 $ - $ 2,451.0\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements\n50.6 - 50.6 - 50.6 67.9 - 67.9 - 67.9\nShort-term borrowings 28.2 - 28.2 - 28.2 33.6 - 33.6 - 33.6\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n257.5 - 251.2 5.6 256.8 217.6 - 212.1 4.9 217.0\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\n12.6 - 12.6 - 12.6 10.7 - 10.8 - 10.8\nLong-term debt 223.6 - 216.5 2.8 219.3 226.0 - 229.5 3.1 232.6\n(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loans allowance for loan losses, which represents the loans expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\n(b)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe majority of the Firms lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected\nThe following describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were determined.\nLoans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are attributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.\nLong-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firms credit spread as observed in the bond market.\nSecurities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\n2022 2021\nDecember 31, (in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding\nLoans\nNonaccrual loans\nLoans reported as trading assets $ 2,517 $ 368 $ (2,149) $ 3,263 $ 546 $ (2,717)\nLoans 967 829 (138) 918 797 (121)\nSubtotal 3,484 1,197 (2,287) 4,181 1,343 (2,838)\n90 or more days past due and government guaranteed\nLoans(a)\n124 115 (9) 293 281 (12)\nAll other performing loans(b)\nLoans reported as trading assets 7,823 6,135 (1,688) 8,529 (e)\n7,528 (1,001) (e)\nLoans 42,588 41,135 (1,453) 57,490 (e)\n57,742 252 (e)\nSubtotal 50,411 47,270 (3,141) 66,019 65,270 (749)\nTotal loans $ 54,019 $ 48,582 $ (5,437) $ 70,493 $ 66,894 $ (3,599)\nLong-term debt\nPrincipal-protected debt $ 41,341 (d)\n$ 31,105 $ (10,236) $ 35,957 (d)\n$ 33,799 $ (2,158)\nNonprincipal-protected debt(c)\nNA 41,176 NA NA 41,135 NA\nTotal long-term debt NA $ 72,281 NA NA $ 74,934 NA\nLong-term beneficial interests\nNonprincipal-protected debt(c)\nNA $ 5 NA NA $ 12 NA\nTotal long-term beneficial interests NA $ 5 NA NA $ 12 NA\n(a)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.\n(b)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firms next call date.\n(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $7.6 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $24 million and $10 million, respectively.

Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firms risk appetite.\nIn the Firms consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firms consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\nThe Firms wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans.\nThe Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.\nTerms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firms assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe table below presents both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the Firms three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets.\n(g)Excludes cash placed with banks of $556.6 billion and $729.6 billion, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.\n(h)Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables.\n(i)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP, respectively. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.\n(j)Represents lending-related financial instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 5 - Derivative instruments\nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firms derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes.\nMarket-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firms derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.\nRisk management derivatives\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firms net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar-equivalent values of the foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.\nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types\nThe Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firms counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firms clearing services.\nAccounting for derivatives\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nDerivatives designated as hedges\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk management purposes - generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firms risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currency-denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are\nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firms net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table outlines the Firms primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.\nType of Derivative Use of Derivative Designation and disclosure Affected segment or unit Page reference\nManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\nInterest rate\nHedge fixed rate assets and liabilities Fair value hedge Corporate\n202-203\nInterest rate\nHedge floating-rate assets and liabilities Cash flow hedge Corporate\nForeign exchange\nHedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities\nFair value hedge\nCorporate\n202-203\nForeign exchange\nHedge foreign currency-denominated forecasted revenue and expense\nCash flow hedge Corporate\nForeign exchange\nHedge the value of the Firms investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities\nNet investment hedge\nCorporate\nCommodity\nHedge commodity inventory Fair value hedge\nCIB, AWM 202-203\nManage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\nInterest rate\nManage the risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs\nSpecified risk management CCB 205\nCredit\nManage the credit risk associated with wholesale lending exposures\nSpecified risk management\nCIB 205\nInterest rate and foreign exchange\nManage the risk associated with certain other specified assets and liabilities Specified risk management\nCorporate\nMarket-making derivatives and other activities:\nVarious\nMarket-making and related risk management Market-making and other\nCIB 205\nVarious\nOther derivatives Market-making and other\nCIB, AWM, Corporate 205\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotional amount of derivative contracts\nThe following table summarizes the notional amount of free-standing derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNotional amounts(b)\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021\nInterest rate contracts\nSwaps\n$ 24,491 $ 24,075\nFutures and forwards\n2,636 2,520\nWritten options\n3,047 3,018\nPurchased options\n2,992 3,188\nTotal interest rate contracts\n33,166 32,801\nCredit derivatives(a)\n1,132 1,053\nForeign exchange contracts\nCross-currency swaps\n4,196 4,112\nSpot, futures and forwards\n7,017 7,679\nWritten options\n775 741\nPurchased options\n759 727\nTotal foreign exchange contracts\n12,747 13,259\nEquity contracts\nSwaps\n618 612\nFutures and forwards\n110 139\nWritten options\n636 654\nPurchased options\n580 598\nTotal equity contracts 1,944 2,003\nCommodity contracts\nSwaps\n136 185\nSpot, futures and forwards\n136 188\nWritten options\n117 135\nPurchased options\n98 111\nTotal commodity contracts\n487 619\nTotal derivative notional amounts\n$ 49,476 $ 49,735\n(a)Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on pages 205-207 for more information on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts.\n(b)Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts.\nWhile the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firms derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firms view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions.

Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLiquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\nIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk - the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firms and its subsidiaries respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\n(in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nAggregate fair value of net derivative payables $ 16,023 $ 20,114\nCollateral posted 15,505 19,402\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.\nLiquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n(in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade\nAmount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a)\n$ 128 $ 1,293 $ 219 $ 1,577\nAmount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b)\n88 925 98 787\n(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b)Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income\nThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting\ndesignation or purpose.\nFair value hedge gains and losses\nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.\nThe Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nOver the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.5) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firms longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.\nNet investment hedge gains and losses\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)\nAmounts recorded in\nOCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)\nAmounts recorded in\nOCI Amounts recorded in income(a)(b)\nAmounts recorded in\nOCI\nForeign exchange derivatives $(123) $3,591 $(228) $2,452 $(122) $(1,408)\n(a)Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.\n(c)Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives\nThe Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nCredit derivatives\nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firms market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (single-name), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.\nCredit-related notes\nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table below.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firms view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\nTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes\nMaximum payout/Notional amount\nProtection sold Protection purchased with identical underlyings(c)\nNet protection (sold)/purchased(d)\nOther protection purchased(e)\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions)\nCredit derivatives\nCredit default swaps $ (495,557) $ 509,846 $ 14,289 $ 2,917\nOther credit derivatives(a)\n(47,165) 65,029 17,864 11,746\nTotal credit derivatives (542,722) 574,875 32,153 14,663\nCredit-related notes(b)\n- - - 7,863\nTotal $ (542,722) $ 574,875 $ 32,153 $ 22,526\nMaximum payout/Notional amount\nProtection sold Protection purchased with identical underlyings(c)\nNet protection (sold)/purchased(d)\nOther protection purchased(e)\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions)\nCredit derivatives\nCredit default swaps $ (443,481) $ 458,180 $ 14,699 $ 2,269\nOther credit derivatives(a)\n(56,130) 79,586 23,456 13,435\nTotal credit derivatives (499,611) 537,766 38,155 15,704\nCredit-related notes(b)\n- - - 9,437\nTotal $ (499,611) $ 537,766 $ 38,155 $ 25,141\n(a)Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b)Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.\n(c)Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection sold.\n(d)Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement value.\n(e)Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of credit derivatives as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.\nProtection sold - credit derivatives ratings(a)/maturity profile\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) <1 year 1-5 years >5 years Total notional amount Fair value of receivables(b)\nFair value of payables(b)\nNet fair value\nRisk rating of reference entity\nInvestment-grade $ (90,484) $ (294,791) $ (30,822) $ (416,097) $ 2,324 $ (1,495) $ 829\nNoninvestment-grade (33,244) (87,011) (6,370) (126,625) 1,267 (3,209) (1,942)\nTotal $ (123,728) $ (381,802) $ (37,192) $ (542,722) $ 3,591 $ (4,704) $ (1,113)\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions) <1 year 1-5 years >5 years Total notional amount Fair value of receivables(b)\nFair value of payables(b)\nNet fair value\nRisk rating of reference entity\nInvestment-grade $ (91,155) $ (255,106) $ (29,035) $ (375,296) $ 3,645 $ (623) $ 3,022\nNoninvestment-grade (32,175) (84,851) (7,289) (124,315) 2,630 (2,003) 627\nTotal $ (123,330) $ (339,957) $ (36,324) $ (499,611) $ 6,275 $ (2,626) $ 3,649\n(a)The ratings scale is primarily based on external credit ratings defined by S&P and Moodys.\n(b)Amounts are shown on a gross basis, before the benefit of legally enforceable master netting agreements including cash collateral netting.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 6 - Noninterest revenue and noninterest expense\nNoninterest revenue\nThe Firm records noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management, administration, and commissions, and components of card income. The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees\nThis revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the clients transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.\nThe Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the clients transaction.\nThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nUnderwriting\nEquity $ 975 $ 3,969 $ 2,759\nDebt 2,732 4,853 4,362\nTotal underwriting 3,707 8,822 7,121\nAdvisory 2,979 4,394 2,365\nTotal investment banking fees $ 6,686 $ 13,216 $ 9,486\nInvestment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results.\nPrincipal transactions\nPrincipal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:\nthe bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.\n-Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.\n-Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.\nIn connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.\nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:\nderivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;\nderivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.\nIn the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.\nThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firms client-driven market-making activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense.\nTrading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firms client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nTrading revenue by\ninstrument type\nInterest rate(a)\n$ 3,010 $ 1,646 $ 2,575\nCredit(b)\n1,412 (c)\n2,691 2,753\nForeign exchange 5,119 2,787 4,253\nEquity 8,068 7,773 6,171\nCommodity 2,348 1,428 2,088\nTotal trading revenue 19,957 16,325 17,840\nPrivate equity gains/(losses) (45) (21) 181\nPrincipal transactions $ 19,912 $ 16,304 $ 18,021\n(a)Includes the impact of changes in funding valuation adjustments on derivatives.\n(b)Includes the impact of changes in credit valuation adjustments on derivatives, net of the associated hedging activities.\n(c)Includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio.\nPrincipal transactions revenue is earned primarily by CIB.

The Firm manages assets on behalf of its clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts. Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities. Amounts paid to these third-party service\nproviders are generally recorded in professional and outside services expense.\nThe following table presents the components of Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nAsset management fees\nInvestment management fees(a)\n$ 13,765 $ 14,027 $ 11,694\nAll other asset management fees(b)\n331 378 338\nTotal asset management fees 14,096 14,405 12,032\nTotal administration fees(c)\n2,348 2,554 2,249\nCommissions and other fees\nBrokerage commissions(d)\n2,831 3,046 2,959\nAll other commissions and fees(e)\n1,402 1,024 937\nTotal commissions and fees 4,233 4,070 3,896\nTotal asset management, administration and commissions\n$ 20,677 $ 21,029 $ 18,177\n(a)Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firms clients, including investors in Firm-sponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts.\n(b)Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned on the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients.

Refer to Note 32 for segment results.\nMortgage fees and related income\nThis revenue category reflects CCBs Home Lending production and net mortgage servicing revenue.\nProduction revenue includes fees and income recognized as earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell, and the impact of risk management activities associated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse loans. Production revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies), and changes in the fair value of financial instruments measured under the fair value option. Net mortgage servicing revenue includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nwith MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue also includes gains and losses on sales and lower of cost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government agencies.\nRefer to Note 15 for further information on risk management activities and MSRs.\nNet interest income from mortgage loans is recorded in interest income.\nCard income\nThis revenue category includes interchange and other income from credit and debit card transactions; and fees earned from processing card transactions for merchants, both of which are recognized when purchases are made by a cardholder and presented net of certain transaction-related costs. Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\nCertain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.\nCredit card revenue sharing agreements\nThe Firm has contractual agreements with numerous co-brand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years.\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange\nincome is earned.\nThe following table presents the components of card income:\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nInterchange and merchant processing income\n$ 28,085 $ 23,592 $ 18,563\nReward costs and partner payments (22,162) (17,868) (13,637)\nOther card income(a)\n(1,503) (622) (491)\nTotal card income $ 4,420 $ 5,102 $ 4,435\n(a)Predominantly represents the amortization of account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\nCard income is earned primarily by CCB, CIB and CB.

For financial instruments that are not measured at fair value, the related interest is included within interest income or interest expense, as applicable. Refer to Notes 12, 10, 11 and 20 for further information on accounting for interest income and interest expense related to loans, investment securities, securities financing activities (i.e., securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements; securities borrowed; and securities loaned) and long-term debt, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 8 - Pension and other postretirement\nemployee benefit plans\nThe Firm has various defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans that provide benefits to its employees in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. locations. Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants accounts based on their accumulated balances.\nThe Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their\ndependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firms Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan (the 401(k) Savings Plan), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firms significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, Defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nProjected benefit obligations $ (13,545) $ (18,046)\nFair value of plan assets 19,890 25,692\nNet funded status 6,345 7,646\nAccumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (1,916) (453)\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.\nGains and losses\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firms U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a\npension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firms U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plans projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and the discount rate.\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firms defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nPension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nTotal net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit)(a)\n$ (192) $ (201) $ (285)\nTotal defined contribution plans 1,408 1,333 1,332\nTotal pension and OPEB cost included in noninterest expense $ 1,216 $ 1,132 $ 1,047\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive (income)/loss $ 1,459 $ (1,129) $ (214)\n(a) Includes pension settlement loss of $92 million and $33 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans\nYear ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 2.54 % 2.17 % 2.93 %\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.68 % 2.97 % 3.91 %\nPlan assumptions\nThe Firms expected long-term rate of return is a blended weighted average, by asset allocation of the projected long-term returns for the various asset classes, taking into consideration local market conditions and the specific allocation of plan assets. Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan.\nThe discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally provided by the Firms actuaries, with the Firms principal defined benefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plans projected cash flows.\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation\nThe assets of the Firms defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the Firms principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and 0-12% alternatives as of December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets held by the Firms defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFair value measurement of the plans assets and liabilities\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Firm.\nPension plan assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nDefined benefit pension and OPEB plans\n2022 2021\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\nLevel 1(a)\nLevel 2(b)\nLevel 3(c)\nTotal fair value Level 1(a)\nLevel 2(b)\nLevel 3(c)\nTotal fair value\nAssets measured at fair value classified in fair value hierarchy $ 5,308 $ 9,617 $ 2,613 $ 17,538 $ 6,541 $ 12,315 $ 3,172 $ 22,028\nAssets measured at fair value using NAV as practical expedient not classified in fair value hierarchy 2,593 3,960\nNet defined benefit pension plan payables not classified in fair value hierarchy (241) (296)\nTotal fair value of plan assets $ 19,890 $ 25,692\n(a) Consists predominantly of equity securities, U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government debt securities, and cash equivalents.\n(b) Consists predominantly of corporate debt securities and U.S. federal, state, and local and non-U.S. government debt securities.\n(c) Consists of corporate-owned life insurance policies and participating annuity contracts.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nChanges in level 3 fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs\nInvestments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy decreased in 2022 to $2.6 billion, due to $501 million in unrealized losses and $54 million in settlements, and increased in 2021 to $3.2 billion, predominantly due to $332 million in unrealized gains, partially offset by $94 million in settlements.\nEstimated future benefit payments\nThe following table presents benefit payments expected to be paid for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for the years indicated.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans\n2023 $ 1,022\n2024 1,016\n2025 1,007\n2026 980\n2027 977\nYears 2028-2032 4,720\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 9 - Employee share-based incentives\nEmployee share-based awards\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted long-term share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the LTI Plans, and such plans constitute the Firms share-based incentive plans.\nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.\nPerformance share units (PSUs) are granted annually, and approved by the Firms Board of Directors, to members of the Firms Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firms achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chases common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material.\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employees full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.\nThe Firms policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.\nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nRSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by the stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously. The following table summarizes JPMorgan Chases RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2022.\nRSUs/PSUs SARs/Options\nYear ended December 31, 2022 Number of\nunits Weighted-average grant\ndate fair value Number of awards Weighted-average exercise price Weighted-average remaining contractual life\n(in years) Aggregate intrinsic value\n(in thousands, except weighted-average data, and where otherwise stated)\nOutstanding, January 1 45,405 $ 126.32 3,369 $ 116.62\nGranted 23,729 147.17 - -\nExercised or vested (19,517) 117.06 (858) 44.70\nForfeited (1,891) 141.74 - -\nCanceled NA NA - -\nOutstanding, December 31 47,726 $ 139.90 2,511 $ 141.19 7.8 $ 22,695\nExercisable, December 31 NA NA 261 46.58 0.1 22,695\nThe total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $3.2 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $75 million, $232 million and $182 million, respectively.\nCompensation expense\nThe Firm recognized the following noncash compensation expense related to its various employee share-based incentive plans in its Consolidated statements of income.\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCost of prior grants of RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options that are amortized over their applicable vesting periods $ 1,253 $ 1,161 $ 1,101\nAccrual of estimated costs of share-based awards to be granted in future periods, predominantly those to full-career eligible employees 1,541 1,768 1,350\nTotal noncash compensation expense related to employee share-based incentive plans\n$ 2,794 $ 2,929 $ 2,451\nAt December 31, 2022, approximately $1.0 billion (pretax) of compensation expense related to unvested awards had not yet been charged to net income. That cost is expected to be amortized into compensation expense over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. The Firm does not capitalize any compensation expense related to share-based compensation awards to employees.\nTax benefits\nIncome tax benefits (including tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents) related to share-based incentive arrangements recognized in the Firms Consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, were $901 million, $957 million and $837 million, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 10 - Investment securities\nInvestment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firms AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities.\nAFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nFor both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion and $104.5 billion of investment securities, respectively, from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains/(losses) of $(4.8) billion and $425 million, respectively, on the securities at the dates of transfer.\nUnrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.\nTransfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates indicated.\n2022 2021\nDecember 31, (in millions) Amortized cost(b)(c)\nGross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair\nvalue Amortized cost(b)(c)\nGross unrealized gains Gross unrealized losses Fair\nvalue\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nMortgage-backed securities:\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 77,194 $ 479 $ 6,170 $ 71,503 $ 72,800 $ 736 $ 993 $ 72,543\nResidential:\nU.S. 1,576 1 111 1,466 2,128 38 2 2,164\nNon-U.S. 3,176 5 27 3,154 3,882 25 1 3,906\nCommercial 2,113 - 155 1,958 4,944 22 17 4,949\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 84,059 485 6,463 78,081 83,754 821 1,013 83,562\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies 95,217 302 3,459 92,060 178,038 668 1,243 177,463\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities 7,103 86 403 6,786 14,890 972 2 15,860\nNon-U.S. government debt securities 20,360 14 678 19,696 16,163 92 46 16,209\nCorporate debt securities 381 - 24 357 332 8 19 321\nAsset-backed securities:\nCollateralized loan obligations 5,916 1 125 5,792 9,674 6 18 9,662\nOther 3,152 2 69 3,085 5,403 47 2 5,448\nTotal available-for-sale securities 216,188 890 11,221 205,857 308,254 2,614 2,343 308,525\nHeld-to-maturity securities(a)\nMortgage-backed securities:\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies 113,492 35 13,709 99,818 102,556 1,400 853 103,103\nU.S. Residential 10,503 3 1,244 9,262 7,316 1 106 7,211\nCommercial 10,361 10 734 9,637 3,730 11 54 3,687\nTotal mortgage-backed securities 134,356 48 15,687 118,717 113,602 1,412 1,013 114,001\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies 207,463 - 18,363 189,100 185,204 169 2,103 183,270\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities 19,747 53 1,080 18,720 13,985 453 44 14,394\nAsset-backed securities:\nCollateralized loan obligations 61,414 4 1,522 59,896 48,869 75 22 48,922\nOther 2,325 - 110 2,215 2,047 1 7 2,041\nTotal held-to-maturity securities 425,305 105 36,762 388,648 363,707 2,110 3,189 362,628\nTotal investment securities, net of allowance for credit losses $ 641,493 $ 995 $ 47,983 $ 594,505 $ 671,961 $ 4,724 $ 5,532 $ 671,153\n(a)The Firm purchased $33.7 billion, $111.8 billion and $12.4 billion of HTM securities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $96 million and $42 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(c)Excludes $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, included in accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAt December 31, 2022, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firms internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moodys,\nhowever the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuers ability to fulfill its obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nAFS securities impairment\nThe following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security.\nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI.\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral (pool losses) against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below AA at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\nHTM securities - credit risk\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities\nis calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the securitys effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security.\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\nCredit quality indicator\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\nAllowance for credit losses on investment securities\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $96 million, $42 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSelected impacts of investment securities on the Consolidated statements of income\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nRealized gains $ 198 $ 595 $ 3,080\nRealized losses (2,578) (940) (2,278)\nInvestment securities gains/(losses) $ (2,380) $ (345) $ 802\nProvision for credit losses $ 54 $ (36) $ 68\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nContractual maturities and yields\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at December 31, 2022, of JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.\nBy remaining maturity\nDecember 31, 2022 (in millions) Due in one\nyear or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years through 10 years Due after\n10 years(b)\nTotal\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ 14 $ 3,634 $ 4,534 $ 75,877 $ 84,059\nFair value 14 3,459 4,573 70,035 78,081\nAverage yield(a)\n2.21 % 3.58 % 5.25 % 3.62 % 3.71 %\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\nAmortized cost $ 16,335 $ 54,936 $ 17,749 $ 6,197 $ 95,217\nFair value 16,011 52,703 17,167 6,179 92,060\nAverage yield(a)\n1.27 % 3.00 % 3.99 % 6.01 % 3.08 %\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities\nAmortized cost $ 18 $ 47 $ 215 $ 6,823 $ 7,103\nFair value 18 46 216 6,506 6,786\nAverage yield(a)\n5.03 % 3.96 % 5.24 % 5.85 % 5.81 %\nNon-U.S. government debt securities\nAmortized cost $ 12,803 $ 3,228 $ 4,329 $ - $ 20,360\nFair value 12,795 3,107 3,794 - 19,696\nAverage yield(a)\n3.54 % 2.59 % 1.37 % - % 2.93 %\nCorporate debt securities\nAmortized cost $ 125 $ 272 $ 13 $ - $ 410\nFair value 76 268 13 - 357\nAverage yield(a)\n16.22 % 12.07 % 5.78 % - % 13.14 %\nAsset-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ 99 $ 1,517 $ 3,665 $ 3,787 $ 9,068\nFair value 95 1,487 3,605 3,690 8,877\nAverage yield(a)\n5.11 % 3.11 % 4.98 % 5.19 % 4.76 %\nTotal available-for-sale securities\nAmortized cost $ 29,394 $ 63,634 $ 30,505 $ 92,684 $ 216,217\nFair value 29,009 61,070 29,368 86,410 205,857\nAverage yield(a)\n2.34 % 3.05 % 3.94 % 4.01 % 3.49 %\nHeld-to-maturity securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ 98 $ 1,718 $ 12,350 $ 120,206 $ 134,372\nFair value 96 1,584 10,909 106,128 118,717\nAverage yield(a)\n5.54 % 2.23 % 2.56 % 2.93 % 2.89 %\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\nAmortized cost $ 34,157 $ 106,325 $ 66,981 $ - $ 207,463\nFair value 33,433 99,345 56,322 - 189,100\nAverage yield(a)\n0.57 % 0.71 % 1.27 % - % 0.87 %\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 106 $ 2,741 $ 16,951 $ 19,798\nFair value - 100 2,710 15,910 18,720\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 3.39 % 4.03 % 4.24 % 4.21 %\nAsset-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 30 $ 19,398 $ 44,311 $ 63,739\nFair value - 29 19,085 42,997 62,111\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 5.69 % 4.80 % 4.74 % 4.76 %\nTotal held-to-maturity securities\nAmortized cost $ 34,255 $ 108,179 $ 101,470 $ 181,468 $ 425,372\nFair value 33,529 101,058 89,026 165,035 388,648\nAverage yield(a)\n0.58 % 0.74 % 2.18 % 3.50 % 2.25 %\n(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b)Substantially all of the Firms U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately eight years for agency residential MBS, and six years for both agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 11 - Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively, securities financing agreements) primarily to finance the Firms inventory positions, acquire securities to cover short sales, accommodate customers financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firms excess cash.\nSecurities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.\nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firms credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nCredit risk mitigation practices\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.\nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firms policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firms securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets, and reduces the Net amounts presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the Net amounts below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts not\nnettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets(b)\nNet amounts(c)\nAssets\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n$ 597,912 $ (282,411) $ 315,501 $ (304,120) $ 11,381\nSecurities borrowed\n228,279 (42,910) 185,369 (131,578) 53,791\nLiabilities\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements $ 480,793 $ (282,411) $ 198,382 $ (167,427) $ 30,955\nSecurities loaned and other(a)\n52,443 (42,910) 9,533 (9,527) 6\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions) Gross amounts Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts presented on the Consolidated balance sheets Amounts not\nnettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets(b)\nNet amounts(c)\nAssets\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements\n$ 604,724 $ (343,093) $ 261,631 $ (245,588) $ 16,043\nSecurities borrowed\n250,333 (44,262) 206,071 (154,599) 51,472\nLiabilities\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements $ 532,899 $ (343,093) $ 189,806 $ (166,456) $ 23,350\nSecurities loaned and other(a)\n52,610 (44,262) 8,348 (8,133) 215\n(a)Includes securities-for-securities lending agreements of $7.0 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, accounted for at fair value, where the Firm is acting as lender.\n(b)In some cases, collateral exchanged with a counterparty exceeds the net asset or liability balance with that counterparty.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 12 - Loans\nLoan accounting framework\nThe accounting for a loan depends on managements strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., retained)\nLoans held-for-sale\nLoans at fair value\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firms loans by category:\nLoans held-for-investment\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees.\nInterest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\nNonaccrual loans\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.\nAllowance for loan losses\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firms Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firms accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.\nCharge-offs\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due.\nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances:\nLoans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.\nLoans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nresidential real estate and auto loans are charged off or charged down within 60 days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing).\nAuto loans upon repossession of the automobile.\nOther than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the government-guaranteed portion of loans.\nWholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firms claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrowers equity or the loan collateral.\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a brokers price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (exterior opinions), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (interior appraisals). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firms experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors.\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firms policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.\nLoans held-for-sale\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firms allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.\nLoans at fair value\nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.\nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.\nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firms allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.\nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firms elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nLoan classification changes\nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.\nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firms allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firms allowance for loan losses.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firms economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrowers debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.\nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firms established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firms asset-specific allowance.\nForeclosed property\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).\nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firms loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\nConsumer, excluding\ncredit card\nCredit card Wholesale(c)(d)\nResidential real estate(a)\nAuto and other(b)\nCredit card loans Secured by real estate\nCommercial and industrial\nOther(e)\n(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.\n(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note 14 for more information on SPEs.\nThe following tables summarize the Firms loan balances by portfolio segment.\nDecember 31, 2022 Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(a)(b)\n(in millions)\nRetained $ 300,753 $ 185,175 $ 603,670 $ 1,089,598\nHeld-for-sale 618 - 3,352 3,970\nAt fair value 10,004 - 32,075 42,079\nTotal $ 311,375 $ 185,175 $ 639,097 $ 1,135,647\nDecember 31, 2021 Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(a)(b)\n(in millions)\nRetained $ 295,556 $ 154,296 $ 560,354 $ 1,010,206\nHeld-for-sale 1,287 - 7,401 8,688\nAt fair value 26,463 - 32,357 58,820\nTotal $ 323,306 $ 154,296 $ 600,112 $ 1,077,714\n(a)Excludes $5.2 billion and $2.7 billion of accrued interest receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.\n(c)Excludes purchases of retained loans of $12.4 billion, $25.8 billion and $16.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firms standards.\nThe amount of purchases of retained loans at December 31, 2020 has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nGains and losses on sales of loans\nNet gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue was $(186) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 of which $(48) million was related to loans. Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments was $261 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 of which $253 million was related to loans. Net losses on sales of loans was $(36) million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nConsumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio\nConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nResidential real estate $ 237,561 $ 224,795\nAuto and other(a)\n63,192 70,761\nTotal retained loans $ 300,753 $ 295,556\n(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, included $350 million and $5.4 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:\nFor residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrowers continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrowers current or refreshed FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrowers credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\nFor scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nResidential real estate\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained residential real estate loans.\n(in millions, except ratios) December 31, 2022\nTerm loans by origination year(d)\nRevolving loans Total\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior to 2018 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans\nLoan delinquency(a)(b)\nCurrent $ 39,934 $ 66,072 $ 43,315 $ 15,397 $ 6,339 $ 49,632 $ 5,589 $ 9,685 $ 235,963\n30-149 days past due 29 11 14 20 20 597 15 208 914\n150 or more days past due 1 1 6 10 7 480 4 175 684\nTotal retained loans $ 39,964 $ 66,084 $ 43,335 $ 15,427 $ 6,366 $ 50,709 $ 5,608 $ 10,068 $ 237,561\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans(c)\n0.08 % 0.02 % 0.05 % 0.19 % 0.42 % 2.07 % 0.34 % 3.80 % 0.66 %\n(in millions, except ratios) December 31, 2021\nTerm loans by origination year(d)\nRevolving loans Total\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Prior to 2017 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans\nLoan delinquency(a)(b)\nCurrent $ 68,742 $ 48,334 $ 18,428 $ 7,929 $ 11,684 $ 49,147 $ 6,392 $ 11,807 $ 222,463\n30-149 days past due 13 23 27 27 22 578 11 182 883\n150 or more days past due - 11 21 25 33 1,069 6 284 1,449\nTotal retained loans $ 68,755 $ 48,368 $ 18,476 $ 7,981 $ 11,739 $ 50,794 $ 6,409 $ 12,273 $ 224,795\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans(c)\n0.02 % 0.07 % 0.26 % 0.65 % 0.47 % 3.18 % 0.27 % 3.80 % 1.02 %\n(a)Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(b)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.\n(c)Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firms allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential real estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average data) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)\n$ 3,745 $ 4,759\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(f)(g)(h)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 $ 2 $ 2\nLess than 660 - 2\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 174 37\nLess than 660 6 15\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 12,034 2,701\nLess than 660 184 89\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 215,096 209,295\nLess than 660 8,659 9,658\nNo FICO/LTV available 1,360 2,930\nU.S. government-guaranteed\n46 66\nTotal retained loans\n$ 237,561 $ 224,795\nWeighted average LTV ratio(f)(i)\n51 % 50 %\nWeighted average FICO(g)(i)\n769 765\nGeographic region(j)\nCalifornia $ 73,111 $ 71,383\nNew York 34,469 32,545\nFlorida 18,868 16,182\nTexas 14,961 13,865\nIllinois 11,293 11,565\nColorado 9,968 8,885\nWashington 9,059 8,292\nNew Jersey 7,106 6,832\nMassachusetts 6,379 6,105\nConnecticut 5,432 5,242\nAll other 46,915 43,899\nTotal retained loans\n$ 237,561 $ 224,795\n(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (Chapter 7 loans) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At December 31, 2022, approximately 5% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n(b)Nonaccrual loans exclude mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were not material at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(c)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n(d)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $175 million and $172 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(e)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $362 million, $866 million and $819 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.\nNature and extent of modifications\nThe Firms proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firms loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented.

The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.\nAt December 31, 2022, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nActive and suspended foreclosure\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $565 million and $619 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\nAuto and other\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained auto and other consumer loans.\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions, except ratios) Term loans by origination year Revolving loans\n2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Prior to 2018 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent\n$ 22,187 $ 20,212 (b)\n$ 11,401 (b)\n$ 3,991 $ 1,467 $ 578 $ 2,342 $ 118 $ 62,296\n30-119 days past due 263 308 100 68 33 17 12 10 811\n120 or more days past due - 53 24 - - 1 2 5 85\nTotal retained loans $ 22,450 $ 20,573 $ 11,525 $ 4,059 $ 1,500 $ 596 $ 2,356 $ 133 $ 63,192\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans(a)\n1.17 % 1.15 % 0.83 % 1.68 % 2.20 % 3.02 % 0.59 % 11.28 % 1.18 %\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions, except ratios) Term loans by origination year Revolving loans\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Prior to 2017 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent\n$ 35,323 (c)\n$ 18,324 (c)\n$ 7,443 $ 3,671 $ 1,800 $ 666 $ 2,242 $ 120 $ 69,589\n30-119 days past due 192 720 88 53 31 21 12 6 1,123\n120 or more days past due - 35 - - 1 1 5 7 49\nTotal retained loans $ 35,515 $ 19,079 $ 7,531 $ 3,724 $ 1,832 $ 688 $ 2,259 $ 133 $ 70,761\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans(a)\n0.54 % 0.47 % 1.17 % 1.42 % 1.75 % 3.20 % 0.75 % 9.77 % 0.71 % (d)\n(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, auto and other loans excluded $153 million and $667 million, respectively, of PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA that are 30 or more days past due.

Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.\n(c)Includes $4.4 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $1.0 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP.\n(d)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNonaccrual and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained auto and other consumer loans.\n(in millions) Total Auto and other\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)\n$ 129 $ 119\nGeographic region(d)\nCalifornia $ 9,689 $ 11,163\nTexas 7,216 7,859\nFlorida 4,847 4,901\nNew York 4,345 5,848\nIllinois 2,839 2,930\nNew Jersey 2,219 2,355\nPennsylvania 1,822 2,004\nGeorgia 1,708 1,748\nOhio 1,603 1,843\nLouisiana 1,576 1,801\nAll other 25,328 28,309\nTotal retained loans $ 63,192 $ 70,761\n(a)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, nonaccrual loans excluded $101 million and $506 million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $76 million and $35 million, respectively, were no longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines set by the SBA. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(d)The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2022.\nLoan modifications\nCertain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nThe impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit card loan portfolio\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.\nWhile the borrowers credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrowers credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The\ndistribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.\nThe Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)\nDecember 31, 2022\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans(a)\nTotal\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\nand still accruing\n$ 181,793 $ 696 $ 182,489\n30-89 days past due and still accruing\n1,356 64 1,420\n90 or more days past due and still accruing\n1,230 36 1,266\nTotal retained loans $ 184,379 $ 796 $ 185,175\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n1.40 % 12.56 % 1.45 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.67 4.52 0.68\n(in millions, except ratios)\nDecember 31, 2021\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans(a)\nTotal\nLoan delinquency\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\nand still accruing\n$ 151,798 $ 901 $ 152,699\n30-89 days past due and still accruing\n770 59 829\n90 or more days past due and still accruing\n741 27 768\nTotal retained loans $ 153,309 $ 987 $ 154,296\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.99 % 8.71 % 1.04 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.48 2.74 0.50\n(a)Represents TDRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia $ 28,154 $ 23,030\nTexas 19,171 15,879\nNew York 15,046 12,652\nFlorida 12,905 10,412\nIllinois 10,089 8,530\nNew Jersey 7,643 6,367\nOhio 5,792 4,923\nPennsylvania 5,517 4,708\nColorado 5,493 4,573\nArizona 4,487 3,668\nAll other 70,878 59,554\nTotal retained loans $ 185,175 $ 154,296\nPercentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660 86.8 % 88.5 %\nLess than 660 13.0 11.3\nNo FICO available 0.2 0.2\n(a)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at December 31, 2022.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firms long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nIf the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firms standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrowers line of credit.\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults\nThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions, except\nweighted-average data) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance of new TDRs(a)\n$ 418 $ 393 $ 818\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans - before TDR 19.86 % 17.75 % 18.04 %\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans - after TDR\n4.13 5.14 4.64\nBalance of loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(b)\n$ 34 $ 57 $ 110\n(a)Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification.\n(b)Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.\nFor credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firms standard charge-off policy.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nWholesale loan portfolio\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to high-net-worth individuals.\nThe primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.\nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligors debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligors earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firms internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moodys, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing managements assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firms definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligors ability to fulfill its obligations.\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios) Secured by real estate Commercial and industrial Other(b)\nTotal retained loans\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nLoans by risk ratings\nInvestment-grade $ 99,552 $ 92,369 $ 76,275 $ 75,783 $ 249,585 $ 241,859 $ 425,412 $ 410,011\nNoninvestment- grade:\nNoncriticized 23,272 22,495 81,393 62,039 57,888 52,440 162,553 136,974\nCriticized performing 3,662 3,645 8,974 6,900 1,106 770 13,742 11,315\nCriticized nonaccrual(a)\n246 326 1,018 969 699 759 1,963 2,054\nTotal noninvestment- grade 27,180 26,466 91,385 69,908 59,693 53,969 178,258 150,343\nTotal retained loans $ 126,732 $ 118,835 $ 167,660 $ 145,691 $ 309,278 $ 295,828 $ 603,670 $ 560,354\n% of investment-grade to total retained loans 78.55 % 77.73 % 45.49 % 52.02 % 80.70 % 81.76 % 70.47 % 73.17 %\n% of total criticized to total retained loans 3.08 3.34 5.96 5.40 0.58 0.52 2.60 2.39\n% of criticized nonaccrual to total retained loans 0.19 0.27 0.61 0.67 0.23 0.26 0.33 0.37\n(a)At December 31, 2021 nonaccrual loans excluded $127 million of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA, predominantly in commercial and industrial.

The allowance for credit losses comprises:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firms retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\nthe allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\nthe allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.\nThe Firms policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nMethodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firms allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date)\nversus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\nCollective and Individual Assessments\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.\nRelevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.\nRelevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms.\nThe majority of the Firms credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment (portfolio-based component). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments.\nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (asset-specific component). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.\nPortfolio-based component\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instruments expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firms estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\na weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firms central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firms macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties.\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\nAsset-specific component\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets.\nThe Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be\nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loans expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firms historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate managements expectation of the borrowers ability to repay under the modified terms.\nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for credit losses, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\nThe Firms central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at December 31, 2022\n2Q23 4Q23 2Q24\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n3.8 % 4.3 % 5.0 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)\n1.5 % 0.4 % - %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2021\n2Q22 4Q22 2Q23\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n4.2 % 4.0 % 3.9 %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)\n3.1 % 2.8 % 2.1 %\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b)The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates\nwill be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.\nRefer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 110-115, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126 for additional information on the consumer and wholesale credit portfolios.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 14 - Variable interest entities\nRefer to Note 1 on page 164 for a further description of JPMorgan Chases accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.\nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm considers a Firm-sponsored VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business Transaction Type Activity 2022 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB Credit card securitization trusts Securitization of originated credit card receivables pages 247-248\nMortgage securitization trusts Servicing and securitization of both originated and purchased residential mortgages pages 248-250\nCIB Mortgage and other securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgages, and other consumer loans pages 248-250\nMulti-seller conduits Assisting clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structuring transactions to meet investor needs page 250\nMunicipal bond vehicles Financing of municipal bond investments pages 250-251\nThe Firms other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each funds investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWMs interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCommercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CBs maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other third-party transaction.\nCorporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firms investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations\nCCBs Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the Trust). The Firms continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided sellers interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.\nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firms ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firms other continuing involvement with the\ntrusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.\nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firms other obligations or the claims of the Firms creditors.\nThe agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $6.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nreceivables owned by those trusts of approximately 62% and 57% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firms undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.\nFirm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firms only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firms maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.\nPrincipal amount outstanding JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in nonconsolidated VIEs(c)(d)(e)\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) Total assets held by securitization VIEs Assets\nheld in consolidated securitization VIEs Assets held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs with continuing involvement Trading assets Investment securities Other financial assets Total interests held by JPMorgan Chase\nSecuritization-related(a)\nResidential mortgage:\nPrime/Alt-A and option ARMs $ 55,362 $ 754 $ 37,058 $ 744 $ 1,918 $ - $ 2,662\nSubprime 9,709 - 1,743 10 - - 10\nCommercial and other(b)\n164,915 - 127,037 888 5,373 670 6,931\nTotal $ 229,986 $ 754 $ 165,838 $ 1,642 $ 7,291 $ 670 $ 9,603\nPrincipal amount outstanding JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in nonconsolidated VIEs(c)(d)(e)\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions) Total assets held by securitization VIEs Assets\nheld in consolidated securitization VIEs Assets held in nonconsolidated securitization VIEs with continuing involvement Trading assets Investment securities Other financial assets Total interests held by JPMorgan Chase\nSecuritization-related(a)\nResidential mortgage:\nPrime/Alt-A and option ARMs $ 55,085 $ 942 $ 42,522 (f)\n$ 974 $ 684 $ 95 $ 1,753\nSubprime 10,966 27 10,115 2 - - 2\nCommercial and other(b)\n150,694 - 93,698 671 3,274 506 4,451\nTotal $ 216,745 $ 969 $ 146,335 $ 1,647 $ 3,958 $ 601 $ 6,206\n(a)Excludes U.S. GSEs and government agency securitizations and re-securitizations, which are not Firm-sponsored.\n(b)Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables.\n(c)Excludes the following: retained servicing; securities retained from loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities; senior securities of $134 million and $145 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021,respectively, and subordinated securities which were not material at both December 31, 2022 and 2021, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIBs secondary market-making activities.\n(d)Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e)As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 84% and 79%, respectively, of the Firms retained securitization interests, which are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, were risk-rated A or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $2.6 billion and $1.6 billion of investment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $131 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2021; noninvestment-grade retained interests were not material at December 31, 2022. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $5.8 billion and $3.5 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $1.1 billion and $929 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(f)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities (controlling class). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.\nRe-securitizations\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firms consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firms role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies $ 16,128 $ 53,923 $ 46,123\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to re-securitization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the re-securitization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nNonconsolidated\nre-securitization VIEs\nDecember 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies\nInterest in VIEs\n$ 2,580 $ 1,947\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs.\nMulti-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy remote entities that provide secured financing, collateralized by pools of receivables and other financial assets, to customers of the Firm. The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with deal-specific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firms potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-specific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firms interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firms investments reflect the Firms funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $10.6 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nMunicipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (TOB) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates (floaters) and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests (residuals). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity providers obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\n(Termination Events), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity providers exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.\nHolders of the floaters may put, or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the\nliquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trusts purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.\nTOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nAssets Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2022\n(in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(c)\nTotal\nassets(d)\nBeneficial interests in\nVIE assets(e)\nOther(f)\nTotal\nliabilities\nVIE program type\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts $ - $ 9,699 $ 100 $ 9,799 $ 1,999 $ 2 $ 2,001\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits - 22,819 170 22,989 9,236 39 9,275\nMunicipal bond vehicles 2,089 - 7 2,096 1,232 10 1,242\nMortgage securitization entities(a)\n- 781 10 791 143 67 210\nOther 62 1,112 (b)\n263 1,437 - 161 161\nTotal $ 2,151 $ 34,411 $ 550 $ 37,112 $ 12,610 $ 279 $ 12,889\nAssets Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2021\n(in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(c)\nTotal\nassets(d)\nBeneficial interests in\nVIE assets(e)\nOther(f)\nTotal\nliabilities\nVIE program type\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts $ - $ 11,108 $ 102 $ 11,210 $ 2,397 $ 1 $ 2,398\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits 1 19,883 71 19,955 6,198 41 6,239\nMunicipal bond vehicles 2,009 - 2 2,011 1,976 - 1,976\nMortgage securitization entities(a)\n- 955 32 987 179 85 264\nOther - 1,078 (b)\n283 1,361 - 118 118\nTotal $ 2,010 $ 33,024 $ 490 $ 35,524 $ 10,750 $ 245 $ 10,995\n(a)Includes residential mortgage securitizations.\n(b)Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\n(c)Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d)The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $2.1 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arms-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\nTax credit vehicles\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.\nThe Firms maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion respectively.\nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firms creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firms securitization activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\n2022 2021 2020\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) Residential mortgage(d)\nCommercial and other(e)\nResidential mortgage(d)\nCommercial and other(e)\nResidential mortgage(d)\nCommercial and other(e)\nPrincipal securitized $ 10,218 $ 9,036 $ 23,876 $ 14,917 $ 7,103 $ 6,624\nAll cash flows during the period:(a)\nProceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments(b)(c)\n$ 9,783 $ 8,921 $ 24,450 $ 15,044 $ 7,321 $ 6,865\nServicing fees collected 62 2 153 1 211 1\nCash flows received on interests\n489 285 578 273 801 239\n(a)Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b)Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d)Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 28 for additional information about the Firms loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firms sale of certain excess MSRs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCarrying value of loans sold $ 48,891 $ 105,035 $ 81,153\nProceeds received from loan sales as cash\n$ 22 $ 161 $ 45\nProceeds from loan sales as securities(a)(b)\n48,096 103,286 80,186\nTotal proceeds received from loan sales(c)\n$ 48,118 $ 103,447 $ 80,231\nGains/(losses) on loan sales(d)(e)\n$ (25) $ 9 $ 6\n(a)Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt or retained as part of the Firms investment securities portfolio.\n(b)Included in level 2 assets.\n(c)Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans.\n(d)Gains/(losses) on loan sales include the value of MSRs.\n(e)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\nOptions to repurchase delinquent loans\nIn addition to the Firms obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 28, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically\nelects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firms repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.\nThe following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.\nThe goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally determined based on how the Firms businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nConsumer & Community Banking $ 32,121 $ 31,474 $ 31,311\nCorporate & Investment Bank 8,008 7,906 7,913\nCommercial Banking 2,985 2,986 2,985\nAsset & Wealth Management 7,902 7,222 7,039\nCorporate(a)\n646 727 -\nTotal goodwill $ 51,662 $ 50,315 $ 49,248\n(a)For goodwill in Corporate acquired in the third quarter of 2021, the Firm elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment, as permitted under U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning of period $ 50,315 $ 49,248 $ 47,823\nChanges during the period from:\nBusiness combinations(a)\n1,426 1,073 (c)\n1,412\nOther(b)\n(79) (6) (c)\nBalance at December 31, $ 51,662 $ 50,315 $ 49,248\n(a)For 2022, represents estimated goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Global Shares PLC in AWM, Frosch Travel Group, LLC and Figg, Inc. in CCB, and Renovite Technologies, Inc. and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB. For 2021, represents goodwill associated with the acquisitions of Nutmeg in Corporate, OpenInvest and Campbell Global in AWM, and Frank and The Infatuation in CCB. For 2020, represents goodwill associated with the acquisitions of cxLoyalty in CCB and 55ip in AWM.\n(b)Predominantly foreign currency adjustments.\n(c)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nGoodwill impairment testing\nThe Firms goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting units goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized\nfor the amount by which the reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Firm uses the reporting units allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firms annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firms Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.\nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firms overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or managements forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firms overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firms businesses and competitor institutions.\nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firms reporting units and JPMorgan Chases market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firms reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (OAS) model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firms prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2022 2021 2020\nFair value at beginning of period $ 5,494 $ 3,276 $ 4,699\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs 798 1,659 944\nPurchase of MSRs 1,400 1,363 248\nDisposition of MSRs(a)\n(822) (114) (176)\nNet additions/(dispositions) 1,376 2,908 1,016\nChanges due to collection/realization of expected cash flows\n(936) (788) (899)\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and other(b)\n2,022 404 (1,568)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to service)\n14 109 (54)\nDiscount rates\n- - 199\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)\n3 (415) (117)\nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions 17 (306) 28\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 2,039 98 (1,540)\nFair value at December 31, $ 7,973 $ 5,494 $ 3,276\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31,\n$ 2,039 $ 98 $ (1,540)\nContractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income 1,535 1,298 1,325\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions) 584 520 448\nServicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31, (in billions)(d)\n0.8 1.6 1.8\n(a)Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (SMBS) for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

The Firms credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCCB mortgage fees and related income\nProduction revenue $ 497 $ 2,215 $ 2,629\nNet mortgage servicing revenue:\nOperating revenue:\nLoan servicing revenue 1,582 1,257 1,367\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows\n(936) (788) (899)\nTotal operating revenue 646 469 468\nRisk management:\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a)\n2,022 404 (1,568)\nOther changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b)\n17 (306) 28\nChange in derivative fair value and other\n(1,946) (623) 1,522\nTotal risk management 93 (525) (18)\nTotal net mortgage servicing revenue 739 (56) 450\nTotal CCB mortgage fees and related income 1,236 2,159 3,079\nAll other 14 11 12\nMortgage fees and related income\n$ 1,250 $ 2,170 $ 3,091\n(a)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(b)Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).\nChanges in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.\nThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firms MSRs at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except rates) 2022 2021\nWeighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate)\n6.12 % 9.90 %\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse change\n$ (183) $ (210)\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse change\n(356) (404)\nWeighted-average option adjusted spread(a)\n5.77 % 6.44 %\nImpact on fair value of 100 basis points adverse change\n$ (341) $ (225)\nImpact on fair value of 200 basis points adverse change\n(655) (433)\n(a)Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 16 - Premises and equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. JPMorgan Chase computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of an asset. For leasehold improvements, the Firm uses the straight-line method computed over the lesser of the remainder of the lease term, or estimated useful life of the improvements.\nJPMorgan Chase capitalizes certain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software. Once the software is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the softwares expected useful life.\nImpairment is assessed periodically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable.\nNote 17 - Deposits\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits were as follows.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nU.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing (included $26,363 and $8,115 at fair value)(a)\n$ 644,902 $ 711,525 (b)\nInterest-bearing (included $586 and $629 at fair value)(a)\n1,276,346 1,359,932 (b)\nTotal deposits in U.S. offices 1,921,248 2,071,457\nNon-U.S. offices\nNoninterest-bearing (included $1,398 and $2,420 at fair value)(a)\n27,005 26,229\nInterest-bearing (included $273 and $169 at fair value)(a)\n391,926 364,617\nTotal deposits in non-U.S. offices 418,931 390,846\nTotal deposits $ 2,340,179 $ 2,462,303\n(a)Includes structured notes classified as deposits for which the fair value option has been elected.

These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firms ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firms collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables provide information related to the Firms operating leases:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted)\n2022 2021\nRight-of-use assets $ 7,782 $ 7,888\nLease liabilities 8,183 8,328\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.4 8.5\nWeighted average discount rate 3.55 % 3.40 %\nSupplemental cash flow information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows $ 1,613 $ 1,656\nSupplemental non-cash information\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 1,435 $ 1,167\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nRental expense\nGross rental expense $ 2,079 $ 2,086\nSublease rental income (119) (129)\nNet rental expense $ 1,960 $ 1,957\nThe following table presents future payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2022:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2023 $ 1,572\n2024 1,433\n2025 1,273\n2026 1,034\n2027 887\nAfter 2027 3,382\nTotal future minimum lease payments 9,581\nLess: Imputed interest (1,398)\nTotal $ 8,183\nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31, 2022, the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $588 million that were signed but had not yet commenced. These operating leases will commence between 2023 and 2026 with lease terms up to 21 years.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nFirm as lessor\nThe Firm provides auto and equipment lease financing to its customers through lease arrangements with lease terms that may contain renewal, termination and/or purchase options. The Firms lease financings are predominantly auto operating leases. These assets subject to operating leases are recognized in other assets on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to reduce the asset to its estimated residual value. Depreciation expense is included in technology, communications and equipment expense in the Consolidated statements of income. The Firms lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in other income in the Consolidated statements of income.\nOn a periodic basis, the Firm assesses leased assets for impairment, and if the carrying amount of the leased asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from the lease payments and the estimated residual value upon disposition of the leased asset, an impairment loss is recognized.\nThe risk of loss on auto and equipment leased assets relating to the residual value of the leased assets is monitored through projections of the asset residual values at lease origination and periodic review of residual values, and is mitigated through arrangements with certain manufacturers or lessees.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of assets subject to leases reported on the Consolidated balance sheets:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021\nCarrying value of assets subject to operating leases, net of accumulated depreciation\n$ 12,302 $ 17,553\nAccumulated depreciation\n4,282 5,737\nThe following table presents the Firms operating lease income and the related depreciation expense on the Consolidated statements of income:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease income $ 3,654 $ 4,914 $ 5,539\nDepreciation expense 2,475 3,380 4,257\nThe following table presents future receipts under operating leases as of December 31, 2022:\nYear ended December 31, (in millions)\n2023 $ 2,172\n2024 1,181\n2025 389\n2026 39\n2027 10\nAfter 2027 15\nTotal future minimum lease receipts $ 3,806\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 19 - Accounts payable and other liabilities\nAccounts payable and other liabilities consist of brokerage payables, which include payables to customers and payables related to security purchases that did not settle, as well as other accrued expenses, such as compensation accruals, credit card rewards liability, operating lease liabilities, income tax payables, and litigation reserves.\nThe following table details the components of accounts payable and other liabilities.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nBrokerage payables $ 188,692 $ 169,172\nOther payables and liabilities(a)\n111,449 93,583\nTotal accounts payable and other liabilities\n$ 300,141 $ 262,755\n(a) Includes credit card rewards liability of $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 20 - Long-term debt\nJPMorgan Chase issues long-term debt denominated in various currencies, predominantly U.S. dollars, with both fixed and variable interest rates.

The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $45.3 billion and $46.4 billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firms next call date, if applicable.\n(d)Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included $5 million and $12 million accounted for at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firms interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firms other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

In the second half of 2022, as a result of the expected increases in regulatory capital requirements, the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the Firm resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase program.\nThe following table sets forth the Firms repurchases of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021(a)\n2020(b)\nTotal number of shares of common stock repurchased 23.1 119.7 50.0\nAggregate purchase price of common stock repurchases $ 3,122 $ 18,448 $ 6,397\n(a)As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common stock dividends in the first and second quarter of 2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average of the Firms net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the normal capital distribution restrictions provided under the regulatory capital framework.\n(b)On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020.\nThe Board of Directors authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at managements discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firms capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares - for example, during internal trading blackout periods.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 58.9 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors compensation plans.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 23 - Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firms common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.\nThe following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions,\nexcept per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020\nBasic earnings per share\nNet income $ 37,676 $ 48,334 $ 29,131\nLess: Preferred stock dividends 1,595 1,600 1,583\nNet income applicable to common equity\n36,081 46,734 27,548\nLess: Dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities\n189 231 138\nNet income applicable to common stockholders\n$ 35,892 $ 46,503 $ 27,410\nTotal weighted-average basic shares outstanding\n2,965.8 3,021.5 3,082.4\nNet income per share $ 12.10 $ 15.39 $ 8.89\nDiluted earnings per share\nNet income applicable to common stockholders\n$ 35,892 $ 46,503 $ 27,410\nTotal weighted-average basic shares outstanding\n2,965.8 3,021.5 3,082.4\nAdd: Dilutive impact of SARs and employee stock options, unvested PSUs and nondividend-earning RSUs 4.2 5.1 5.0\nTotal weighted-average diluted shares outstanding\n2,970.0 3,026.6 3,087.4\nNet income per share $ 12.09 $ 15.36 $ 8.88\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 24 - Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\nAOCI includes the after-tax change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, foreign currency translation adjustments (including the impact of related derivatives), fair value changes of excluded components on fair value hedges, cash flow hedging activities, net gain/(loss) related to the Firms defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and fair value option-elected liabilities arising from changes in the Firms own credit risk (DVA).\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) Unrealized\ngains/(losses)\non investment securities Translation adjustments, net of hedges Fair value\nhedges Cash flow hedges Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans DVA on fair value option elected liabilities Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $ 4,057\n$ (707) $ (131) $ 63 $ (1,344) $ (369) $ 1,569\nNet change 4,123 234 19 2,320 212 (491) 6,417\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $ 8,180 (a)\n$ (473) $ (112) $ 2,383 $ (1,132) $ (860) $ 7,986\nNet change (5,540) (461) (19) (2,679) 922 (293) (8,070)\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 2,640 (a)\n$ (934) $ (131) $ (296) $ (210) $ (1,153) $ (84)\nNet change (11,764) (611) 98 (5,360) (1,241) 1,621 (17,257)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ (9,124) (a)\n$ (1,545) $ (33) $ (5,656) $ (1,451) $ 468 $ (17,341)\n(a)Includes after-tax net unamortized unrealized gains/(losses) of $(1.3) billion, $2.4 billion, and $3.3 billion related to AFS securities that have been transferred to HTM for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The remeasurement resulted in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. Refer to Note 8 for further information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 25 - Income taxes\nJPMorgan Chase and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chases expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.\nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firms businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firms final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.\nEffective tax rate and expense\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.\nEffective tax rate\nYear ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nIncrease/(decrease) in tax rate resulting from:\nU.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefit\n3.5 3.0 2.5\nTax-exempt income\n(0.9) (0.9) (1.6)\nNon-U.S. earnings\n0.4 0.1 1.4\nBusiness tax credits\n(5.4) (4.2) (5.4)\nOther, net\n(0.2) (0.1) 0.8\nEffective tax rate 18.4 % 18.9 % 18.7 %\nThe following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income.\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCurrent income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal $ 5,606 $ 2,865 $ 5,759\nNon-U.S. 2,992 2,718 2,705\nU.S. state and local 2,630 1,897 1,793\nTotal current income tax expense/(benefit)\n11,228 7,480 10,257\nDeferred income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal (2,004) 3,460 (2,776)\nNon-U.S. (154) (101) (126)\nU.S. state and local (580) 389 (671)\nTotal deferred income tax\nexpense/(benefit)\n(2,738) 3,748 (3,573)\nTotal income tax expense\n$ 8,490 $ 11,228 $ 6,684\nTotal income tax expense includes $331 million of tax benefits in 2022, $69 million of tax expenses in 2021, and $72 million of tax benefits in 2020, resulting from the resolution of tax audits.\nTax effect of items recorded in stockholders equity\nThe preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders equity. The tax effect of all items recorded directly to stockholders equity resulted in a decrease of $4.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.0 billion in 2021, and a decrease of $827 million in 2020.\nResults from U.S. and non-U.S. earnings\nThe following table presents the U.S. and non-U.S. components of income before income tax expense.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nU.S. $ 34,626 $ 50,126 $ 27,312\nNon-U.S.(a)\n11,540 9,436 8,503\nIncome before income tax expense\n$ 46,166 $ 59,562 $ 35,815\n(a)For purposes of this table, non-U.S. income is defined as income generated from operations located outside the U.S.\nThe Firm will recognize any U.S. income tax expense it may incur on global intangible low tax income as income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. At December 31, 2022 the income tax expense incurred was not material.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nAffordable housing tax credits\nThe Firm recognized $1.8 billion of tax credits and other tax benefits associated with investments in affordable housing projects within income tax expense for the year ended 2022, and $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The carrying value of these investments, which are reported in other assets on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets, was $12.1 billion and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of commitments related to these investments, which are reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets, was $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDeferred taxes\nDeferred income tax expense/(benefit) results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in managements judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. If a deferred tax asset is determined to be unrealizable, a valuation allowance is established. The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected in the following table.\nDecember 31, (in millions) 2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets\nAllowance for loan losses $ 5,193 $ 4,345\nEmployee benefits 1,342 987\nAccrued expenses and other\n8,577 3,955\nNon-U.S. operations 1,148 900\nTax attribute carryforwards 365 615\nGross deferred tax assets 16,625 10,802\nValuation allowance (198) (378)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance\n$ 16,427 $ 10,424\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDepreciation and amortization $ 2,044 $ 3,289\nMortgage servicing rights, net of hedges\n1,864 2,049\nLeasing transactions 2,843 4,227\nOther, net 3,801 4,459\nGross deferred tax liabilities 10,552 14,024\nNet deferred tax (liabilities)/assets $ 5,875 $ (3,600)\nJPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $365 million at December 31, 2022, in connection with U.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, FTC carryforwards, and state and local capital loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2022, total U.S. federal NOL carryforwards were $648 million, non-U.S. NOL carryforwards were $308 million, FTC carryforwards were $81 million, state and local capital loss carryforwards were $1.0 billion, and other U.S. federal tax attributes were $256 million. If not utilized, a portion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and other U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between 2026 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. Similarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will expire between 2026 and 2039 whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards will expire between 2029 and 2030, and the state and local capital loss carryforwards will expire in 2026.\nThe valuation allowance at December 31, 2022, was due to the state and local capital loss carryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAt December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chases unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties, were $5.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of which $3.8 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.0 billion. The change in the unrecognized tax benefit would result in a payment or income statement recognition.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at January 1, $ 4,636 $ 4,250 $ 4,024\nIncreases based on tax positions related to the current period\n1,234 798 685\nIncreases based on tax positions related to prior periods\n123 393 362\nDecreases based on tax positions related to prior periods\n(824) (657) (705)\nDecreases related to cash settlements with taxing authorities\n(126) (148) (116)\nBalance at December 31, $ 5,043 $ 4,636 $ 4,250\nAfter-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties related to income tax liabilities recognized in income tax expense were $141 million, $174 million and $147 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, in addition to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had accrued $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, for income tax-related interest and penalties.\nTax examination status\nJPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the Internal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities throughout the world, and by many state and local jurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table summarizes the status of significant income tax examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022.\nPeriods under examination Status\nJPMorgan Chase - U.S.\n2011 - 2013 Field examination of amended returns\nJPMorgan Chase - U.S.\n2014 - 2018 Field examination of original and amended returns\nJPMorgan Chase - New York State\n2012 - 2014 Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase - New York City\n2015 - 2017 Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase - U.K.\n2011 - 2020 Field examination of certain select entities\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 26 - Restricted cash, other restricted\nassets and intercompany funds transfers\nRestricted cash and other restricted assets\nCertain of the Firms cash and other assets are restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These restrictions are imposed by various regulatory authorities based on the particular activities of the Firms subsidiaries.\nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable limits.\nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at certain non-US central banks.\nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations established by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As part of its compliance with the respective regulatory requirements, the Firms broker-dealer activities are subject to certain restrictions on cash and other assets.\nThe following table presents the components of the Firms restricted cash:\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021\nSegregated for the benefit of securities and cleared derivative customers\n18.7 14.6\nCash reserves at non-U.S. central banks and held for other general purposes\n8.1 5.1\nTotal restricted cash(a)\n$ 26.8 $ 19.7\n(a)Comprises $25.4 billion and $18.4 billion in deposits with banks, and $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:\nCash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $42.4 billion and $47.5 billion, respectively.\nSecurities with a fair value of $31.7 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to customer activity.\nIntercompany funds transfers\nRestrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and its subsidiaries, from lending to JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Parent Company) and certain of its affiliates unless the loans are secured in specified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular affiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as covered transactions), must be made on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiarys total capital, as determined by the risk-based capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiarys total capital.\nThe Parent Companys two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the IHC). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chases subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Companys management or Board of Directors.\nAt January 1, 2023, the Parent Companys banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $34 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries earnings during the year.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 27 - Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized requirements, for the consolidated financial holding company. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firms principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach (Basel III Standardized), and an advanced approach (Basel III Advanced). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.\nThe three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:\nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators.\nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStandardized capital ratio requirements\nAdvanced capital ratio requirements\nWell-capitalized ratios\nBHC(a)(b)\nIDI(c)\nBHC(a)\nIDI(c)\nBHC(d)\nIDI(e)\nRisk-based capital ratios\nCET1 capital 12.0 % 7.0 % 10.5 % 7.0 % NA 6.5 %\nTier 1 capital 13.5 8.5 12.0 8.5 6.0 % 8.0\nTotal capital 15.5 10.5 14.0 10.5 10.0 10.0\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a)Represents the regulatory capital ratio requirements applicable to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 4.0% SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal banking agencies.\n(b)For the period ended December 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratio requirements under Basel III Standardized applicable to the Firm were 11.2%, 12.7% and 14.7%, respectively. SCB for Basel III Standardized ratio for 2021 was 3.2%.\n(c)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chases IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements include a fixed capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.\n(d)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.\n(e)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.\nThe following table presents the leverage-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nCapital ratio requirements(a)\nWell-capitalized ratios\nBHC IDI BHC(b)\nIDI\nLeverage-based capital ratios\nTier 1 leverage 4.0 % 4.0 % NA 5.0 %\nSLR 5.0 6.0 NA 6.0\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a)Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI subsidiaries, respectively.\n(b)The Federal Reserve's regulations do not establish well-capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nCECL regulatory capital transition\nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firms capital reflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firms CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.\nThe following tables present risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firms view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.\nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nOff-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments\nContractual amount Carrying value(i)\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nBy remaining maturity at December 31,\n(in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after\n1 year through\n3 years Expires after\n3 years through\n5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total\nLending-related\nConsumer, excluding credit card:\nResidential Real Estate(a)\n$ 5,156 $ 3,500 $ 6,542 $ 6,089 $ 21,287 $ 32,996 75 100\nAuto and other 10,642 1 - 1,588 12,231 12,338 - 2\nTotal consumer, excluding credit card 15,798 3,501 6,542 7,677 33,518 45,334 75 102\nCredit card(b)\n821,284 - - - 821,284 730,534 - -\nTotal consumer(c)\n837,082 3,501 6,542 7,677 854,802 775,868 75 102\nWholesale:\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit(d)\n83,832 132,237 201,921 22,417 440,407 453,467 2,328 (h)\n2,037\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(d)\n13,559 8,272 4,585 1,023 27,439 28,530 408 476\nOther letters of credit(d)\n3,692 343 98 1 4,134 4,448 6 9\nTotal wholesale(c)\n101,083 140,852 206,604 23,441 471,980 486,445 2,742 2,522\nTotal lending-related $ 938,165 $ 144,353 $ 213,146 $ 31,118 $ 1,326,782 $ 1,262,313 $ 2,817 $ 2,624\nOther guarantees and commitments\nSecurities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e)\n$ 283,386 $ - $ - $ - $ 283,386 $ 337,770 $ - $ -\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees 5,082 466 12,632 41,000 59,180 55,730 649 475\nUnsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 116,260 715 - - 116,975 103,681\n(2) 1\nUnsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 65,873 534 - - 66,407 74,263 (7) -\nLoan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:\nMortgage repurchase liability NA NA NA NA NA NA 76 61\nLoans sold with recourse NA NA NA NA 820 827 28 19\nExchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(f)\n191,068 - - - 191,068 182,701 - -\nOther guarantees and commitments (g)\n4,856 723 209 2,846 8,634 10,490\n53 69\n(a)Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b)Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c)Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $71 million and $44 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $8.2 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $512 million and $451 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.\n(e)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $298.5 billion and $357.4 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(f)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firms membership in certain clearing houses.\n(g)At December 31, 2022 and 2021, primarily includes unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, and other equity investment commitments.\n(h)At December 31, 2022, includes net markdowns on held-for-sale positions related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio.\n(i)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees\nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third partys failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off-balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),\nor other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firms risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 277.\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2022 2021\nDecember 31,\n(in millions) Standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees Other letters\nof credit Standby letters of credit and\nother financial guarantees Other letters\nof credit\nInvestment-grade(a)\n$ 19,205 $ 3,040 $ 19,998 $ 3,087\nNoninvestment-grade(a)\n8,234 1,094 8,532 1,361\nTotal contractual amount $ 27,439 $ 4,134 $ 28,530 $ 4,448\nAllowance for lending-related commitments $ 82 $ 6 $ 123 $ 9\nGuarantee liability 326 - 353 -\nTotal carrying value $ 408 $ 6 $ 476 $ 9\nCommitments with collateral $ 15,296 $ 795 $ 14,511 $ 999\n(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firms internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on internal risk ratings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSecurities lending indemnifications\nThrough the Firms securities lending program, counterparties securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as stable value products, that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterpartys reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.\nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firms maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firms view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n(in millions) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees $ 59,180 $ 55,730\nStable value contracts with contractually limited exposure\n31,820 29,778\nMaximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure\n2,063 2,882\nFair value\nDerivative payables 649 475\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nUnsettled securities financing agreements\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.\nLoan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications\nMortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firms mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.\nPrivate label securitizations\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.\nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.\nLoans sold with recourse\nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nor Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or guarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firms securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firms view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277.\nOther off-balance sheet arrangements\nIndemnification agreements - general\nIn connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (software licensees) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (third-party purchasers), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firms maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\nMerchant charge-backs\nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firms Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholders favor, the Firm will (through the cardholders issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,158.4 billion, $1,886.7 billion, and $1,597.3 billion, respectively.\nClearing Services - Client Credit Risk\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the clients positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member.\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firms Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIt is difficult to estimate the Firms maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nExchange & Clearing House Memberships\nThe Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firms contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing houses investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firms maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firms maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line.\nSponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICCs rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients respective obligations under the FICCs rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firms maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries\nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firms\ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (JPMFC), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firms unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 29 - Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets\nThe Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firms pledged assets.\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties $ 110.8 $ 126.3\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties 114.8 112.0\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 567.6 476.4\nTotal pledged assets $ 793.2 $ 714.7\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 14 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on the Firms securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on the Firms long-term debt. The significant components of the Firms pledged assets were as follows.\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021\nInvestment securities $ 104.4 $ 80.1\nLoans 485.9 428.5\nTrading assets and other 202.9 206.1\nTotal pledged assets $ 793.2 $ 714.7\nCollateral\nThe Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales, and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.\nDecember 31, (in billions) 2022 2021\nCollateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used $ 1,346.9 $ 1,471.3\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,019.4 1,111.0\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 30 - Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firms lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\nthe existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\nthe numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\nthe uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firms material legal proceedings.\n1MDB Litigation. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges dishonest assistance against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian courts jurisdiction to hear the claim.\nAmrapali. Indias Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (Amrapali). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under Indias Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation.\nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (FX) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firms settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on\nappeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Courts approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume.\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epsteins sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Associations (BBA) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for various currencies and the European Banking Federations Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR). The Swiss Competition Commissions investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\ndecision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firms settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.\nShareholder Litigation. Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firms resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\nenrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants motion to dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action.\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firms compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firms subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.\n* * *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firms legal expense was $266 million, $426 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firms consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chases income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNote 31 - International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major international geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firms U.S. operations serve international businesses.\nAs the Firms operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and assumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firms segment reporting as set forth in Note 32.\nThe Firms long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation to total assets. The majority of the Firms long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions) Revenue(b)\nExpense(c)\nIncome before income tax\nexpense Net income Total assets\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 18,765 $ 11,754 $ 7,011 $ 5,158 $ 558,430 (d)\nAsia-Pacific 10,025 6,763 3,262 2,119 281,479\nLatin America/Caribbean 3,178 1,697 1,481 1,156 78,673\nTotal international 31,968 20,214 11,754 8,433 918,582\nNorth America(a)\n96,727 62,315 34,412 29,243 2,747,161\nTotal $ 128,695 $ 82,529 $ 46,166 $ 37,676 $ 3,665,743\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 16,561 $ 10,833 $ 5,728 $ 4,202 $ 517,904 (d)\nAsia-Pacific 9,654 6,372 3,282 2,300 277,897\nLatin America/Caribbean 2,756 1,589 1,167 878 65,040 (e)\nTotal international 28,971 18,794 10,177 7,380 860,841\nNorth America(a)\n92,678 43,293 49,385 40,954 2,882,726 (e)\nTotal $ 121,649 $ 62,087 $ 59,562 $ 48,334 $ 3,743,567\nEurope/Middle East/Africa $ 16,566 $ 10,987 $ 5,579 $ 3,868 $ 530,687 (d)\nAsia-Pacific 9,289 5,558 3,731 2,630 252,553\nLatin America/Caribbean 2,740 1,590 1,150 837 63,853 (e)\nTotal international 28,595 18,135 10,460 7,335 847,093\nNorth America(a)\n91,356 66,001 25,355 21,796 2,537,664 (e)\nTotal $ 119,951 $ 84,136 $ 35,815 $ 29,131 $ 3,384,757\n(a)Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b)Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.\n(c)Expense is composed of noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.\n(d)Total assets for the U.K. were approximately $357 billion, $365 billion and $353 billion at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 32 - Business segments\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firms Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results of this footnote for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chases business segments.\nThe following is a description of each of the Firms business segments, and the products and services they provide to their respective client bases.\nConsumer & Community Banking\nConsumer & Community Banking offers products and services to consumers and small businesses through bank branches, ATMs, digital (including mobile and online) and telephone banking. CCB is organized into Banking & Wealth Management (including Consumer Banking, J.P. Morgan Wealth Management and Business Banking), Home Lending (including Home Lending Production, Home Lending Servicing and Real Estate Portfolios) and Card Services & Auto. Banking & Wealth Management offers deposit, investment and lending products, cash management, payments and services. Home Lending includes mortgage origination and servicing activities, as well as portfolios consisting of residential mortgages and home equity loans. Card Services issues credit cards and offers travel services. Auto originates and services auto loans and leases.\nCorporate & Investment Bank\nThe Corporate & Investment Bank, which consists of Banking and Markets & Securities Services, offers a broad suite of investment banking, market-making, prime brokerage, lending, and treasury and securities products and services to a global client base of corporations, investors, financial institutions, merchants, government and municipal entities. Banking offers a full range of investment banking products and services in all major capital markets, including advising on corporate strategy and structure, capital-raising in equity and debt markets, as well as loan origination and syndication. Banking also includes Payments, which provides payments services enabling clients to manage payments and receipts globally, and cross-border financing. Markets & Securities Services includes Markets, a global market-maker across products, including cash and derivative instruments, which also offers sophisticated risk management solutions, prime brokerage, and research. Markets & Securities Services also includes\nSecurities Services, a leading global custodian which provides custody, fund accounting and administration, and securities lending products principally for asset managers, insurance companies and public and private investment funds.\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial Banking provides comprehensive financial solutions, including lending, payments, investment banking and asset management products across three primary client segments: Middle Market Banking, Corporate Client Banking and Commercial Real Estate Banking. Other includes amounts not aligned with a primary client segment.\nMiddle Market Banking covers small and midsized companies, local governments and nonprofit clients.\nCorporate Client Banking covers large corporations.\nCommercial Real Estate Banking covers investors, developers, and owners of multifamily, office, retail, industrial and affordable housing properties.\nAsset & Wealth Management\nAsset & Wealth Management, with client assets of $4.0 trillion, is a global leader in investment and wealth management.\nAsset Management\nOffers multi-asset investment management solutions across equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market funds to institutional and retail investors providing for a broad range of clients investment needs.\nGlobal Private Bank\nProvides retirement products and services, brokerage, custody, estate planning, lending, deposits and investment management to high net worth clients.\nThe majority of AWMs client assets are in actively managed portfolios.\nCorporate\nThe Corporate segment consists of Treasury and Chief Investment Office (CIO) and Other Corporate. Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and managing the Firms liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\nOther Corporate includes staff functions and expense that is centrally managed as well as certain Firm initiatives and activities not aligned to a specific LOB. The major Other Corporate functions include Real Estate, Technology, Legal, Corporate Finance, Human Resources, Internal Audit, Risk Management, Compliance, Control Management, Corporate Responsibility and various Other Corporate groups.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nSegment results\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firms segment results as of or for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\nCapital allocation\nEach business segment is allocated capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segments performance.\nThe Firms allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.\nSegment results and reconciliation(a)\n(Table continued on next page)\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios) Consumer & Community Banking Corporate & Investment Bank Commercial Banking Asset & Wealth Management\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nNoninterest revenue $ 15,089 $ 17,286 $ 17,740 $ 35,999 $ 38,209 $ 35,120 $ 3,336 $ 3,929 $ 3,067 $ 12,507 $ 13,071 $ 10,822\nNet interest income 39,928 32,787 33,528 11,900 13,540 14,164 8,197 6,079 6,246 5,241 3,886 3,418\nTotal net revenue 55,017 50,073 51,268 47,899 51,749 49,284 11,533 10,008 9,313 17,748 16,957 14,240\nProvision for credit losses\n3,813 (6,989) 12,312 1,158 (1,174) 2,726 1,268 (947) 2,113 128 (227) 263\nNoninterest expense 31,471 29,256 27,990 27,087 25,325 23,538 4,719 4,041 3,798 11,829 10,919 9,957\nIncome/(loss) before income tax expense/(benefit)\n19,733 27,806 10,966 19,654 27,598 23,020 5,546 6,914 3,402 5,791 6,265 4,020\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n4,862 6,876 2,749 4,684 6,464 5,926 1,333 1,668 824 1,426 1,528 1,028\nNet income/(loss) $ 14,871 $ 20,930 $ 8,217 $ 14,970 $ 21,134 $ 17,094 $ 4,213 $ 5,246 $ 2,578 $ 4,365 $ 4,737 $ 2,992\nAverage equity\n$ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ 52,000 $ 103,000 $ 83,000 $ 80,000 $ 25,000 $ 24,000 $ 22,000 $ 17,000 $ 14,000 $ 10,500\nTotal assets 514,085 500,370 496,705 1,334,296 1,259,896 1,095,926 257,106 230,776 228,911 232,037 234,425 203,384\nReturn on equity\n29 % 41 % 15 % 14 % 25 % 20 % 16 % 21 % 11 % 25 % 33 % 28 %\nOverhead ratio 57 58 55 57 49 48 41 40 41 67 64 70\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n(Table continued from previous page)\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except ratios) Corporate Reconciling Items(a)\nTotal\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nNoninterest revenue $ (1,798) $ 68 $ 1,199 $ (3,148) $ (3,225) $ (2,560) $ 61,985 $ 69,338 $ 65,388\nNet interest income 1,878 (3,551) (2,375) (434) (430) (418) 66,710 52,311 54,563\nTotal net revenue 80 (3,483) (1,176) (3,582) (3,655) (2,978) 128,695 121,649 119,951\nProvision for credit losses\n22 81 66 - - - 6,389 (9,256) 17,480\nNoninterest expense 1,034 1,802 1,373 - - - 76,140 71,343 66,656\nIncome/(loss) before income\ntax expense/(benefit)\n(976) (5,366) (2,615) (3,582) (3,655) (2,978) 46,166 59,562 35,815\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\n(233) (1,653) (865) (3,582) (3,655) (2,978) 8,490 11,228 6,684\nNet income/(loss) $ (743) $ (3,713) $ (1,750) $ - $ - $ - $ 37,676 $ 48,334 $ 29,131\nAverage equity\n$ 58,068 $ 79,968 $ 72,365 $ - $ - $ - $ 253,068 $ 250,968 $ 236,865\nTotal assets 1,328,219 1,518,100 1,359,831 NA NA NA 3,665,743 3,743,567 3,384,757\nReturn on equity\nNM NM NM NM NM NM 14 % 19 % 12 %\nOverhead ratio NM NM NM NM NM NM 59 59 56\n(a)Segment results on a managed basis reflect revenue on a FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded within income tax expense/(benefit).

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n2022 versus 2021 2021 versus 2020\n(Unaudited) Increase/(decrease) due to change in: Increase/(decrease) due to change in:\nYear ended December 31,\n(On a taxable-equivalent basis; in millions) Volume Rate Net\nchange Volume Rate Net\nchange\nInterest-earning assets\nDeposits with banks:\nU.S. $ (1,185) $ 7,910 $ 6,725 $ 308 $ (383) $ (75)\nNon-U.S. 166 1,636 1,802 (42) (120) (162)\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements:\nU.S. 267 1,625 1,892 (66) (976) (1,042)\nNon-U.S. 311 1,471 1,782 75 (511) (436)\nSecurities borrowed:(a)\nU.S. 64 2,066 2,130 (84) 70 (14)\nNon-U.S. 69 423 492 (13) (56) (69)\nTrading assets - debt instruments:\nU.S. 375 1,509 1,884 (1,267) (259) (1,526)\nNon-U.S. (418) 775 357 481 32 513\nInvestment securities:\nU.S. 1,061 2,534 3,595 1,170 (2,474) (1,304)\nNon-U.S. (2) 207 205 (44) (136) (180)\nLoans:\nU.S. 2,988 6,750 9,738 600 (3,093) (2,493)\nNon-U.S. 148 1,328 1,476 355 (85) 270\nAll other interest-earning assets, predominantly U.S. 161 2,708 2,869 320 (449) (129)\nChange in interest income 4,005 30,942 34,947 1,793 (8,440) (6,647)\nInterest-bearing liabilities\nInterest-bearing deposits:\nU.S. 268 5,857 6,125 109 (1,496) (1,387)\nNon-U.S. 161 3,265 3,426 (55) (384) (439)\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements:\nU.S. (466) 3,327 2,861 (6) (635) (641)\nNon-U.S. 93 493 586 8 (151) (143)\nTrading liabilities - debt, short-term and all other interest-bearing liabilities:(b)\nU.S. 206 2,523 2,729 (43) (272) (315)\nNon-U.S. 125 756 881 112 19 131\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, predominantly U.S.\n(69) 212 143 (27) (104) (131)\nLong-term debt:\nU.S. 75 3,722 3,797 (64) (1,411) (1,475)\nNon-U.S. (31) 27 (4) (12) 5 (7)\nChange in interest expense 362 20,182 20,544 22 (4,429) (4,407)\nChange in net interest income $ 3,643 $ 10,760 $ 14,403 $ 1,771 $ (4,011) $ (2,240)\n(a)Negative interest and rates reflect the net impact of interest earned offset by fees paid on client-driven prime brokerage securities borrowed transactions.\n(b)Includes commercial paper.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2022 Form 10-K\nGlossary of Terms and Acronyms\n2022 Form 10-K: Annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nABS: Asset-backed securities\nAFS: Available-for-sale\nALCO: Asset Liability Committee\nAmortized cost: Amount at which a financing receivable or investment is originated or acquired, adjusted for accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash, charge-offs, foreign exchange, and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.\nCurrent estimated LTV ratio\nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available.

A substantial proportion of the Firms Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.\nSubprime\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrowers primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.\nMREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\nMSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights\nMulti-asset: Any fund or account that allocates assets under management to more than one asset class.\nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.\nNAV: Net Asset Value\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.\nNet interchange income includes the following components:\nInterchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions.\nReward costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions.\nPartner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.\nNet mortgage servicing revenue: Includes operating revenue earned from servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is recognized over the period in which the service is provided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the impact of risk management activities associated with MSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess mortgage servicing.
