    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world.

We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and certain local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC).

We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow, and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anytime, anywhere.\nWhile we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services, and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth areas:\nDigital Media-providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers and digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of flexible solutions that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device on projects of all types.\nDigital Experience-providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital marketing and advertising campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers,\nmerchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and sales and support executives. In fiscal 2017, we processed 186 trillion data transactions with our analytics products, providing our customers with a robust data platform that can be used to gain insight and optimize digital experiences delivered with our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobes business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue investing in engaging their constituents digitally.\nSEGMENTS\nEffective in fiscal 2018, our business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience (formerly Digital Marketing), and Publishing (formerly Print and Publishing). These segments provide Adobes senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Publishing business in a third segment that contains some of our mature products and solutions.\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2018 and beyond for each of our segments. See Results of Operations within Part II, Item 7 titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nDigital Media\nDigital Media Opportunity\nRecent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. In todays world where the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is ever increasing, customers are looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity by driving modernization and innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen engagement with communities, and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.\nThe flagship of our Digital Media business is Adobe Creative Cloud-a subscription service that allows members to use Adobes creative products integrated with cloud-delivered services across desktop, web and mobile devices. Creative Cloud members can download and access the latest versions of our creative products such as Photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Premiere Pro CC, Lightroom CC, InDesign CC, Adobe XD CC and many more creative applications. In addition, members can access built-in templates to jumpstart designs and step-by-step tutorials to sharpen skills and get up to speed quickly. Through Creative Cloud, members can access online services to sync, store, and share files across users machines, access marketplace, social and community-based features within our Adobe Stock and Behance services, and create apps and websites, all at affordable subscription pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nAdobe continues to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. A core part of our strategy is Adobe Sensei, a proprietary framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages Adobes massive content and data assets, as well as its deep domain expertise in the creative, marketing and document segments, within a unified artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning framework to tackle todays complex creative experience challenges.\nCreative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals such as artists, designers, developers, students and administrators. They rely on our products for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development, and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative products work in businesses ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, and individual freelancers. Moreover, our creative products are used to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers\nalso use our products to create and deliver content. We have introduced new products, features and services to address emerging categories of content creation such as 3D, augmented reality, virtual reality and user experience design. New solutions include Adobe Dimension, a tool that enables the creation of high-quality, photorealistic 3D images; Adobe XD, a solution for creating user experiences and screen designs as part of designing websites and mobile apps; and Adobe Spark, a set of capabilities that enables anyone to create impactful graphics, web pages and video stories in minutes.\nAdobes Digital Media segment includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated, cloud-based document services. Tens of millions of knowledge workers worldwide interact with documents daily. For over 25 years, Adobe Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide variety of tasks ranging from simple publications and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solutions. Users can turn slow, manual signing processes into automated experiences and collect signatures with Adobe Scan, Adobe Sign and Adobe Send & Track.\nDigital Media Strategy\nOur goal is to be the leading platform for creativity where we offer a range of products and services that allow individuals, teams and enterprises to design and deliver amazing digital content.\nWe believe there is significant opportunity for growth across all customer segments and expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users in North America and international markets. We will continue to seek to deepen our relationship with existing users through meeting their needs holistically and delivering additional features and value. As appropriate, we plan to optimize our pricing strategy and move our customers to higher priced and better value offerings and continue to employ targeted promotions that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. To target new customers and better address the needs of our existing customers, we will continue to invest in driving innovation to maintain the leadership position that we have established. We have also built a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize our Experience Cloud solutions to drive customer awareness and licensing of our creative products and services through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.\nWe offer many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including subscriptions to the Creative Cloud version of certain point products. We also offer a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist products such as Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements, Typekit and mobile apps such as Photoshop Mix, Photoshop Sketch, Photoshop Fix, Adobe Capture CC, and Adobe Spark. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under Principal Products and Services.\nIn our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are tens of millions of users who need the capabilities provided by Acrobat and the service capabilities found in Document Cloud. We plan to continue marketing the benefits of our Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world. We aim to increase our seat penetration in these markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We will continue to engage in strategic partnerships to help drive the business, including the recently announced Adobe Sign partnership with Microsoft. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets, while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader users. We intend to continue promoting the capabilities of our cloud-based document solutions to millions of Acrobat users and hundreds of millions of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe Sign services provide a green alternative to costly paper-based solutions, and are an easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. The Adobe Scan app for mobile devices can be used to capture paper documents as images and transform them into full-featured PDFs via Adobe Document Cloud services that can be shared immediately, essentially putting scanning capabilities in the pocket of every person. We believe that by growing the awareness of electronic signatures in the broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing to add new capabilities\nto our Adobe Scan and Sign offerings, we can help our customers migrate away from paper-based express mailing and adopt our solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\nDigital Experience\nDigital Experience Opportunity\nConsumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their digital interactions, across multiple channels and devices. As a result, businesses must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a digital world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impact success. Delivering the best experience to a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Executives are increasingly demanding solutions that optimize their consumers experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing and IT spend so they can demonstrate the success of their programs using objective metrics.\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. The worlds leading brands are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and development budgets toward digital experiences. As enterprises make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for vendors to help them navigate this transition. Enterprises need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across digital channels and in areas such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be consistent and personalized.\nOur Experience Cloud business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions that include analytics, targeting, advertising optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize digital experiences across channels for optimal performance.\nWe believe the market for Experience Cloud is rapidly expanding, and industry analysts predict more advertising dollars will be spent in digital than in traditional media in the future.\nDigital Experience Strategy\nOur goal is to be the leading provider of solutions that enable our customers to provide exceptional digital experiences. Our integrated cloud-based solutions enable enterprises to build personalized campaigns, manage advertising, and gain deep intelligence about their customers. Our content and data platform provides differentiation and competitive advantage.\nIn March 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as Adobe Marketing Cloud to our next generation offering referred to as Adobe Experience Cloud.\nAdobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:\nAdobe Marketing Cloud-provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target and Adobe Primetime.\nAdobe Analytics Cloud-enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.\nAdobe Advertising Cloud-delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (AMO) and Adobes acquisition of TubeMogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nWe believe the artificial intelligence and machine learning framework enabled by our strategy with Adobe Sensei enhances the delivery of digital experiences. By building on existing features such as Enhanced Anomaly Detection, Auto-Target, and other capabilities, we believe Adobe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.\nTo drive growth of Experience Cloud, we also intend to focus on customer engagement, partner leverage, and product differentiation. We utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, SIs and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. Strategic partnerships, such as the one we have formed with Microsoft, continue to increase our\nmarket reach. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Experience segment in fiscal 2018 and beyond.\nPublishing\nOur Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are well positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry.\nWe generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output devices. In fiscal 2017, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and license in our Publishing business.\nIn December 2017, in order to more closely align our Digital Experience business with the strategic growth opportunity, we moved two legacy enterprise software offerings from our Digital Experience segment to Publishing: our Adobe Connect web conferencing platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing and licensing these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales force. We have also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities based on our Adobe Experience Manager solution.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments, frequent product introductions, short product life cycles, price cutting with resulting downward pressure on gross margins and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance and better integrate our existing products, introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, provide best-in-class information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extend our core technology into new applications and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes.\nDigital Media\nNo single company has offerings that match the capabilities of our Creative Cloud products and services, but we face collective competition from a variety of point offerings, free products and downloadable apps. Our competition includes offerings from companies such as Apple, Autodesk, Avid, Facebook, Corel, Microsoft, Quark and others, as well as from many lower-end offerings. We believe our greatest advantage in this space is the performance and scope of our integrated solutions, which work together as part of Creative Cloud. With Creative Cloud, we compete favorably on the basis of features and functionality, ease of use, product reliability, value and performance characteristics.\nProfessional digital imaging, drawing and illustration products are characterized by feature-rich competition, brand awareness and price sensitivity. Competition in this space is also emerging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly evolving and highly volatile. In this area, we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.\nWe face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software or those of our competitors. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers will be encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.\nIn addition, the needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other\nnew devices. Our imaging and video offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition from established and emerging companies offering similar products.\nNew image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional tools are also emerging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense competition, including customer price sensitivity and competitor brand awareness. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging space from a number of companies whose market software competes with our offerings.\nThe stock content marketplace has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily operates today with our Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this segment include Shutterstock, Getty Images and a number of smaller companies. Adobe Stocks deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.\nThe nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web or via mobile applications. To address these competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emerging opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security, and have developed mobile solutions such as Adobe Scan.\nAs e-signatures are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors to Adobe Sign such as DocuSign have emerged. Partnerships and integrations between these companies and third-parties create an increasingly competitive landscape in this space.\nDigital Experience\nThe markets in which our Digital Experience business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense competition. Our Experience Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Marketo, Oracle, salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Verizon, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In addition, we compete at times with our customers or potential customers internally developed applications. Of the competitors listed above, no single company has products identical to our Experience Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud competes in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; audience management; advertising and real-time bidding technology; video delivery and monetization; web experience management and others.\nLarge software, internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital experience area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-cost alternatives based on many of these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.\nCreative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital experience technology to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital experience capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked closely with marketing and creative customers for over 30 years. We also believe we have leadership in this space, with current customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization and social capabilities in our Experience Cloud. Most importantly, we provide a vision for our digital experience customers as we\nengage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud to how they manage, deliver, measure and monetize their content with our Experience Cloud.\nPublishing\nOur Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies, as well as lower-end desktop publishing products. Similarly, our web conferencing product faces competition from a number of established products from other companies, including Cisco, Citrix and Microsoft. Competition involves a number of factors, including: product features, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interfaces.\nIn printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability, price, support and engineering development assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency, OEM customer relationships and our intellectual property portfolio.\nPRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nDigital Media Offerings\nCreative Cloud\nAdobe Creative Cloud is a cloud-based subscription offering that enables creative professionals and enthusiasts alike to express themselves with apps and services that connect across devices, platforms and geographies.

We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes, as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies and expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nA continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing solutions and the development of new solutions due to the speed of technological change that characterizes the software industry. We develop our software internally, as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owns the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expenses were $1.22 billion, $976.0 million and $862.7 million, respectively.\nPROTECTING AND LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS\nWe protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. Although our patents have value, no single patent is essential to any of our principal businesses. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights.\nOur enterprise customers license our hosted offerings as On-demand Services or Managed Services, and consumers primarily use our desktop software and mobile apps. We license our desktop software to users under \u2018click through or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication, disclosure, and transfer. Similarly, cloud products and services are provided to users under \u2018click through or signed agreements containing restrictions on access and use.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. We believe that our transition from perpetual-use software licenses to a subscription-based business model combined with the increased focus on cloud-based computing may improve our efforts to combat the pirating of our products.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of December 1, 2017, we employed 17,973 people. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge on our Investor Relations website at www.adobe.com/adbe as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Below we discuss some of the factors that could cause these differences. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, acquire, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\nThe process of developing and acquiring new technology products and services and enhancing existing offerings is complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop, acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. If we misjudge customer needs in the future, our new products and services may not succeed and our revenues and earnings may be harmed. Additionally, any delay in the development, acquisition, marketing or launch of a new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position.\nWe offer our products on a variety of hardware platforms. Consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. If we cannot continue adapting our products to tablet and mobile devices, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than us, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.\nOur competitive position and results of operations could be harmed if we do not compete effectively.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, new industry standards, evolving distribution models, limited barriers to entry, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Furthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness, and access to larger customer bases. As a result of these advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of our market share. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of our competitors. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may harm our results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled Competition contained in Part I. Item 1 of this report.\nIntroduction of new technology could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe expectations and needs of technology consumers are constantly evolving. Our future success depends on a variety of factors, including our continued ability to innovate, introduce new products and services efficiently, enhance and integrate our products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments. Integration of our products and services with one another and other companies offerings creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third parties. If any disruptive technology, or competing products, services or operating systems that are not compatible with our solutions, achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer and our business could be harmed.\nThe introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, gauge the performance of their advertisements, and detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or ad-blocking software or applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications that block cookies could harm our business.\nSome of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles, which can make our sales cycles unpredictable.\nSales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and ETLAs in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to several factors, including:\nthe need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;\nthe desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;\nthe need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;\nintensifying competition within the industry;\nthe negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;\nthe need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations due to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments within customers organizations; and\ncustomer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.\nWe spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarters total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry. Our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nSubscription offerings could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscription offerings ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which range from 1 to 36 months. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Any reduction in new or renewed subscriptions in a quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results until a later quarter. Declines in new or renewed subscriptions may decrease our revenue in future quarters. Lower sales, reduced demand for our products and services, and increases in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer-than-expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternative licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our subscription-based offerings prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated.\nIf our customers fail to renew subscriptions in accordance with our expectations, our future revenue and operating results could suffer.\nOur Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud, and Document Cloud offerings typically involve subscription based offerings pursuant to product and service agreements. Revenue from our subscription customers is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreements, which typically range from 1 to 36 months. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and customers may not renew their subscriptions at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their agreements prior to the expiration of the terms. Our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription-based agreements complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates.\nOur customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue enhancing features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription offerings, the prices of offerings and those offered by our competitors, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, decreases in the size of our customer base, reductions in our customers spending levels or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nSecurity breaches in data centers we manage, or third parties manage on our behalf, may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of employee and customer data, which could expose us to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business.\nWe process and store significant amounts of employee and customer data, most of which is hosted by third-party service providers. A security incident impacting our own data centers or those controlled by our service providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of this data. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of data stored by Adobe or our service providers may occur through break-ins, breaches of a secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers or employees. Accounts created with weak or recycled passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. Additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or the granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities, regulatory investigations, or fines. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.\nWe rely on data centers managed both by Adobe and third parties to host and deliver our services, as well as access, collect, use, transmit, and store data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, or failures in data collection or transmission could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.\nMuch of our business relies on hardware and services that are hosted, managed, and controlled directly by Adobe or third-party service providers, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud solutions. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offerings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm, costly and time intensive notification requirements, and cause us to lose customers and future business. Occasionally, we migrate data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments. If a transition among data centers or to third-party service providers encounters unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity, or unplanned disruptions despite precautions undertaken during the process, this may impair our delivery of products and services to customers and result in increased costs and liabilities, which may harm our operating results and our business.\nIt is also possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels or comply with regulatory notification requirements. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses, worms, or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation or regulatory investigation, and costly and time intensive notification requirements.\nWe may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. If we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the needs of our customer base, and we experience a rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data centers or those of third parties, service outages could occur and our customers could suffer impaired performance of our services. Such a strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject us to regulatory notification requirements, violations of service level agreement commitments, financial liabilities, result in customer dissatisfaction, or harm our business. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws could impact our business models and expose us to increased liability.\nU.S. privacy and data security laws apply to our various businesses. We also do business globally in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States that may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Globally, new laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability (and our enterprise customers ability) to reach current and prospective customers, to respond to both enterprise and individual customer requests under the laws (such as individual rights of access, correction, and deletion of their personal information), and to implement our business models effectively. These new laws may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). These requirements, among others, may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of more onerous obligations in our contracts. Any perception of our practices, products or services as a violation of individual privacy rights may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm, or investigations or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally, we store information on behalf of our customers and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws, it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us.\nTransferring personal information across international borders is becoming increasingly complex. For example, European data transfers outside the European Economic Area are highly regulated. The mechanisms that we and many other companies rely upon for European data transfers (e.g. Privacy Shield and Model Clauses) are being contested in the European court system. We are closely monitoring developments related to requirements for transferring personal data outside the EU. These requirements may result in an increase in the obligations required to provide our services in the EU or in sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other countries, including Australia and Japan, have also established specific legal requirements for cross-border transfers of personal information. These developments in Europe and elsewhere could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.\nMaintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach our data security systems and misused some of our systems and software in order to access our end users authentication and payment information. In addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms, credential stuffing attack tools, and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and operating system applications that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair a customers ability to operate or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate, notify affected parties of, or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us.\nOutside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems or attempt to gain logical access to our products, services, or information systems for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data. These actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, our customers or their end users, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation and liability or fines, our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirements, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand and reputation. These risks will likely increase as we expand our hosted offerings, integrate our products and services, and store and process more data, including personal information.\nThese problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on popular offerings with a large user base, and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in some of our applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing\nsecurity and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is used in a third-party attack, we could be subject to costly and time intensive notice requirements, and it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments or acquisitions, and integration of acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of an investment or acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:\ninability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\ndifficulty in, and the cost of, effectively integrating the operations, technologies, products or services, and personnel of the acquired business;\nentry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;\ninability to retain personnel of the acquired business;\ninability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\ninability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;\nincurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\nelevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;\nincreased accounts receivables collection times and working capital requirements associated with acquired business models;\nadditional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to a multinational corporation;\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\nimpairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;\nfailure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology;\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, such as claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\nincurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;\ninability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\ninability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions;\nthe failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections;\ndelay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and\nincompatibility of business cultures.\nMergers and acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky. If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles, how the principles are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting principles can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nChanges resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. For additional information regarding these updated standards, see the section titled Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective within Part II. Item 8, Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nSuch changes in accounting principles may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, or cause an adverse deviation from our revenue and profitability targets, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While, as of the balance sheet date, we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related\nto these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of and contributors to our online marketplaces for creative content.\nThe success of some of our product and service offerings, such as Adobe Stock, depends on our ability to continue to attract new customers and contributors to these online marketplaces for creative content, as well as our ability to continue to retain existing customers and contributors. An increase in paying customers has generally resulted in more content from contributors, which increases the size of our collection and in turn attracts new paying customers. We rely on the functionality and features of our online marketplaces, the size and content of our collection and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts to attract new customers and contributors and retain existing ones. New technologies may render the features of our online marketplaces obsolete, our collection may fail to grow as anticipated or our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.\nAs a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\nforeign currency fluctuations and controls;\ninternational and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;\ntax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\nchanges in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;\nchanges in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;\nfailure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;\ninadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\ndelays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;\nthe imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;\ncosts and delays associated with developing products in multiple languages;\noperating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and\nother factors beyond our control, such as terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.\nSome of our third-party business partners have international operations and are also subject to these risks and if our third-party business partners are unable to appropriately manage these risks, our business may be harmed. If sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are reduced, delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.\nWe are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally, which may harm our business.\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition, employee and third-party complaints, anti-corruption, gift policies, conflicts of interest, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. For example, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We cannot provide assurance that our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take actions in violation of our internal policies or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.\nIn addition, approximately 52% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs.\nUncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political conditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, more extended sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Among our customers are government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and our revenue could decline if spending cuts impact the governments ability to purchase our products and services. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nA disruption in financial markets could impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management and affect our derivative counterparties. Any of these events would likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPolitical instability or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights could result in lost revenues and ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business. We apply for patents in the U.S. and internationally to protect our newly created technology and if we are unable to obtain patent protection for the technology described in our pending patent, or if the patent is not obtained timely, this could result in revenue loss, adverse effects on operations, and harm to our business. We offer our products and services in foreign countries and we may seek intellectual property protection from those foreign legal systems. Some of those foreign countries may not have as robust or comprehensive of intellectual property protection laws and schemes as those offered in the U.S. In some foreign countries, the mechanisms to enforce intellectual property rights may be inadequate to protect our technology, which could harm our business.\nIf unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to lose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure\nagreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.\nWe may incur substantial costs defending against third parties alleging that we infringe their proprietary rights.\nWe have been, are currently, and may in the future be, subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation relating to disputes regarding the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention of management and key personnel. We may not prevail in every lawsuit or dispute. Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.\nWe may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates due to the global scope of our business. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We regularly review our program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and make adjustments as necessary. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure of our third-party customer service and technical support providers to adequately address customers requests could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur customers rely on our customer service support organization to resolve issues with our products and services. We outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We depend heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if these third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed, our ability to sell our offerings could be adversely affected, and we could lose customers and associated revenue.\nFailure to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.\nWe contract with a number of software distributors and other strategic partners, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. Nonetheless, if any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nSuccessfully managing our indirect distribution channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face legal risk and potential reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior.\nWe cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. If our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue. Our distributors also sell our competitors products and services, and if they favor our competitors products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer. In addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be unable to withstand adverse changes in\neconomic conditions, which could result in insolvency, the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services, or a delay in paying their obligations to us.\nWe also sell some of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel include more extended sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of ongoing training for sales representatives. Moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.\nContracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process.\nWe provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include more extended sales and collection cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation and financial results.\nRevenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nIn the past, the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and it may do so in the future. A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, such as:\nshortfalls in, or changes in expectations about our revenue, margins, earnings, Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), sales of our Adobe Experience Cloud offerings, or other key performance metrics;\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\nwhether our results meet analysts expectations;\ncompression or expansion of multiples used by investors and analysts to value high technology SaaS companies;\nthe announcement of new products or services, product enhancements, service introductions, strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or our competitors;\nthe loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers;\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\nvariations in our or our competitors results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry;\ngeneral socio-economic, political or market conditions; and\nunusual events such as significant acquisitions by us or our competitors, divestitures, litigation, regulatory actions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nIn addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general may experience uneven investor confidence, which may cause the market price for our common stock to decline for reasons unrelated to our operating performance. Volatility in the market price of a companys securities for a period of time may increase the companys susceptibility to securities class action litigation. Oftentimes, this type of litigation is expensive and diverts managements attention and resources which may adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially if we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. We may experience higher compensation costs to retain senior management and experienced personnel that may not be offset by improved productivity or increased sales. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.\nWe continue to hire personnel in countries where exceptional technical knowledge and other expertise are offered at lower costs, which increases the efficiency of our global workforce structure and reduces our personnel related expenditures. Nonetheless, as globalization continues, competition for these employees in these countries has increased, which may impact our ability to retain these employees and increase our expenses resulting from competitive compensation. We may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities, which would require significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, causing our results to suffer.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, then we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nGAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. In addition, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. Depending on the results of our review, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nWe have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. We also have a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nOur senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured revolving credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such financing and restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nWe are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and website for our development, marketing, operations, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California, Utah and India are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, we have the potential to experience losses to our business, and added costs to resume operations.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.\nOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 1, 2017 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, foreign government securities and U.S. Treasury securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.\nShould financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of December 1, 2017, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions, market liquidity or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired.

The remaining square footage is subleased.\nIn general, all facilities are in good condition, suitable for the conduct of our business and are operating at an average capacity of approximately 83%. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and, based on known facts, assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\nIn connection with our piracy conversion efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADBE.

Because many of such shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBelow is a summary of stock repurchases for the three months ended December 1, 2017.

As of December 1, 2017, approximately $101.5 million of the prepayment remained under this agreement. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nThe following selected consolidated financial data (presented in thousands, except per share amounts and employee data) is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The new standard was adopted prospectively starting fiscal 2015. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nACQUISITIONS\nDuring fiscal 2017, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company, for $560.8 million. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment.\nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, perpetual and term-based licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer. Throughout the contract period, customers use our solutions to complete various phases of the creative and/or marketing processes allowing them to concurrently work on multiple projects. In response to evolving customer and market expectations, we frequently expand and improve our technology to keep up with the pace of change, to provide enhancements to our tools to meet industry needs and to provide support at each stage of the customers life cycle.\nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; we have delivered the product or performed the service; the fee is fixed or determinable; and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire\narrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (BESP), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nProduct revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, rebates and price protection at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nIn the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.\nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from such examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, by unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, in the United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business, we are subject to potential changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These countries and other governmental bodies have or could make unprecedented assertions about how earnings in their jurisdictions might be determined that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. In the current global tax policy environment, any changes in laws, regulations and interpretations related to these assertions could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nMoreover, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from these examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of 2017\nFor fiscal 2017, we reported strong financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud delivers value through frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals, students, teams and enterprises. We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained long-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users on account of Creative Clouds low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and grow a recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs), revenue from perpetual licensing of our Creative products has been immaterial to our business.\nWe are also a market leader with our Adobe Document Cloud offerings built around our Adobe Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe Sign. Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2017 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2017 and held constant throughout the year. We calculate ARR as follows:\nCreative ARR\nAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services\n+\nAnnual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value\n+\nAnnual Creative ETLA Contract Value\nDocument Cloud ARR\nAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services\n+\nAnnual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\nDigital Media ARR\nCreative ARR\n+\nDocument Cloud ARR\nCreative ARR exiting fiscal 2017 was $4.63 billion, up from $3.52 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2017 was $600 million, up from $472 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $5.23 billion at the end of fiscal 2017, up from $3.99 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2017 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2018, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2017 would be $5.39 billion or approximately $154 million higher than the ARR reported above.\nOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2017 was $4.17 billion, up from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 31% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2017 was $836.7 million, up from $764.9 million in fiscal 2016 and representing 9% year-over-year revenue growth as we continue to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $5.01 billion in fiscal 2017, up from $3.94 billion in fiscal 2016 and representing 27% year-over-year growth.\nWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Digital Marketing business provides comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. These comprehensive solutions enable marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. In March 2017, we migrated our hierarchy of solutions under what was formerly known as Adobe Marketing Cloud to our next generation offering referred to as Adobe Experience Cloud.\nAdobe Experience Cloud consists of the following cloud offerings:\nAdobe Marketing Cloud-provides an integrated set of solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers, helping businesses manage, personalize, and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys; includes Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), Adobe Campaign, Adobe Target, Adobe Social and Adobe Primetime.\nAdobe Analytics Cloud-enables businesses to move from insights to actions in real time by uniquely integrating audiences as the core system of intelligence for the enterprise; makes data available across all Adobe clouds through the capture, aggregation, rationalization and understanding of vast amounts of disparate data and then translating that data into singular customer profiles; includes Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager.\nAdobe Advertising Cloud-delivers an end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats, and simplifies the delivery of video, display and search advertising across channels and screens; combines capabilities from Adobe Media Optimizer (AMO) and Adobes acquisition of TubeMogul during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIn addition to chief marketing officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, digital marketers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers and marketing executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.03 billion in fiscal 2017, which represents 24% year-over-year growth.\nFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2017\nTotal Digital Media ARR of approximately $5.23 billion as of December 1, 2017 increased by $1.24 billion, or 31%, from $3.99 billion as of December 2, 2016. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to strong adoption of our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud offerings.\nCreative revenue of $4.17 billion increased by $997.8 million, or 31%, during fiscal 2017, from $3.18 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings.\nAdobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.03 billion increased by $398.9 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2017, from $1.63 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in revenue associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and increases in subscription revenue associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings, including AEM and Adobe Campaign.\nOur total deferred revenue of $2.49 billion as of December 1, 2017 increased by $479.8 million, or 24%, from $2.01 billion as of December 2, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud team and individual subscriptions, and new contracts and the timing of renewals for our Adobe Experience Cloud services.\nCost of revenue of $1.01 billion increased by $190.6 million, or 23%, during fiscal 2017, from $819.9 million in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in media costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, data center and hosting costs and increased headcount.\nOperating expenses of $4.12 billion increased by $582.0 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2017, from $3.54 billion in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased headcount and stock based compensation expense.\nNet income of $1.69 billion increased by $525.2 million, or 45%, during fiscal 2017 from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in subscription revenue.\nNet cash flow from operations of $2.91 billion during fiscal 2017 increased by $713.1 million, or 32%, from $2.20 billion during fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher net income.\nRevenue (dollars in millions)\nRevenue for fiscal 2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2017 and 2015, which were 52-week years.\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2017-2016\n% Change\n2016-2015\nSubscription\n$\n6,133.9\n$\n4,584.8\n$\n3,223.9\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nProduct\n706.7\n800.5\n1,125.1\n(12\n)%\n(29\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nServices and support\n460.9\n469.1\n446.5\n(2\n)%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n7,301.5\n$\n5,854.4\n$\n4,795.5\n%\n%\nOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in individual, team and enterprise subscriptions. Also contributing to the increase in revenue was revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering.\nAdobe Document Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in Document Cloud subscriptions revenue, offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetually licensed Acrobat offering. Also contributing to the increase in Document Cloud revenue was an increase in Adobe Sign revenue.\nDigital Marketing\nRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $383.4 million during fiscal 2017, as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by strong performance with our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings, which include AEM and Adobe Campaign, and our Adobe Analytics Cloud offerings, which includes Audience Manager. Also contributing to the increase in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue were increases in revenue associated with our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings, including Tubemogul which we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2016 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2015 Revenue\nDigital Media\nRevenue from Digital Media increased $845.8 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings.\nRevenue associated with our creative offerings, which includes our Creative Cloud, perpetually licensed creative and stock photography offerings, increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, and continued adoption of our ETLAs. To a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with our Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscription offering and stock photography offerings also contributed to the increase in revenue associated with our creative offerings. Increases associated with our creative offerings were slightly offset by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings and distribution of third-party software downloads.\nDocument Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family and Adobe Sign service, decreased slightly during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, primarily due to expected decreases in revenue associated with our Acrobat perpetual license offering. Decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud subscription offerings as we continue to migrate more customers to our Document Cloud, along with increases in Adobe Sign revenue.\nDigital Marketing\nRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $227.7 million during fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Experience Cloud, which increased 20% year over year. Increases in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue were largely driven by the continued adoption of our AEM offerings and, to a lesser extent, the increase in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Marketing revenue was the increase in Adobe Analytics Cloud revenue.\nGeographical Information (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2017-2016\n% Change\n2016-2015\nAmericas\n$\n4,216.5\n$\n3,400.1\n$\n2,788.1\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nEMEA\n1,985.1\n1,619.2\n1,336.4\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nAPAC\n1,099.9\n835.1\n671.0\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n7,301.5\n$\n5,854.4\n$\n4,795.5\n%\n%\nFiscal 2017 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2016 Revenue by Geography\nOverall revenue during fiscal 2017 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to increases in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Within each geographic region, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Further, the overall increase in EMEA revenue was slightly offset by declines due to the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar against EMEA currencies as discussed below.\nFiscal 2016 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2015 Revenue by Geography\nOverall revenue during fiscal 2016 increased in all geographic regions as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to increases in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue, slightly offset by a decrease in Print and Publishing revenue. Within each geographic region, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. Further, the overall increase in EMEA revenue was partially offset by declines due to the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar against EMEA currencies as discussed below.\nIncluded in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.\n(in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nRevenue impact:\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nEuro\n$\n(2.3\n)\n$\n(50.2\n)\nBritish Pound\n(46.1\n)\n(36.2\n)\nJapanese Yen\n4.0\n15.0\nOther currencies\n6.1\n(21.7\n)\nTotal revenue impact\n(38.3\n)\n(93.1\n)\nHedging impact:\nEuro\n13.7\n4.2\nBritish Pound\n7.1\n14.5\nJapanese Yen\n12.1\n0.1\nTotal hedging impact\n32.9\n18.8\nTotal impact\n$\n(5.4\n)\n$\n(74.3\n)\nDuring fiscal 2017, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. The net foreign currency impact to revenue was offset in part by hedging gains from our EMEA and Japanese Yen currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro and British Pound which negatively impacted revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents. This impact was partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA currencies hedging programs during fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Japanese Yen, the impact of which was offset by the impact of the U.S. Dollar strengthening against other Asian currencies.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.\nBacklog\nDeferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions and does not represent the total contract value of existing annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings that are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of December 1, 2017, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.94 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2018. Comparatively, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $3.42 billion as of December 2, 2016, of which approximately 40% to 50% was not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2017.\nWe expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscriptions, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.\nCost of Revenue (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2017-2016\n% Change\n2016-2015\nSubscription\n$\n623.0\n$\n461.9\n$\n409.2\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nProduct\n57.1\n68.9\n90.0\n(17\n)%\n(23\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nServices and support\n330.4\n289.1\n245.1\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n1,010.5\n$\n819.9\n$\n744.3\n%\n%\nSubscription\nCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of certain intangible assets and allocated overhead.

The decreases associated with certain fully amortized acquired intangible assets from previous acquisitions were offset by increases associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of TubeMogul in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAmortization expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the write-off of certain acquired intangible assets from a previous acquisition and the increase in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased in fiscal 2016.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2017-2016\n% Change\n2016-2015\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n$\n36.4\n$\n13.5\n$\n33.9\n%\n(60\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n**\n**\n**\nInterest expense\n(74.4\n)\n(70.4\n)\n(64.2\n)\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n(1\n)%\n(1\n)%\n(1\n)%\nInvestment gains (losses), net\n7.5\n(1.6\n)\n1.0\n*\n*\nPercentage of total revenue\n**\n**\n**\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\n$\n(30.5\n)\n$\n(58.5\n)\n$\n(29.3\n)\n(48\n)%\n%\n_________________________________________\n(*) Percentage is not meaningful.\n(**) Percentage is less than 1%.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.\nInterest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 due to higher average invested balances and interest rates and a decline in foreign exchange hedging costs.\nInterest and other income (expense), net decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 due to a gain on the sale of certain property assets that occurred in fiscal 2015 and an increase in foreign exchange hedging costs, offset in part by an increase in interest income due to higher average invested balances and interest rates.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments. See Notes 5 and 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.\nInterest expense increased during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher short-term floating interest rates on interest rate swaps.\nInterest expense increased during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher short-term floating interest rates on interest rate swaps and higher average debt balances.\nInvestment Gains (Losses), Net\nInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets which are classified as trading securities, and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.\nProvision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2017-2016\n% Change\n2016-2015\nProvision\n$\n443.7\n$\n266.4\n$\n244.2\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\n%\nAs described in Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we early adopted the updated accounting standard for share-based payment accounting during fiscal 2017. As a result, we recorded deferred tax attributes that we were previously tracking pursuant to the rules that preceded this standard. The deferred tax asset recorded with the adoption was offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance.\nOur effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. The increase was partially related to a one-time tax cost associated with licensing acquired company assets to our trading subsidiaries, offset in part by the recognition of excess tax benefits due to our adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation and the completion of certain income tax examinations. In addition to the above noted items, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 included tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations, and to a lesser extent, a one-time tax benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the fiscal 2015 U.S. Research and Development credit.\nOur effective tax rate decreased by approximately nine percentage points during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations and the permanent extension of the U.S. Research and Development credit for 2015 and onward. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2015. A tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2015 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was partially offset by stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2016. In addition, the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate included one-time tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobes trading companies, offset by tax benefits for the temporary reinstatement of the U.S. Research and Development credit in December 2014.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year was earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings as of the balance sheet date, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there is a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided.\nSee Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nThe gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties were $172.9 million, $178.4 million and $258.7 million for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which, $135.0 million, $144.5 million and $220.2 million if recognized, would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were net of the estimated $37.9 million, $33.9 million and $38.5 million federal benefits related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts were included in non-current income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of\n(in millions)\nDecember 1, 2017\nDecember 2, 2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,306.1\n$\n1,011.3\nShort-term investments\n$\n3,513.7\n$\n3,750.0\nWorking capital\n$\n3,720.4\n$\n3,028.1\nStockholders equity\n$\n8,459.9\n$\n7,424.8\nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\n(in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,912.9\n$\n2,199.7\n$\n1,469.5\nNet cash used for investing activities\n(442.9\n)\n(960.0\n)\n(1,488.4\n)\nNet cash used for financing activities\n(1,183.7\n)\n(1,090.7\n)\n(200.7\n)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n8.5\n(14.2\n)\n(21.2\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,294.8\n$\n134.8\n$\n(240.8\n)\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.91 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by headcount growth, and increased accrued media costs associated with our Advertising Cloud offerings, including TubeMogul. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, payments of trade payables assumed as part of the TubeMogul acquisition, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to revenue linearity, higher revenue levels, and increased media rebill receivables attributable to TubeMogul. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to taxes paid in excess of the tax provision increase.\nFor fiscal 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $2.20 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in accrued expenses is primarily due to the increase in accruals for compensation costs and employee benefits driven by the increase in headcount. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease in income taxes payable. Trade receivables increased primarily due to higher revenue levels. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased\nprimarily due to advanced tax payments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to the completion of certain income tax audits in fiscal 2016, offset in part by increases to the tax provision in excess of taxes paid.\nFor fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in income taxes payable was primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash used for investing activities of $442.9 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of TubeMogul. Other uses of cash included purchases of property and equipment, including the Almaden Tower and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.\nFor fiscal 2016, net cash used for investing activities of $960.0 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments. Other uses of cash represented purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets, and an immaterial acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.\nFor fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets.\nSee Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions and the Almaden Tower purchase, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor fiscal 2017, net cash used for financing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock.\nFor fiscal 2016, net cash used for financing activities of $1.09 billion was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nIn January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\nWe used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (2015 Notes). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information.\nIn addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 included payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled Stock Repurchase Program discussed below.\nWe expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.\nOther Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations\nOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2018 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and\ninvestments totaled $5.82 billion as of December 1, 2017. Of this amount, approximately 89% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. As of our balance sheet date, our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings amount of approximately $4 billion are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify approximately $380 million of deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years. In addition, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate a tax provision charge of approximately $85 million in fiscal 2018 predominately due to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings.\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nOn March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of December 1, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.\nAs of December 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 Notes, the Notes).\nOur short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash.\nStock Repurchase Program\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019.\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nThe financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017, December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $300 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.6 billion remains under our current authority.\nSee Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended December 1, 2017.\nSummary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015\n(in thousands, except average amounts)\nBoard Approval\nDate\nRepurchases\nUnder the Plan (1)\nShares\nAverage\nShares\nAverage\nShares\nAverage\nApril 2012\nStructured repurchases\n-\n$\n-\n-\n$\n-\n3,255\n$\n73.83\nJanuary 2015\nStructured repurchases\n4,263\n$\n118.00\n10,428\n$\n97.16\n4,849\n$\n79.76\nJanuary 2017\nStructured repurchases\n3,923\n$\n151.80\n-\n$\n-\n-\n$\n-\nTotal shares\n8,186\n$\n134.20\n10,428\n$\n97.16\n8,104\n$\n77.38\nTotal cost\n$1,098,595\n$1,013,131\n$627,082\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nStock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions.

Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. At December 1, 2017, our maximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $350.6 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.\nCovenants\nOur credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of December 1, 2017, we were in compliance with this covenant. We believe this covenant will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants.\nUnder the terms of our credit agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nSee Results of Operations - Provision for Income Taxes above for our discussion on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.\nRoyalties\nWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit sold, or a percentage of the underlying revenue.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the directors or officers lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions, except Japanese Yen):\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nEuro\n\u20ac\n1,044.7\n\u20ac\n825.6\n\u20ac\n589.6\nJapanese Yen (in billions)\n\u00a5\n51.0\n\u00a5\n38.7\n\u00a5\n29.7\nBritish Pounds\n\u00a3\n338.4\n\u00a3\n263.5\n\u00a3\nAs of December 1, 2017, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $1.24 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $618.4 million in Euros, $225.3 million in British Pounds, $244.5 million in Japanese Yen and $148.9 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 1, 2017, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2018. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements that have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 1, 2017. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $79.7 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $23.6 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.\nWe also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $190.5 million and $70.2 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedging-Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nWe record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended December 1, 2017, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\nBalance Sheet Hedging-Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because\ngains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At December 1, 2017, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nSee Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\nAt December 1, 2017, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.51 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):\nDue within one year\n$\n1,023.7\nDue between one and two years\n1,289.3\nDue between two and three years\n812.8\nDue after three years\n387.9\nTotal\n$\n3,513.7\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 1, 2017. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.\nThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 (dollars in millions):\n-150 BPS\n-100 BPS\n-50 BPS\nFair Value 12/1/17\n+50 BPS\n+100 BPS\n+150 BPS\n$\n3,595.2\n$\n3,568.1\n$\n3,540.9\n$\n3,513.7\n$\n3,486.5\n$\n3,459.3\n$\n3,432.1\n-150 BPS\n-100 BPS\n-50 BPS\nFair Value 12/2/16\n+50 BPS\n+100 BPS\n+150 BPS\n$\n3,828.5\n$\n3,805.9\n$\n3,778.4\n$\n3,750.0\n$\n3,721.6\n$\n3,693.2\n$\n3,664.8\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 1, 2017, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nAs of December 1, 2017, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.88 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.98 billion.\nOther Market Risk\nPrivately Held Long-Term Investments\nThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have immaterial exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016. ITEM 8.

SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOperations\nFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators (SIs), independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase commitments, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and investments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal 2016 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2016 was a 53-week fiscal year compared with fiscal 2017 and 2015 which were 52-week fiscal years.\nReclassifications\nCertain immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the subscription, non-software related hosted services, term-based and perpetual licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training, and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements are complex, involving multiple solutions and various license rights, bundled with post-contract customer support and other meaningful rights that together provide a complete end-to-end solution to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDetermining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (BESP), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nSubscription and Services and Support Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training, and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.\nOur consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable.\nOur maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the arrangement.\nOur software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, hosted services, and online storage, are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.\nProduct Revenue\nWe recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.\nWe recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.\nOur product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified free upgrade expires.\nRights of Return, Rebates and Price Protection\nAs discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:\nDistributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being replaced by new versions.\nWe offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using historical trends.\nFrom time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior to the effective date of the decrease.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAlthough our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors.\nRevenue Reserve\nRevenue reserve rollforward (in thousands):\nBeginning balance\n$\n23,096\n$\n19,446\n$\n17,402\nAmount charged to revenue\n61,031\n55,739\n45,676\nActual returns\n(62,121\n)\n(52,089\n)\n(43,632\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n22,006\n$\n23,096\n$\n19,446\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings and payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and solutions described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n6,214\n$\n7,293\n$\n7,867\nIncrease due to acquisition\n2,391\nCharged to operating expenses\n4,411\n1,337\n1,472\nDeductions(1)\n(3,865\n)\n(2,493\n)\n(2,372\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n9,151\n$\n6,214\n$\n7,293\n________________________________________\n(1)\nDeductions related to the allowance for doubtful accounts represent amounts written off against the allowance, less recoveries.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, 5 to 20 years for building improvements and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nGoodwill, Purchased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We review our goodwill for impairment annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year. In performing our goodwill impairment test, we first evaluate goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the occurrence of an event or change in circumstances has reduced the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying value. The qualitative assessment requires that we consider events or circumstances that may include macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel, changes in strategy, changes in customers, changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting segments net assets, and changes in our stock price. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting segments are greater than the carrying amounts, then the two-step goodwill impairment test is not performed.\nIf the qualitative assessment indicates that the two-step quantitative analysis should be performed, we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We determined, after performing a qualitative review of each reporting segment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segments substantially exceeds the respective carrying amounts. Accordingly, there was no indication of impairment, and the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test was not performed.\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nDuring fiscal 2017, our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:\nWeighted Average\nUseful Life (years)\nPurchased technology\nCustomer contracts and relationships\nTrademarks\nAcquired rights to use technology\nLocalization\nOther intangibles\nInternal Use Software\nWe capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development of the applications. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nTaxes Collected from Customers\nWe net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. Accordingly, taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.\nTreasury Stock\nWe account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $141.7 million, $135.8 million and $113.6 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign Currency and Other Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign exchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.\nGains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted transactions occur.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these investments.\nWe enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.\nThe aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 was $14.2 million and $38.1 million respectively. These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties.\nCredit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and require letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments from their customers. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customers ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to recognizing the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nOn March 30, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies various aspects related to the accounting and presentation of share-based payments. The amendments require entities to record all tax effects related to share-based payments at settlement or expiration through the income statement and the windfall tax benefit to be recorded when it arises, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations. Tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments are required to be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. The updates relating to the income tax effects of the share-based payments including the cash flow presentation must be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. Further, the amendments allow the entities to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures or recognize forfeitures as they occur. If an election is made, the change to recognize forfeitures as they occur must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.\nWe early adopted this standard during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As required by the standard, excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense were reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of the provision for income taxes rather than paid-in capital on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we recorded excess tax benefits within our provision for income taxes, rather than additional paid-in capital upon adoption. The cumulative effect to retained earnings from previously unrecognized excess tax benefits, after offset by the related valuation allowance, was not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe also elected to prospectively apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefits wherein excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense were classified as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for fiscal 2017. Prior period classification of cash flows related to excess tax benefits were not adjusted in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Presentation requirements for cash flows related to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to all periods presented as such cash flows have historically been presented as financing activities. Further, we did not elect an accounting policy change to record forfeitures as they occur and thus we continue to estimate forfeitures at each period.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThere have been no other new accounting pronouncements made effective during fiscal 2017 that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect to adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nWhile we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe that the most significant impact relates to our accounting for arrangements that include on-premise term-based software licenses bundled with maintenance and support. Under current GAAP, the revenue attributable to these software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because VSOE does not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element as it is not sold separately. The requirement to have VSOE for undelivered elements to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software licenses is eliminated under the new standard. Accordingly, under the new standard we will be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software licenses. We expect revenue related to our professional services and cloud offerings, including Creative Cloud and Document Cloud for business enterprises, individuals and teams, to remain substantially unchanged. When sold with cloud-enabled services, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct. Revenue for these offerings will continue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Under current GAAP, we expense costs related to the acquisition of revenue-generating contracts as incurred. Under the new standard, we will be required to capitalize certain costs incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected period of benefit. Due to the complexity of certain of our contracts, the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and therefore may vary in some instances.\nOn February 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, requiring lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with the exception of short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. For lessees, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model. Lessors will continue to classify leases as operating, direct financing or sales-type leases. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we do not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nOn August 28, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging, requiring expanded hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and refining the measurement of hedge results to better reflect an entity's hedging strategies. The updated standard also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements and changes how entities assess hedge effectiveness. The effective date of the new standard for public companies is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings as of the initial adoption date. The updated standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and we do not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nWith the exception of the new standards discussed above, there have been no other new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\nTubeMogul\nOn December 19, 2016, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a publicly held video advertising platform company. As of the end of fiscal 2017, we are continuing to integrate TubeMogul into our Digital Marketing reportable segment.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to TubeMoguls net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 19, 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to managements estimates and assumptions in regards to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and their related impact to goodwill. The total final purchase price for TubeMogul was $560.8 million of which $348.4 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $113.1 million to identifiable intangible assets and $99.3 million to net assets acquired.\nFotolia\nOn January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to managements estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed.\nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.\nNOTE 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\nCash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as available-for-sale. In general, these investments are free of trading restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income.

Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2017 and 2015, we did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During fiscal 2016, we recorded immaterial other-than-temporary impairment losses associated with certain of our fixed income securities and wrote down the securities to fair value.\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. There have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the year ended December 1, 2017.\nThe fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at December 1, 2017 was determined using the following inputs (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds\n$\n2,006,741\n$\n2,006,741\n$\n-\n$\n-\nTime deposits\n18,843\n18,843\n-\n-\nShort-term investments:\nAsset-backed securities\n98,001\n-\n98,001\n-\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n2,454,260\n-\n2,454,260\n-\nForeign government securities\n2,388\n-\n2,388\n-\nMunicipal securities\n21,065\n-\n21,065\n-\nU.S. Treasury securities\n937,988\n-\n937,988\n-\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivatives\n14,198\n-\n14,198\n-\nOther assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets\n56,690\n2,573\n54,117\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n5,610,174\n$\n2,028,157\n$\n3,582,017\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses:\nForeign currency derivatives\n$\n1,598\n$\n-\n$\n1,598\n$\n-\nOther liabilities:\nInterest rate swap derivatives\n1,058\n-\n1,058\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n2,656\n$\n-\n$\n2,656\n$\n-\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at December 2, 2016 was determined using the following inputs (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n$\n1,249\n$\n-\n$\n1,249\n$\n-\nMoney market mutual funds\n782,210\n782,210\n-\n-\nMunicipal securities\n1,301\n-\n1,301\n-\nTime deposits\n17,920\n17,920\n-\n-\nShort-term investments:\nAsset-backed securities\n110,914\n-\n110,914\n-\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n2,458,350\n-\n2,458,350\n-\nMunicipal securities\n134,222\n-\n134,222\n-\nU.S. agency securities\n39,580\n-\n39,580\n-\nU.S. Treasury securities\n1,006,919\n-\n1,006,919\n-\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivatives\n38,112\n-\n38,112\n-\nOther assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets\n42,180\n1,831\n40,349\n-\nInterest rate swap derivatives\n13,117\n-\n13,117\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n4,646,074\n$\n801,961\n$\n3,844,113\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses:\nForeign currency derivatives\n$\n5,246\n$\n-\n$\n5,246\n$\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n5,246\n$\n-\n$\n5,246\n$\n-\nSee Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nOur fixed income available-for-sale debt securities consist of high quality, investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from independent pricing vendors who use matrix pricing valuation techniques including market approach methodologies that model information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, as well as discounted cash flow methodologies. Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly in determining fair value, including benchmark yields, issuer spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. We therefore classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2. We perform routine procedures such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe fair values of our money market mutual funds and time deposits are based on the closing price of these assets as of the reporting date. We classify our money market mutual funds and time deposits as Level 1.\nOur Level 2 over-the-counter foreign currency and interest rate swap derivatives are valued using pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies based on observable foreign exchange and interest rate data at the measurement date.\nOur deferred compensation plan assets consist of money market mutual funds and other mutual funds.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost and equity method, which are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, we write down the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost and equity method investments considering available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2017 and 2015, we determined there were no other-than-temporary impairments on our cost and equity method investments. During fiscal 2016, we determined there were immaterial other-than-temporary impairments on certain of our cost method investments and wrote down the investments to fair value.\nThe fair value of our senior notes was $1.98 billion as of December 1, 2017, based on observable market prices in less active markets and categorized as Level 2. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.\nNOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nHedge Accounting and Hedging Programs\nWe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively, and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions.\nBalance Sheet Hedging-Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nWe also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged.\nAs of December 1, 2017, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $333.9 million which included the notional equivalent of $105.0 million in Euros, $34.6 million in British Pounds, $45.4 million in Japanese Yen, $78.0 million in Indian Rupees, and $70.9 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 2, 2016, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $313.8 million which included the notional equivalent of $152.8 million in Euros, $33.6 million in British Pounds, $46.5\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nmillion in Japanese Yen, $26.4 million in Indian Rupees, and $54.5 million in other foreign currencies. At December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nCash Flow Hedging-Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor fiscal 2017 and 2016, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. In fiscal 2015, these net gains or losses were immaterial.\nFair Value Hedging-Hedges of Interest Rate Risks\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our $900 million of 4.75% fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). In effect, the interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 15 for further details regarding our debt.\nThe interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other liabilities or other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nFair Value\nAsset\nDerivatives\nFair Value\nLiability\nDerivatives\nFair Value\nAsset\nDerivatives\nFair Value\nLiability\nDerivatives\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange option contracts (1)(2)\n$\n12,918\n$\n-\n$\n34,355\n$\n-\nInterest rate swap (3)\n-\n1,058\n13,117\n-\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forward contracts (1)\n1,280\n1,598\n3,757\n5,246\nTotal derivatives\n$\n14,198\n$\n2,656\n$\n51,229\n$\n5,246\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nIncluded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses for asset derivatives and liability derivatives, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nHedging effectiveness expected to be recognized to income within the next twelve months.\n(3)\nIncluded in other liabilities and other assets in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe effect of foreign currency derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges and of foreign currency derivative instruments not designated as hedges in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\nForeign\nExchange\nOption\nContracts\nForeign\nExchange\nForward\nContracts\nForeign\nExchange\nOption\nContracts\nForeign\nExchange\nForward\nContracts\nForeign\nExchange\nOption\nContracts\nForeign\nExchange\nForward\nContracts\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nNet gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax(1)\n$\n6,917\n$\n-\n$\n36,511\n$\n-\n$\n39,825\n$\n-\nNet gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated\nother comprehensive income into income, net of tax(2)\n$\n32,852\n$\n-\n$\n18,823\n$\n-\n$\n56,336\n$\n-\nNet gain (loss) recognized in income(3)\n$\n(30,243\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(29,169\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(17,423\n)\n$\n-\nDerivatives not designated as hedging relationships:\nNet gain (loss) recognized in income(4)\n$\n-\n$\n6,586\n$\n-\n$\n(1,308\n)\n$\n-\n$\n4,430\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nNet change in the fair value of the effective portion classified in other comprehensive income (OCI).\n(2)\nEffective portion classified as revenue.\n(3)\nIneffective portion and amount excluded from effectiveness testing classified in interest and other income (expense), net.\n(4)\nClassified in interest and other income (expense), net.\nNet gains (losses) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net relating to balance sheet hedging for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\nGain (loss) on foreign currency assets and liabilities:\nNet realized gain (loss) recognized in other income\n$\n(6,142\n)\n$\n$\n(10,952\n)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) recognized in other income\n(907\n)\n(6,070\n)\n3,815\n(7,049\n)\n(5,238\n)\n(7,137\n)\nGain (loss) on hedges of foreign currency assets and liabilities:\nNet realized gain recognized in other income\n5,415\n5,490\nNet unrealized gain (loss) recognized in other income\n1,171\n(1,482\n)\n(1,060\n)\n6,586\n(1,308\n)\n4,430\nNet gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net\n$\n(463\n)\n$\n(6,546\n)\n$\n(2,707\n)\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 6.

Included in the deferred tax assets and liabilities for fiscal 2017 and 2016 are amounts related to various acquisitions. The deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of December 1, 2017, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $5.0 billion. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $1.4 billion.\nAs of December 1, 2017, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $118.4 million for federal and $52.6 million for state. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $166.2 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2018 through 2036. The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits are reduced by the valuation allowance and are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the carrying amount of which are expected to be fully realized.\nAs of December 1, 2017, a valuation allowance of $93.6 million has been established for certain deferred tax assets related to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2017, the total change in the valuation allowance was $69.3 million, of which $55.3 million was related to the deferred tax attributes recorded due to our early adoption of the new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nDuring fiscal 2017 and 2016, our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nBeginning balance\n$\n178,413\n$\n258,718\nGross increases in unrecognized tax benefits - prior year tax positions\n3,680\n6,047\nGross decreases in unrecognized tax benefits - prior year tax positions\n(30,166\n)\n(67,870\n)\nGross increases in unrecognized tax benefits - current year tax positions\n24,927\n23,068\nSettlements with taxing authorities\n(3,876\n)\n(33,265\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(8,819\n)\n(8,456\n)\nForeign exchange gains and losses\n8,786\nEnding balance\n$\n172,945\n$\n178,413\nThe combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns were approximately $23.6 million and $22.4 million for fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts were included in non-current income taxes payable in their respective years.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008, 2010 and 2013, respectively. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance of current and non-current assets, liabilities and income taxes payable. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $40 million.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted and included broad tax reforms that are applicable to Adobe. Under the provisions of the Act, the U.S. corporate tax rate decreased from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, our undistributed foreign earnings are subject to taxation in fiscal 2018 and are available for repatriation, and our future foreign earnings are subject to U.S. taxation. These changes will require us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities and reclassify deferred tax liabilities related to undistributed foreign earnings to long-term income taxes payable due over eight years.\nNOTE 10. BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\nIn 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2017, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employees eligible compensation. We contributed $34.3 million, $33.4 million and $25.7 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We are under no obligation to continue matching future employee contributions and, at our discretion, may change our practices at any time.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nOn September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, effective December 2, 2006 (the Deferred Compensation Plan). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which election is made. For cash benefit elections, distributions are made in cash and in the form of a lump sum or annual installments over five years. For stock benefit elections, distributions are settled in stock and in the form of a lump sum payment only.\nAs of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $56.7 million and $42.2 million, respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, $67.2 million and $49.0 million, respectively, was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.\nNOTE 11. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-based compensation plans and programs:\nRestricted Stock Unit Plan\nWe grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (2003 Plan). Restricted stock units granted as part of our annual review process or for promotions vest annually over three years. Restricted stock units granted to new hires generally vest over four years. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board of Directors or an authorized committee.\nWe grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan which cliff-vest after three years.\nAs of December 1, 2017, we had reserved 183.2 million shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and had 93.6 million shares available for grant.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The ESPP will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued.\nAs of December 1, 2017, we had reserved 93.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and approximately 7.0 million shares remain available for future issuance.\nStock Option Plan\nThe 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods used in the past were generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant.\nWe eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors effective fiscal 2014, but may choose to issue stock options in the future.\nPerformance Share Programs\nOur 2017, 2016 and 2015 Performance Share Programs aim to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. The Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approves the terms of each of our Performance Share Programs, including the award calculation methodology, under the terms of our 2003 Plan. Shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest upon the later of the Executive Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement or the three-year anniversary of each grant. Program participants generally have the ability to receive up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted.\nOn January 24, 2017, the Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2017 Performance Share Program, the terms of which are similar to prior year performance share programs as discussed above. As of December 1, 2017, the shares awarded under our 2017, 2016 and 2015 Performance Share Programs are yet to be achieved.\nIssuance of Shares\nUpon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the ESPP, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units and performance shares, we instituted a stock repurchase program. See Note 12 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.\nOur performance share awards are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards are fixed at grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe expected term of ESPP shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period. The assumptions used to value employee stock purchase rights were as follows:\nExpected life (in years)\n0.5 - 2.0\n0.5 - 2.0\n0.5 - 2.0\nVolatility\n22% - 27%\n26% - 29%\n26% - 30%\nRisk free interest rate\n0.62% - 1.41%\n0.37% - 1.06%\n0.11% - 0.67%\nSummary of Restricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock unit activity for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was as follows (in thousands):\nBeginning outstanding balance\n8,316\n10,069\n13,564\nAwarded\n5,018\n4,440\n4,012\nReleased\n(3,859\n)\n(5,471\n)\n(6,561\n)\nForfeited\n(766\n)\n(722\n)\n(946\n)\nIncrease due to acquisition\n-\n-\nEnding outstanding balance\n9,304\n8,316\n10,069\nThe weighted average grant date fair values of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $120.33, $89.87 and $75.47, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $472.0 million, $499.8 million and $495.1 million, respectively.\nInformation regarding restricted stock units outstanding at December 1, 2017, December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 is summarized below:\nNumber of\nShares\n(thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife\n(years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue(*)\n(millions)\nRestricted stock units outstanding\n9,304\n1.11\n$\n1,670.2\nRestricted stock units vested and expected to vest\n8,608\n1.05\n$\n1,545.3\nRestricted stock units outstanding\n8,316\n1.11\n$\n829.4\nRestricted stock units vested and expected to vest\n7,613\n1.04\n$\n759.3\nRestricted stock units outstanding\n10,069\n0.93\n$\n928.0\nRestricted stock units vested and expected to vest\n9,267\n0.86\n$\n842.9\n_________________________________________\n(*)\nThe intrinsic value is calculated as the market value as of the end of the fiscal period.

Actual performance resulted in participants achieving 198% of target or approximately 0.6 million additional shares. The shares granted and achieved under the 2014 Performance Share Program fully vested on the three-year anniversary of the grant on January 24, 2017, if not forfeited.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2016, the Executive Compensation Committee certified the actual performance achievement of participants in the 2013 Performance Share Program. Actual performance resulted in participants achieving 198% of target or approximately 0.7 million additional shares. The shares granted and achieved under the 2013 Performance Share Program fully vested on the three-year anniversary of the grant on January 24, 2016, if not forfeited.

Employees purchased 1.9 million shares at an average price of $77.63, 1.9 million shares at an average price of $66.13, and 2.1 million shares at an average price of $52.37, respectively, for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. The intrinsic value of shares purchased during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $97.7 million, $54.3 million and $53.9 million, respectively. The intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the market value on the date of purchase and the purchase price of the shares.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSummary of Stock Options\nAs of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, we had 0.3 million and 0.6 million stock options outstanding, respectively.\nGrants to Executive Officers\nAll equity awards granted to executive officers are made after a review by and with the approval of the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nGrants to Non-Employee Directors\nAlthough the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units to non-employee directors, restricted stock units are the primary form of our grants to non-employee directors since fiscal 2014. The initial equity grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100% on the day preceding the next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled.\nAnnual equity grants to non-employee directors in the form of restricted stock units shall have an aggregate value of $0.3 million as based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100% on the day preceding the next annual meeting.\nRestricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\nRestricted stock units granted to existing directors\nCompensation Costs\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. The fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 awards are earned upon achievement of an objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance period, as described above.\nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nAs of December 1, 2017, there was $708.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nTotal stock-based compensation costs that have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands):\nIncome Statement Classifications\nCost of\nRevenue-\nSubscription\nCost of\nRevenue-\nServices and Support\nResearch and Development\nSales and\nMarketing\nGeneral and Administrative\nTotal(1)\nOption Grants and Stock\nPurchase Rights\n$\n$\n6,661\n$\n20,126\n$\n18,592\n$\n4,973\n$\n50,532\n$\n1,474\n$\n5,514\n$\n13,932\n$\n16,534\n$\n4,371\n$\n41,825\n$\n1,449\n$\n5,185\n$\n14,082\n$\n18,360\n$\n4,790\n$\n43,866\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance\nShare Awards\n$\n16,792\n$\n9,602\n$\n161,366\n$\n139,047\n$\n77,133\n$\n403,940\n$\n6,632\n$\n7,522\n$\n109,249\n$\n113,757\n$\n70,312\n$\n307,472\n$\n6,481\n$\n6,446\n$\n104,624\n$\n109,908\n$\n66,709\n$\n294,168\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded tax benefits of $153.2 million, $71.7 million and $68.8 million, respectively.\nNOTE 12.

In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us authority to repurchase up to $2.5 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2019. The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous stock repurchase programs.\nDuring fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $1.10 billion, $1.08 billion, and $625 million, respectively. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the expected foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nThe financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares at an average price per share of $134.20 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased approximately 10.4 million shares at an average price per share of $97.16 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price per share of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014.\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by December 1, 2017, December 2, 2016 and November 27, 2015 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of December 1, 2017, $101.5 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, as part of the 2017 stock repurchase authority, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $300 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $300 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.6 billion remains under our current authority.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 13. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance awards. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, performance share awards, and stock options using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share data):\nNet income\n$\n1,693,954\n$\n1,168,782\n$\n629,551\nShares used to compute basic net income per share\n493,632\n498,345\n498,764\nDilutive potential common shares:\nUnvested restricted stock units and performance share awards\n7,161\n5,455\n7,389\nStock options\n1,011\nShares used to compute diluted net income per share\n501,123\n504,299\n507,164\nBasic net income per share\n$\n3.43\n$\n2.35\n$\n1.26\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n3.38\n$\n2.32\n$\n1.24\nFor fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of our stock of $138.71, $96.39, and $79.22, respectively, that would have been anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLease Commitments\nWe lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2031. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $115.4 million in fiscal 2017 and $92.9 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented.\nWe occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden, East and West Towers.\nIn March 2017, we exercised our option to purchase the Almaden Tower for a total purchase price of $103.6 million. Upon purchase, our investment in the lease receivable of $80.4 million was credited against the total purchase price. We capitalized the Almaden Tower as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $104.2 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase.\nAs of December 1, 2017, we own the buildings and the underlying land that make up our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, including the Almaden Tower.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of December 1, 2017 (in thousands):\nOperating Leases\nFiscal Year\nPurchase\nObligations\nFuture\nMinimum\nLease\nPayments\nFuture\nMinimum\nSublease\nIncome\n$\n449,823\n$\n60,464\n$\n3,001\n245,087\n62,307\n2,903\n63,341\n2,286\n-\n53,670\n2,036\n-\n44,016\n-\nThereafter\n-\n251,544\n-\nTotal\n$\n695,320\n$\n535,342\n$\n10,226\nOther\nSubsequent to December 1, 2017, we purchased land near our headquarters in San Jose, California for a total purchase price of $68.0 million.\nRoyalties\nWe have royalty commitments associated with the licensing of certain offerings and products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $100.9 million, $79.8 million and $62.3 million in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officers or directors lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nor services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\nIn connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.\nNOTE 15. DEBT\nOur long-term debt as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nNotes\n$\n1,882,479\n$\n1,879,083\nFair value of interest rate swap\n(1,058\n)\n13,117\nAdjusted carrying value of Notes\n1,881,421\n1,892,200\nSenior Notes\nIn February 2010, we issued $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). Our proceeds were $900 million and were net of an issuance discount of $5.5 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $6.4 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 4.92% . Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010.\nIn June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. Under the terms of the swap, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR interest rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nIn January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67%. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2015. A portion of the proceeds from this offering was used to repay $600 million in aggregate principal amount of previously outstanding senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due February 1, 2015. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 1, 2017, our outstanding notes payable consist of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the Notes) with a total carrying value of $1.88 billion, which includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps and is net of debt issuance costs. Based on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.98 billion as of December 1, 2017, which excludes the effect of the fair value of the interest rate swaps described above.\nWe may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of December 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants.\nIn February and August 2017, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes each totaling $37.6 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, request up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our public debt ratings, ranging from 0.795% and 1.3% or (ii) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the agents prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.00% to 0.30%. Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.08% and 0.20% per year, also based on our debt ratings. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio.\nOn March 1, 2013, we exercised an option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement.\nThe facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.\nAs of December 1, 2017, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 16.

INDUSTRY SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS\nWe report segment information based on the management approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.\nOur CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.\nFor fiscal 2017, we have the following reportable segments:\nDigital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

We also have audited Adobe Systems Incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Adobe Systems Incorporateds management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 1, 2017 and December 2, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 1, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Adobe Systems Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nAdobe Systems Incorporated acquired TubeMogul, Inc. (TubeMogul) on December 19, 2016, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of Adobe System Incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017, TubeMoguls internal control over financial reporting associated with consolidated total assets of approximately 1.8% and consolidated total revenues of approximately 2.5%, included in the consolidated financial statements of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 1, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Adobe Systems Incorporated as of December 1, 2017, also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of TubeMogul.\n(signed) KPMG LLP\nSanta Clara, California\nJanuary 22, 2018 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 1, 2017. Based on their evaluation as of December 1, 2017, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 1, 2017. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Our management has concluded that, as of December 1, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.\nWe acquired TubeMogul, Inc. (TubeMogul) on December 19, 2016, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As permitted by the SEC staffs Frequently Asked Question 3 on Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and Certification of Disclosure in Exchange Act Periodic Reports (revised September 24, 2007), our management excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting effectiveness as of December 1, 2017, TubeMoguls internal control over financial reporting associated with consolidated total assets of approximately 1.8% and consolidated total revenues of approximately 2.5%, included in our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 1, 2017. We will include TubeMogul in our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting starting fiscal 2018.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 1, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.\n(b)\nOn January 22, 2018, Mark Garrett notified Adobe Systems Incorporated (Adobe) of his intent to retire as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Adobe during 2018. Mike Dillon also notified Adobe of his intent to retire as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Adobe during 2018.
