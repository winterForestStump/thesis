ORGANIZATION\nOrganization. MGM Resorts International, a Delaware corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, the Company) is a global gaming and entertainment company with domestic and international locations featuring hotels and casinos, convention, dining, and retail offerings, and sports betting and online gaming operations.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Companys domestic casino resorts include the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Aria (including Vdara), Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (The Cosmopolitan), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, and Excalibur. The Company also operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, MGM National Harbor in Prince Georges County, Maryland, MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Empire City in Yonkers, New York, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio, and Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi. Additionally, the Company operates The Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM. The Company leases the real estate assets of its domestic properties pursuant to triple-net lease agreements, as further discussed in Note 8.\nThe Company has an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, MGM China), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (MGM Grand Paradise). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming concession and land concessions.\nThe Company also owns LeoVegas AB (LeoVegas), a consolidated subsidiary that has global online gaming operations headquartered in Sweden and Malta. Additionally, the Company and its venture partner, Entain plc, each have a 50% ownership interest in BetMGM, LLC (BetMGM), an unconsolidated affiliate, which provides online sports betting and gaming in certain jurisdictions in North America.\nJapan. In April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka and the Companys 50% owned unconsolidated venture.\nMGM Grand Paradise gaming concession. Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to six different concessionaires. On December 16, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise was awarded a ten-year concession contract to permit the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, which commenced on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 5 for further discussion of the gaming concession.\nReportable segments. The Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 12 for additional information about the Companys segments.\nImpact of COVID-19 - Update. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and on February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of June 30, 2023, all of the Companys properties were open and not subject to any COVID-19 related operating restrictions.\nNOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys 2022 annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Companys interim financial statements. The results for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\nPrinciples of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entitys equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.\nThe Company has a 5% ownership interest in the venture that owns and leases back the real estate assets of Bellagio (the Bellagio BREIT Venture). Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The Companys maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $55 million as of June 30, 2023, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Companys guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of June 30, 2023, as further discussed in Note 9.\nFor entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest based upon the terms of the respective entities ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company generally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810. For entities over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.\nFair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Companys accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Companys accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are quoted prices for identical or comparable instruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:\nLevel 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;\nLevel 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures; See Note 6; and\nLevel 1 and Level 2 inputs for its debt investments.\nEquity investments. Fair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value. The fair value of these investments was $466 million and $461 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is reflected within Other long-term assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are recorded in Other, net in the statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net gain on its equity investments of $6 million and $5 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss on its equity investments of $23 million and $8 million, respectively.\nDebt investments. The Companys investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Gains and losses are recorded in Other, net in the statements of operations. Debt securities are considered cash equivalents if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise classified as short-term investments within Prepaid expenses and other since the investment of cash is available for current operations.\nThe following tables present information regarding the Companys debt investments:\nFair value level June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nMoney market funds Level 1 $ 2,195 $ 12,009\nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit Level 2 - 5,992\nCash and cash equivalents 2,195 18,001\nShort-term investments:\nU.S. government securities Level 1 57,696 56,835\nU.S. agency securities Level 2 29,049 9,530\nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit Level 2 4,561 4,466\nCorporate bonds Level 2 416,420 213,875\nShort-term investments 507,726 284,706\nTotal debt investments $ 509,921 $ 302,707\nRestricted cash. MGM Chinas pledged cash of $87 million and $124 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, securing the bank guarantees discussed in Note 9 is restricted in use and classified within Other long-term assets, net. Such amounts plus Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets equal Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nAccounts receivable. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the loss reserve on accounts receivable was $129 million and $113 million, respectively.\nNote receivable. In February 2023, the secured note receivable related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and the adjacent land was repaid, prior to maturity, for $170 million, which approximated its carrying value on the date of repayment. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of the note receivable was $167 million and was recorded within Other long-term assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounts payable. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had accrued $60 million and $80 million, respectively, for purchases of property and equipment within Accounts and construction payable on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRevenue recognition. Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (casino front money) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided, such as advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within Other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:\nOutstanding Chip Liability Loyalty Program Customer Advances and Other\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nBalance at January 1 $ 185,669 $ 176,219 $ 183,602 $ 144,465 $ 816,376 $ 640,001\nBalance at June 30 196,446 165,564 194,570 160,752 806,072 704,404\nIncrease / (decrease) $ 10,777 $ (10,655) $ 10,968 $ 16,287 $ (10,304) $ 64,403\nThe January 1, 2023 balances exclude liabilities related to assets held for sale.\nRevenue by source. The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 12.\nLeases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.\nThe Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement, the right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Companys triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Companys leases, such as its ground subleases and equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Companys triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Companys option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Companys leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement. Refer to Note 8 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee.\nThe Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenants good or service. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, lease revenues from third-party tenants include $19 million and $37 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $29 million and $59 million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, lease revenues from third-party tenants include $19 million and $33 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $29 million and $55 million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues within the consolidated statements of operations.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest. Certain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. The noncontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.\nThe Company has recorded the interests as Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not stockholders equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Companys control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjusted for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, MGM National Harbor purchased $138 million and $21 million of interests from the noncontrolling interest parties, respectively.\nShare repurchases. Shares repurchased pursuant to the Companys share repurchase plans are retired upon purchase. The cost of the repurchases in excess of the aggregate par value of the shares reduces capital in excess of par value, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied against retained earnings.\nNOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nLeoVegas acquisition. On May 2, 2022, the Company commenced a public offer to the shareholders of LeoVegas to tender 100% of the shares at a price of SEK 61 in cash per share. On September 7, 2022, the Company completed its tender offer and acquired 65% of the outstanding shares of LeoVegas and, at the completion of an extended acceptance period on September 22, 2022, acquired an additional 2% of outstanding shares, for an aggregate cash tender price of $370 million. During the tender offer period, the Company had acquired 31% of outstanding shares in open market purchases that had an acquisition-date fair value of approximately $172 million. As the Companys previous 31% ownership interest was accounted for at fair value, no gain or loss was recorded upon consolidation. The remaining outstanding shares, with a fair value of approximately $11 million based upon the tender price, were settled by the Company in cash in connection with squeeze-out proceedings during the second quarter of 2023. The acquisition provides the Company an opportunity to create a scaled global online gaming business.\nThe Company recognized 100% of the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of LeoVegas at fair value at the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired equity interests of LeoVegas was determined by the tender price and equaled $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists and technology, which are finite-lived intangibles that are amortized over each of their estimated useful lives of five years. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of LeoVegas in excess of identifiable assets and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to Corporate and other.\nThe following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 93,407\nReceivables and other current assets 36,872\nTechnology 109,027\nTrademarks 144,374\nCustomer lists 126,526\nGoodwill 288,367\nOther long-term assets 19,181\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities (118,302)\nDebt (104,439)\nOther long-term liabilities (36,457)\nNoncontrolling interests (2,861)\n$ 555,695\nThe Cosmopolitan acquisition. On May 17, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in the entities that own the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. The acquisition expands the Companys customer base and provides a greater depth of choices and experiences for guests in Las Vegas.\nThe Company recognized 100% of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists, which is amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill, which is deductible for\ntax purposes, is primarily attributable to the profitability of The Cosmopolitan in excess of identifiable assets as well as expected synergies. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.\nThe following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 80,670\nReceivables and other current assets 94,354\nProperty and equipment 120,912\nTrademarks 130,000\nCustomer lists 95,000\nGoodwill 1,289,468\nOperating lease right-of-use-assets, net 3,404,894\nOther long-term assets 23,709\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities (145,136)\nOperating lease liabilities (3,401,815)\nOther long-term liabilities (1,570)\n$ 1,690,486\nUnaudited pro forma information - The Cosmopolitan acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the Company has been prepared assuming the Companys acquisition of The Cosmopolitan had occurred as of January 1, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of the indicated date. Pro forma results of operations for the LeoVegas acquisition have not been included because it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2022 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 3,422,277 $ 6,542,015\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International 1,781,930 1,780,076\nVICI Transaction. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction (defined below), MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP) was a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets were owned by and substantially all of its operations were conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (\"MGP OP). MGP had two classes of common shares: Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owned MGPs Class B share, through which it held a controlling interest in MGP as it was entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGPs shares. The Company and MGP each held MGP OP units representing limited partner interests in MGP OP.\nAdditionally, the Company had leased the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield from MGP OP. The Company also leased, and continues to lease, the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas from subsidiaries of a venture that was 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP at the time of the transaction (such venture, the MGP BREIT Venture).\nOn April 29, 2022, VICI Properties Inc. (VICI) acquired MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the VICI Transaction). MGP Class A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and the Company received 1.366 units of VICI OP in exchange for each MGP OP unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP redeemed the majority of the Companys VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with the Company retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP that had a fair value of approximately $375 million. MGPs Class B share that was held by the Company was cancelled. Accordingly, the Company no longer held a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions.\nFurther, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI as discussed in Note 8. The Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas lease remained unchanged.\nIn connection with the transactions, the Company recognized a $2.3 billion gain recorded within Gain on REIT transactions, net. The gain reflects the fair value of consideration received of $4.8 billion plus the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest immediately prior to the transactions of $3.2 billion less the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities and accumulated comprehensive income derecognized of $5.7 billion.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities derecognized were as follows:\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,387\nIncome tax receivable 5,486\nPrepaid expenses and other 128\nProperty and equipment, net 9,250,519\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 817,901\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 236,255\nOther long-term assets, net 3,991\nTotal assets $ 10,339,667\nAccounts payable $ 1,136\nAccrued interest on long-term debt 68,150\nOther accrued liabilities 4,057\nDeferred income taxes, net 1,284\nLong-term debt, net 4,259,473\nOperating lease liabilities 336,689\nTotal liabilities $ 4,670,789\nThe Mirage transaction. On December 19, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc. (Hard Rock) for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, or $1.1 billion, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent.\nGold Strike Tunica. On February 15, 2023, the Company completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE Gaming Holdings, LLC (CNE), a subsidiary of Cherokee Nation Business, for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and to reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. The Company recognized a $399 million gain recorded within Property transactions, net. The gain reflects the net cash consideration less the net carrying value of the assets and liabilities derecognized of $75 million.\nThe operations of Gold Strike Tunica are not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded that the sale is not a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Companys operations or its financial results and it does not represent a major geographic segment or product line.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities derecognized are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 26,911\nAccounts receivable, net 2,466\nInventories 1,087\nPrepaid expenses and other 1,522\nProperty and equipment, net 21,300\nGoodwill 40,523\nOther intangible assets, net 5,700\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 507,231\nOther long-term assets, net 1,251\nTotal assets $ 607,991\nAccounts payable $ 1,657\nOther accrued liabilities 13,778\nOther long-term obligations 1,707\nOperating lease liabilities 516,136\nTotal liabilities $ 533,278\nNOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates consisted of the following:\nJune 30,\n2023 December 31,\n(In thousands)\nBetMGM (50%)\n$ - $ 31,760\nOther 156,993 141,279\n$ 156,993 $ 173,039\nThe Companys share of losses of BetMGM in excess of its equity method investment balance is $21 million as of June 30, 2023.\nThe Company recorded its share of loss from unconsolidated affiliates as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nLoss from unconsolidated affiliates $ (16,189) $ (55,583) $ (91,188) $ (102,421)\nNon-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates (441) (6,120) (1,625) (21,253)\n$ (16,630) $ (61,703) $ (92,813) $ (123,674)\nThe following table summarizes information related to the Companys share of operating loss from unconsolidated affiliates:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nMGP BREIT Venture (through April 29, 2022) $ - $ 12,116 $ - $ 51,051\nBetMGM (22,499) (71,229) (104,372) (163,223)\nOther 6,310 3,530 13,184 9,751\n$ (16,189) $ (55,583) $ (91,188) $ (102,421)\nIn connection with the VICI Transaction in April 2022, the Company deconsolidated MGP and, accordingly, derecognized the assets and liabilities of MGP, which included MGP OPs investment in MGP BREIT Venture.\nMGP BREIT Venture distributions.

Pursuant to the gaming concession contract that MGM Grand Paradise entered into with the Macau government, which commenced January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise\nis required, among other things, to pay a fixed annual premium and an annual variable premium based on the number of gaming tables and machines for the term of the gaming concession. Additionally, in connection with the expiration of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession on December 31, 2022, the casino areas of MGM Cotai and MGM Macau reverted, free of charge and without any encumbrances, to the Macau government, which became the legal owner of the reverted gaming assets. Upon the commencement of the gaming concession, the gaming assets were temporarily transferred to MGM Grand Paradise for the duration of the concession term in return for annual payments determined by square meters of the reverted casino areas.\nOn January 1, 2023, MGM Grand Paradise recorded an intangible asset, included within Gaming rights above, of $226 million for the right to conduct gaming and operate the reverted gaming equipment and gaming areas and a corresponding liability for the in-substance consideration to be paid over the concession term for such rights, which is the unconditional obligation of the fixed and variable annual premiums, as well as the payments relating to the use of the reverted gaming assets. The initial value of the intangible asset and liability were measured as the present value of these payments based upon the approved number of gaming tables and slot machines, estimates of the Macau average price index, and square meters of the reverted casino areas, each as of January 1, 2023. The current portion of $7 million and noncurrent portion of $212 million of the remaining liability was recorded within Other accrued liabilities and Other long-term liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023. The gaming concession intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the ten-year term of the gaming concession contract. The fully amortized gaming subconcession intangible asset was derecognized upon the expiration of the gaming subconcession and corresponding commencement of the gaming concession contract.\nNOTE 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nJune 30,\n2023 December 31,\n(In thousands)\nMGM China first revolving credit facility $ 708,224 $ 1,249,744\nMGM China second revolving credit facility - 224,313\n6% senior notes, due 2023\n- 1,250,000\nLeoVegas senior notes, due 2023\n35,248 36,580\n5.375% MGM China senior notes, due 2024\n750,000 750,000\n6.75% senior notes, due 2025\n750,000 750,000\n5.75% senior notes, due 2025\n675,000 675,000\n5.25% MGM China senior notes, due 2025\n500,000 500,000\n5.875% MGM China senior notes, due 2026\n750,000 750,000\n4.625% senior notes, due 2026\n400,000 400,000\n5.5% senior notes, due 2027\n675,000 675,000\n4.75% MGM China senior notes, due 2027\n750,000 750,000\n4.75% senior notes, due 2028\n750,000 750,000\n7% debentures, due 2036\n552 552\n6,744,024 8,761,189\nLess: Premiums, discounts, and unamortized debt issuance costs, net (34,780) (41,899)\n6,709,244 8,719,290\nLess: Current portion (35,200) (1,286,473)\n$ 6,674,044 $ 7,432,817\nMGM China's senior notes due within one year of the June 30, 2023 balance sheet were classified as long-term as MGM China has both the intent and ability to refinance the current maturities on a long-term basis.\nSenior secured credit facility.

The public ownership of MGPs Class A shares was recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2022, the Company completed the VICI Transaction, which resulted in the deconsolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on the VICI Transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion on the master lease with VICI.\nItem 2.

MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as we, us or our. MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as MGM China. MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its subsidiaries is referred to as MGP.\nOverview of strategic business developments\nIn February 2023, we completed the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, or $474 million, net of purchase price adjustments and transaction costs. At closing, the master lease with VICI was amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. Refer to Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.\nIn April 2023, the Japanese government officially certified the Area Development Plan (ADP) previously submitted by the city/prefecture of Osaka, Japan and our 50% owned venture.\nIn April 2023, LeoVegas entered into an agreement to acquire the majority ownership of digital gaming developer, Push Gaming Holding Limited. The transaction is subject to regulatory and customary approvals and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.\nImpact of COVID-19 - Update\nOn January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19 pandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being required to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result, and on February 6, 2023 all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were removed. As of June 30, 2023, all of our properties were open and not subject to any COVID-19 related operating restrictions.\nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slot handle (volume indicators); win or hold percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-baccarat; and\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) - hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (ADR, a price indicator); and revenue per available room (RevPAR, a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.\nResults of Operations\nSummary Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 3,942,207 $ 3,264,888 $ 7,815,503 $ 6,119,197\nOperating income 371,378 2,381,451 1,102,217 2,487,239\nNet income 243,544 1,622,625 723,427 1,587,832\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International 200,796 1,783,937 667,603 1,765,921\nConsolidated net revenues increased 21% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter due primarily to a 418% increase at MGM China as a result of the removal of travel and entry restrictions in Macau, partially offset by a decrease at our Regional Operations of 3% due primarily to the disposition of Gold Strike Tunica. Net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts were flat.\nConsolidated operating income decreased 84% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year quarter.

The decrease from the prior year periods is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the repayment of the $1.0 billion 7.75% senior notes in March 2022, the derecognition of MGP OPs senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of MGP in April 2022, and the repayment of the $1.25 billion 6% senior notes in March 2023, and the decrease in the debt outstanding under MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.\nOther, net\nOther, net was income of $24 million and expense of $43 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change from the prior year quarter is primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $28 million and a change in the gain/loss on the fair value of equity instruments of $29 million. Other, net was income of $70 million and expense of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change from the prior year period is primarily due to an increase in interest and dividend income of $80 million.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 13.8% and 22.1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to 26.1% and 25.3% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The effective rate for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2023 was favorably impacted by an increase in Macau income that was offset by expiring net operating losses from prior years subject to valuation allowances. The effective rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 was driven primarily by tax expense recorded on the VICI Transaction and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance for Macau deferred tax assets and by losses in Macau from which we could not benefit, partially offset by the favorable impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transaction.\nReportable segment GAAP measure\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, property transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\nNon-GAAP measures\nSame-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period and to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of disposed operating segments from the beginning of the reporting period through the date of disposition. Accordingly, for Las Vegas Strip Resorts, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and of The Mirage for the periods prior to its disposition on December 19, 2022, as applicable. For Regional Operations, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of Gold Strike Tunica for the periods prior to its disposition on February 15, 2023, as applicable.\nSame-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.\nAdjusted EBITDAR is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Companys results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in\ncapital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MGM Resorts International to Adjusted EBITDAR:\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, Six Months Ended\nJune 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International $ 200,796 $ 1,783,937 $ 667,603 $ 1,765,921\nPlus: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 42,748 (161,312) 55,824 (178,089)\nNet income 243,544 1,622,625 723,427 1,587,832\nProvision for income taxes 39,141 572,839 204,920 536,498\nIncome before income taxes 282,685 2,195,464 928,347 2,124,330\nNon-operating (income) expense:\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized 111,945 136,559 242,245 332,650\nNon-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates 441 6,120 1,625 21,253\nOther, net (23,693) 43,308 (70,000) 9,006\n88,693 185,987 173,870 362,909\nOperating income 371,378 2,381,451 1,102,217 2,487,239\nPreopening and start-up expenses 149 542 288 976\nProperty transactions, net 5,614 (19,395) (390,462) 35,343\nDepreciation and amortization 203,503 366,255 407,004 654,893\nGain on REIT transactions, net - (2,277,747) - (2,277,747)\nTriple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense 564,158 483,454 1,134,713 745,906\nIncome from unconsolidated affiliates related to real estate ventures (2,695) (14,826) (5,390) (56,472)\nAdjusted EBITDAR $ 1,142,107 $ 2,248,370\nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of June 30, 2023, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that owns the operations of MGM Springfield), MGM Sports & Interactive Gaming, LLC (the entity that owns our 50% interest in BetMGM), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including LeoVegas, MGM China, and each of their respective subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.\nThe guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantors obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.\nThe summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale associated with Gold Strike Tunica are included within current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, within the summarized financial information as of December 31, 2022.\nJune 30,\n2023 December 31,\nBalance Sheet (In thousands)\nCurrent assets $ 4,561,993 $ 6,733,048\nIntercompany debts due from non-guarantor subsidiaries 144,016 -\nOther long-term assets 28,469,704 28,802,794\nOther current liabilities 1,966,713 3,892,694\nOther long-term liabilities 28,346,816 28,285,295\nSix Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nIncome Statement (In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 5,317,457\nOperating income 898,510\nIncome before income taxes 897,399\nNet income 691,194\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International 691,194\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $933 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above, a decrease in working capital primarily related to collection of receivables, and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and the change in cash paid (refunded) for taxes, net.\nInvesting activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.\nCash used in investing activities was $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2.2 billion in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received $447 million in net cash related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica, received $153 million in cash related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid, made payments of $393 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $50 million to BetMGM, and made $216 million in net investments in debt securities. In comparison, in the prior year period we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI\nTransaction, which were partially offset by net cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, payments of $237 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributed $150 million to BetMGM.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe made capital expenditures of $393 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $20 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and corporate and other entities of $373 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels.\nWe made capital expenditures of $237 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, of which $16 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $221 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $162 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $162 million, as further discussed below, distributed $206 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock.\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.25 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity and aggregate net repayments of $758 million on MGM Chinas revolving credit facilities.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $162 million, which consisted of the repayment of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, net draws of $40 million on MGP OPs revolving credit facility, and net borrowings of $798 million on MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility to fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes.\nDividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners, and Share Repurchases\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, we paid $1.1 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 11 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.1 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share in March and June 2022, totaling $2 million and MGP OP paid $283 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $117 million and MGP received $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.\nOn February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which MGM China held $448 million, and we had $6.7 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $708 million outstanding under MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or MGM Chinas second revolving credit facility. In June 2023, MGM China amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility, which extended the maturity date of each facility to May 2026, increased the amount to which MGM China may upsize its second revolving credit facility, removed the requirement for the MGM China first revolving credit facility to be fully drawn prior to utilizing the MGM China second revolving credit facility, and extended the financial covenant waivers through December 31, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2023, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $180 million to $190 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately $395 million to $405 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.\nWe are required, as of June 30, 2023, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 8 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.\nWe have planned capital expenditures expected over the remainder of 2023 of approximately $450 million to $460 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $50 million to $80 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects.\nWe continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing a commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. Additionally, we expect to have cash commitments of $80 million to $100 million over the remainder of 2023 relating to our Japan ventures planned integrated resort in Osaka for which the amount and timing is subject to change and will be dependent upon funding of the venture from noncontrolling interests and the timing and amount of financing received by the venture.\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $88 million, excluding excise tax. Repurchased shares were retired.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end.\nMarket Risk\nOur primary market exposures are to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity market trading prices.\nInterest rate risk. We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures.\nAs of June 30, 2023, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 11% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:\nDebt maturing in Fair Value June 30, 2023\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total\n(In millions)\nFixed-rate $ - $ 750 $ 1,925 $ 1,150 $ 1,425 $ 751 $ 6,001 $ 5,726\nAverage interest rate N/A 5.4 % 6.0 % 5.4 % 5.1 % 4.8 % 5.4 %\nVariable rate $ 35 $ - $ - $ 708 $ - $ - $ 743 $ 743\nAverage interest rate 9.2 % N/A N/A 7.8 % N/A N/A 7.9 %\nForeign currency risk. Our worldwide operations are conducted in multiple foreign currencies, which primarily are the Hong Kong dollar and Macau pataca, but we report our financial results in U.S. dollars. We manage the foreign currency risk through normal operating activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nMGM China holds U.S. dollar denominated debt, which may cause foreign currency transaction losses. The Macau pataca is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar and the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, however, the current peg rates may not remain at the same level and possible changes to the peg rates may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. As of June 30, 2023, a 1% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.\nWe hold forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. As of June 30, 2023, the notional amount of the forward contracts was $316 million with a fair value of ($14 million) and a 10% adverse change in the exchange rate would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of approximately $32 million.\nEquity price risk. We have investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies that are subject to equity price volatility. As of June 30, 2023, a 10% adverse change in the quoted market prices would result in an impact to earnings of $47 million.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects, will, may and similar references to future periods. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: statements we make regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, expectations regarding the impact of macroeconomic trends on our business, our ability to execute on ongoing and future strategic initiatives, including the development of an integrated resort in Japan, a commercial gaming facility in New York and investments we make in online sports betting and iGaming, the expansion of LeoVegas and the MGM digital brand, positioning BetMGM as a leader in sports betting and iGaming, the closing of the Push Gaming Holding Limited acquisition, amounts we will spend on capital expenditures and investments, our expectations with respect to future share repurchases and cash dividends on our common stock, dividends and distributions we will receive from MGM China, amounts projected to be realized as deferred tax assets, and our ability to achieve our public social impact and sustainability goals. The foregoing is not a complete list of all forward-looking statements we make.\nForward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, regional, national or global political, economic,
