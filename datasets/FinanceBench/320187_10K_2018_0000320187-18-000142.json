    "content": "ITEM 1. Business\nGeneral\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms we, us, NIKE and the Company refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at www.nike.com. On our NIKE corporate website, located at investors.nike.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings may also be obtained by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549, or by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 and are available on the SECs website (www.sec.gov). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad.\nProducts\nWe focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as American football, baseball, cricket, lacrosse, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities.\nNIKEs athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.\nWe also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\nOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\nOne of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nAnother of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, Hurley, headquartered in Costa Mesa, California, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results for Hurley products are included within the NIKE Brands North America geographic operating segment.\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.\nSales and Marketing\nFinancial information about geographic and segment operations appears in Note 17 - Operating Segments and Related Information of the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Analyst Reports\nCertain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to NIKEs business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by NIKE or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the SEC, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by NIKE with the SEC, including reports filed on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for NIKE products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for NIKE products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining NIKEs increasingly complex information technology systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of orders with shorter lead times, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of NIKE to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of NIKEs products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity, including without limitation, through social media or in connection with brand damaging events; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in NIKEs debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, inflation, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; the impact of recent U.S. tax reform legislation on our results of operations; the potential impact of new laws, regulations or policy, including, without limitation, tariffs, import/export, trade and immigration regulations or policies; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change and natural disasters; litigation, regulatory proceedings and other claims asserted against NIKE; the ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and any negative public perception with respect to key personnel; the effects of NIKEs decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.\nThe risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKEs business and financial performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKEs business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nInvestors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKEs policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.\nOur products face intense competition.\nNIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers selling our products.\nProduct offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition. This, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping, and the rising trend of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.\nFailure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.\nOur iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media, mobile applications and online advertising. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.\nTechnical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.\nFailure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.\nWe establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.\nFurthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or endorsers, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. In addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, or public figures, to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures, and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.\nGeneral economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.\nA majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdoms impending exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit and new or proposed U.S. policy changes. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Companys foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\nGlobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. If global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\nSlower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.\nIn the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\nWe conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies, including in response to certain policies advocated or implemented by the U.S. presidential administration, could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.\nContinued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.\nIf retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\nIf retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers.\nIf contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers may be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\nFailure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.\nTo meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.\nConsolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products.\nThe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. These retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. These situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. In addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.\nOur NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nOur NIKE Direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct operations, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business.\nIf the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.\nMany of our customers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, customers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors, and to do comparison shopping. We are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nFailure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\nWe periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products.\nThe actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.\nWe may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products.\nWe take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.\nIn addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.\nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.\nIn addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Any breach of our or our service providers network, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers, users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.\nIn addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR) and regulations can be costly; any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nFailure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business.\nWe work with hundreds of contractors outside of the United States to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses.\nOur international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\nVirtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union, as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the U.S. and elsewhere as further described below under We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate and Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The U.S. presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations. The administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain U.S. multinational corporations in public statements which, if directed at us, could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), which includes a number of significant changes to previous U.S. tax laws that impact us, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, among other changes. The Tax Act also transitions U.S. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to U.S. taxation.\nImplementation of the Tax Act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018, which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018. Adjustments to the incremental provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to, among other factors, a change in interpretation of the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates, regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code, and state tax implications. As we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts we have recorded, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes or challenges to or the repeal of the Tax Act cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material impact on our future tax expense.\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. There have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows.\nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. These tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective income tax rate would increase in the future.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, particularly in light of the enactment of the Tax Act. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nAs a result of recent policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and recent U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.\nNIKE is supplied by 124 footwear factories located in 13 countries. We do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. In fiscal 2018, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2018 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of NIKE Brand footwear production in fiscal 2018. Our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\nThe principal materials used in our apparel products - natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware - are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. The principal materials used in our footwear products - natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films - are also locally available to manufacturers. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured.\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.\nBecause independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, Sojitz America performs significant import-export financing services for the Company. During fiscal 2018, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay (collectively the Sojitz Markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz Americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the Sojitz Markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability.\nOur success depends on our global distribution facilities.\nWe distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.\nWe rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet and third-party services (Information Technology Systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, or failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.\nThe market for prime real estate is competitive.\nOur ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nExtreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.\nFrom time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our digital commerce operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations.\nWe are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel.\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the U.S.\nThe sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.\nAs of June 30, 2018, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned more than 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 30, 2018, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 17%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Swoosh, LLC is controlled by Mr. Knight's son and NIKE director, Travis Knight.\nChanges in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.\nOur long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poors and Moodys Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.\nIf our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, hedge accounting for derivatives, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.\nThere are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. Analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. ITEM 2. Properties\nThe following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE:\nThe NIKE World Campus, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is an approximately 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with adjacent leased properties, functions as our world headquarters and is occupied by approximately 11,200 employees engaged in management, research, design, development, marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our divisions. We also lease various office facilities in the surrounding metropolitan area. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which serves as the headquarters for the Europe, Middle East & Africa geography and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for Greater China, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, NIKE Direct and merchandising strategies in the region, among other functions.\nIn the United States, NIKE has seven significant distribution centers. Five are located in Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three of which are leased. Two other distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. NIKE Brand apparel and equipment are also shipped from our Foothill Ranch, California distribution center, which we lease. Smaller leased, and third-party leased and operated, distribution facilities are located in various parts of the United States. NIKE has several distribution facilities outside the United States, some of which are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. The most significant distribution facilities outside the United States are located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Incheon, Korea, all of which we own.\nAir Manufacturing Innovation manufactures Air-Sole cushioning components at NIKE-owned facilities and one leased facility located near Beaverton, Oregon and in St. Charles, Missouri. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers.\nAside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes. We lease 1,181 retail stores worldwide, which primarily consist of factory stores. See United States Market and International Markets in Part I of this Report. Our leases expire at various dates through the year 2035. ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings\nThere are no material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject. ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNIKEs Class B Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol NKE. At July 20, 2018, there were 22,271 holders of record of our Class B Common Stock and 15 holders of record of our Class A Common Stock. These figures do not include beneficial owners who hold shares in nominee name. The Class A Common Stock is not publicly traded, but each share is convertible upon request of the holder into one share of Class B Common Stock.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our NIKE Direct operations), to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, must have products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\nIn June 2017, we announced the Consumer Direct Offense, a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. Leveraging the power of digital, NIKE plans to drive growth - by accelerating innovation and product creation, moving even closer to the consumer through key cities, and deepening one-to-one connections. As a result of this organizational realignment, beginning in fiscal 2018, the Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA).\nThrough the Consumer Direct Offense, we are focusing on our Triple Double strategy, with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers. As a result of the execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2023, on average, per year, are as follows:\nHigh single-digit revenue growth;\nGross margin expansion of as much as 50 basis points;\nSlight selling and administrative expense leverage;\nMid-teens earnings per share growth; and\nLow-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital.\nOver the past ten years, we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics. During this time, revenues for NIKE, Inc. have grown 7% on an annual compounded basis, annual gross margin has ranged from 43.5% to 46.4%, diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 34.7%.\nOur fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio to generate revenue growth, while investing in capabilities in support of our Triple Double strategy to fuel our next phase of long-term growth and profitability. We achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018, growing 6% to $36.4 billion. The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, delivered 7% revenue growth. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand revenues grew 5%, driven by strong revenue growth across all international geographies and NIKE Direct, as well as growth in footwear, apparel and most key categories. Revenues for Converse decreased 8% and 11% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively, primarily driven by lower revenues in North America.\nIncome before income taxes decreased 11% for fiscal 2018, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue growth was more than offset by higher selling and administrative expense, gross margin contraction, and a shift to other expense, net from other income, net for fiscal 2017. NIKE, Inc. gross margin decreased 80 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate headwinds. Selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues, reflecting investments in digital capabilities, consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive long-term growth under the Consumer Direct Offense.\nDiluted earnings per common share reflects a 2% decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.\nWhile foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Additionally, currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures when evaluating the Companys performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. However, references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currency-neutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nResults of Operations\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n$\n36,397\n$\n34,350\n%\n$\n32,376\n%\nCost of sales\n20,441\n19,038\n%\n17,405\n%\nGross profit\n15,956\n15,312\n%\n14,971\n%\nGross margin\n43.8\n%\n44.6\n%\n46.2\n%\nDemand creation expense\n3,577\n3,341\n%\n3,278\n%\nOperating overhead expense\n7,934\n7,222\n%\n7,191\n%\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n11,511\n10,563\n%\n10,469\n%\n% of revenues\n31.6\n%\n30.8\n%\n32.3\n%\nInterest expense (income), net\n-\n-\nOther expense (income), net\n(196\n)\n-\n(140\n)\n-\nIncome before income taxes\n4,325\n4,886\n%\n4,623\n%\nIncome tax expense\n2,392\n%\n%\nEffective tax rate\n55.3\n%\n13.2\n%\n18.7\n%\nNET INCOME\n$\n1,933\n$\n4,240\n%\n$\n3,760\n%\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n1.17\n$\n2.51\n%\n$\n2.16\n%\nConsolidated Operating Results\nRevenues\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017(1)\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)\nFiscal 2016(1)\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)\nNIKE, Inc.

Revenues grew 4% for fiscal 2018, driven by growth in the NIKE Brand. All international NIKE Brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2018 as our Consumer Direct Offense delivered innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through digital platforms and at NIKE-owned and retail partner stores, driving demand for NIKE Brand products. Revenue growth was broad-based, as Greater China, EMEA and APLA each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues. For fiscal 2018, lower revenues from North America and Converse each reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2018, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 4%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in Sportswear and Running, which was partially offset by lower revenues in several other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2018 increased 2% and higher average selling price (ASP) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.\nThe currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories, most notably Sportswear, NIKE Basketball and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 4% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher ASPs from full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct sales.\nFor fiscal 2018, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 30% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 28% for fiscal 2017. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 12% for fiscal 2018, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25%, the addition of new stores and 4% comparable store sales growth. Comparable store sales include revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.8 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017, and represented approximately 27% of our total NIKE Brand NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24% for fiscal 2017.\nOn a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2018 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 5%, as growth in Sportswear, Running and NIKE Basketball more than offset lower Football (Soccer) and Jordan Brand revenues. Womens revenues increased 2%, led by growth in Sportswear, partially offset by a decline in Training. Revenues for our Young Athletes business decreased 1%, as growth in Football (Soccer), was more than offset by lower revenues in the Jordan Brand.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. Revenues grew 8% for fiscal 2017, driven by higher revenues for all NIKE Brand geographies and Converse. Revenue growth was broad-based, as EMEA, Greater China, APLA and North America each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in NIKE, Inc. Revenues.\nOn a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 8% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2017, while NIKE Brand equipment revenues decreased 3%. On a category basis, the increase in NIKE Brand footwear revenues was driven by strong growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand. Footwear unit sales for fiscal 2017 increased 7%, with higher ASP per pair contributing approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth, primarily driven by higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially offset by the impact of higher off-price sales.\nThe currency-neutral increase in NIKE Brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was fueled by growth in all key categories, led by Sportswear, Running and Training. Unit sales of apparel increased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, growth in our higher-priced NIKE Direct business.\nFor fiscal 2017, NIKE Direct revenues represented approximately 28% of our total NIKE Brand revenues compared to 26% for fiscal 2016. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 18% for fiscal 2017, driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 30%, the addition of new stores and 7% comparable store sales growth. On a reported basis, digital commerce sales, which are not included in comparable store sales, were $2.2 billion for fiscal 2017 compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2016 and represented approximately 24% of our total NIKE Direct revenues for fiscal 2017 compared to 22% for fiscal 2016.\nOn a wholesale equivalent and currency-neutral basis, fiscal 2017 NIKE Brand Mens revenues increased 6%, driven by significant growth in Sportswear, Running and the Jordan Brand, while Womens revenues increased 8%, led by growth in Sportswear and Running. Revenues for our Young Athletes business increased 8%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the Jordan Brand.\nGross Margin\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nGross profit\n$\n15,956\n$\n15,312\n%\n$\n14,971\n%\nGross margin\n43.8\n%\n44.6\n%\n(80\n) bps\n46.2\n%\n(160\n) bps\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nFor fiscal 2018, our consolidated gross margin was 80 basis points lower than fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the following factors:\nUnfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points);\nLower NIKE Direct margin (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points) reflecting higher mix of off-price sales in the first half of fiscal 2018, which was partially offset by margin expansion in the second half of fiscal 2018;\nNIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, which was flat for fiscal 2018 as higher discounts in the first half of fiscal 2018 were offset by higher full-price ASP in the second half of the year; and\nNIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, which were flat.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nFor fiscal 2017, our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by the following factors:\nHigher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis (increasing gross margin approximately 70 basis points) aligned with our strategy to deliver innovative, premium products to the consumer;\nHigher NIKE Brand product costs (decreasing gross margin approximately 100 basis points) as an increase in the mix of higher cost products and labor input cost inflation more than offset lower material input costs;\nUnfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 90 basis points); and\nLower NIKE Direct margins (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points) reflecting the impact of higher off-price sales.\nTotal Selling and Administrative Expense\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nDemand creation expense(1)\n$\n3,577\n$\n3,341\n%\n$\n3,278\n%\nOperating overhead expense\n7,934\n7,222\n%\n7,191\n%\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n$\n11,511\n$\n10,563\n%\n$\n10,469\n%\n% of revenues\n31.6\n%\n30.8\n%\nbps\n32.3\n%\n(150\n) bps\n(1)\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nDemand creation expense increased 7% for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, driven by higher sports marketing costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 3 percentage points for fiscal 2018.\nOperating overhead expense increased 10% compared to fiscal 2017, due to higher administrative costs, continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business and one-time wage-related costs associated with the Consumer Direct Offense organizational realignment. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nDemand creation expense increased 2% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, driven by higher sports marketing costs, as well as higher marketing and advertising costs, primarily to support key sporting events including the Rio Olympics and European Football Championship. These increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point.\nOperating overhead expense was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\n(In millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\nFiscal 2016\nOther expense (income), net\n$\n$\n(196\n)\n$\n(140\n)\nOther expense (income), net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions outside the normal course of business.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOther expense (income), net changed from $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017 to $66 million of other expense, net for fiscal 2018, primarily due to a $287 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges.\nWe estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $110 million for fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nOther expense (income), net increased from $140 million of other income, net for fiscal 2016 to $196 million of other income, net for fiscal 2017, primarily due to a $56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses.\nWe estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $59 million for fiscal 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nEffective tax rate\n55.3\n%\n13.2\n%\n4,210\nbps\n18.7\n%\n(550\n) bps\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOur effective tax rate was 55.3% for fiscal 2018, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The impact of the Tax Act primarily reflects provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and $158 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the Tax Act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stock-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the impact of ASU 2016-09, and Note 9 - Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nThe 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States.\nOperating Segments\nOur operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.\nEach NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands.\nThe Companys NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.\nAs part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in our geographic operating segments and Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\nThe breakdown of revenues is as follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017(1)\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)\nFiscal 2016(1)\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes(2)\nNorth America\n$\n14,855\n$\n15,216\n%\n%\n$\n14,764\n%\n%\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n9,242\n7,970\n%\n%\n7,568\n%\n%\nGreater China\n5,134\n4,237\n%\n%\n3,785\n%\n%\nAsia Pacific & Latin America\n5,166\n4,737\n%\n%\n4,317\n%\n%\nGlobal Brand Divisions(3)\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTOTAL NIKE BRAND\n34,485\n32,233\n%\n%\n30,507\n%\n%\nConverse\n1,886\n2,042\n%\n%\n1,955\n%\n%\nCorporate(4)\n-\n-\n(86\n)\n-\n-\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

Consumers are demanding a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, and have an expectation for superior service and real-time delivery, all fueled by the shift toward digital. Specifically, in North America we anticipate continued evolution within the retail landscape, driven by shifting consumer traffic patterns across digital and physical channels. The evolution of the North America marketplace has resulted in third-party retail store closures; however, we are currently seeing stabilization and momentum building in our business, fueled by innovative product and NIKE Brand consumer experiences, leveraging digital.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nNorth America revenues decreased 2%, as growth in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories was more than offset by declines in all other categories, most notably the Jordan Brand and Running. NIKE Direct revenues increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to digital commerce sales growth and the addition of new stores.\nFootwear revenues declined 4% for fiscal 2018, as lower revenues in nearly all categories, most notably the Jordan Brand, more than offset higher revenues in Sportswear. Unit sales of footwear decreased 5%, while ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear growth, driven by the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.\nApparel revenue growth of 1% for fiscal 2018 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and NIKE Basketball categories, which was only partially offset by declines in nearly all other categories. Unit sales of apparel decreased 4%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher full-price ASP and favorable changes in off-price sales.\nEBIT declined 7% for fiscal 2018, primarily reflecting lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin declined 10 basis points as lower full-price ASP more than offset the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead expense resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business. Demand creation expense also increased, as higher sports marketing costs were only partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nNorth America revenues increased 3%, driven by growth in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories, including NIKE Basketball. NIKE Direct revenues increased 9% for fiscal 2017 due to digital commerce sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 3%.\nFootwear revenue growth for fiscal 2017 was attributable to higher revenues in our Sportswear and Jordan Brand categories, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of footwear increased 4%, while ASP per pair was flat as higher off-price ASP was offset by unfavorable off-price mix.\nThe increase in apparel revenues for fiscal 2017 was due to growth concentrated in Sportswear, partially offset by declines in other categories. Unit sales of apparel grew 2% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price ASP.\nEBIT grew 3% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. Gross margin increased 10 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable off-price margin more than offset higher product costs and increased off-price mix as a result of clearing excess inventories through off-price channels, including through our NIKE Direct business. Selling and administrative expense grew due to higher operating overhead as continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business were partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Demand creation was flat as higher sports marketing and retail brand presentation costs offset lower marketing and advertising costs.\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes\nRevenues by:\nFootwear\n$\n5,875\n$\n5,192\n%\n%\n$\n5,043\n%\n%\nApparel\n2,940\n2,395\n%\n%\n2,149\n%\n%\nEquipment\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n9,242\n$\n7,970\n%\n%\n$\n7,568\n%\n%\nRevenues by:\nSales to Wholesale Customers\n$\n6,765\n$\n5,917\n%\n%\n$\n5,869\n%\n%\nSales through NIKE Direct\n2,477\n2,053\n%\n%\n1,699\n%\n%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n9,242\n$\n7,970\n%\n%\n$\n7,568\n%\n%\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES\n$\n1,587\n$\n1,507\n%\n$\n1,787\n%\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOn a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in every territory, most notably our UK & Ireland territory, which grew 21%. Revenues increased in nearly all key categories, led by Sportswear and Football (Soccer). NIKE Direct revenues grew 13% for fiscal 2018 due to strong digital commerce sales growth, comparable store sales growth of 6% and the addition of new stores.\nThe 6% increase in currency-neutral footwear revenues for fiscal 2018 was due to growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear. For fiscal 2018, unit sales of footwear increased 6% while ASP per pair was flat, as higher off-price ASP was offset by lower full-price ASP.\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues grew 16% for fiscal 2018, driven by higher revenues in all key categories, most notably Sportswear and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel increased 12% and higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to higher full-price ASP.\nReported EBIT increased 5% for fiscal 2018 due to revenue growth and slight selling and administrative expense leverage, which was partially offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 180 basis points as lower product costs were more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower full-price ASP due to product mix, and lower NIKE Direct margin. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense driven by sports marketing and advertising costs. Operating overhead also increased primarily due to continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business and, to a lesser extent, higher administrative costs.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nOn a currency-neutral basis, EMEA revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 10%.

Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business.\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenue growth was driven by higher revenues in all key categories, most notably Sportswear and, to a lesser extent, Training and Football (Soccer). Unit sales of apparel for fiscal 2017 increased 12%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. The increase in ASP per unit was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of growth in our NIKE Direct business and higher full-price ASP.\nReported EBIT decreased 16% for fiscal 2017, in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates. Higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by significant gross margin contraction. Gross margin declined 530 basis points primarily driven by the effects of significant unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation expense, as increased sports marketing and advertising expenses more than offset lower marketing costs. Operating overhead also increased due to continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation costs.\nGreater China\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\n% Change Excluding Currency Changes\nRevenues by:\nFootwear\n$\n3,496\n$\n2,920\n%\n%\n$\n2,599\n%\n%\nApparel\n1,508\n1,188\n%\n%\n1,055\n%\n%\nEquipment\n%\n%\n%\n%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n5,134\n$\n4,237\n%\n%\n$\n3,785\n%\n%\nRevenues by:\nSales to Wholesale Customers\n$\n3,216\n$\n2,774\n%\n%\n$\n2,623\n%\n%\nSales through NIKE Direct\n1,918\n1,463\n%\n%\n1,162\n%\n%\nTOTAL REVENUES\n$\n5,134\n$\n4,237\n%\n%\n$\n3,785\n%\n%\nEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES\n$\n1,807\n$\n1,507\n%\n$\n1,372\n%\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOn a currency-neutral basis, Greater China revenues for fiscal 2018 increased 18%, driven by higher revenues in all key categories, led by Running, Sportswear and the Jordan Brand.

The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP and, to a lesser extent, favorable off-price mix and higher off-price ASP.\nReported EBIT increased 21% due to revenue growth, strong selling and administrative expense leverage and gross margin expansion. Gross margin increased 90 basis points as higher full-price ASP and favorable standard foreign currency exchange rates more than offset higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased as higher operating overhead costs resulting from continued investments in our growing NIKE Direct business more than offset lower demand creation expense. The decrease in demand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower marketing costs as a result of prior year investments to support the Rio Olympics.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nOn a currency-neutral basis, APLA revenues for fiscal 2017 increased 13%.

The increase in ASP per unit was primarily driven by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories.\nReported EBIT decreased 2%, in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Argentine Peso and Mexican Peso. Reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin. Gross margin decreased 370 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing NIKE Direct business, partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies.

The largest direct distribution markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and China. We do not own the Converse trademarks in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan. Territories other than direct distribution markets and Japan are serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalty revenues to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nOn a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse declined 11% for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution markets (i.e., markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years) declined 12%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 11 percentage points for fiscal 2018. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 14%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the decrease in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to declines in both the United States and Europe, in part reflecting efforts to manage inventory levels in the marketplace, partially offset by revenue growth in Asia. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2018. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 14%, reducing total Converse revenues by approximately 1 percentage point, driven by lower revenues in Latin America.\nReported EBIT declined 35% for fiscal 2018 driven by lower revenues, higher selling and administrative expense and, to a lesser extent, gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 100 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by higher product costs and the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Higher operating overhead expense was due to continued investment in our direct to consumer business and, to a lesser extent, higher wage-related costs, while higher demand creation expense was due to increased marketing support for initiatives to drive growth.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nOn a currency-neutral basis, revenues for Converse increased 6% for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution markets grew 4%, contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total Converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017. Comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth. On a territory basis, the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the United States, partially offset by lower revenues in Europe. Conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total Converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017, primarily driven by the market transition in Italy. Revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5%, having an insignificant impact to total Converse revenue. The decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in Latin America.\nReported EBIT declined 2% for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction. Gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher full-price ASP was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs, primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products. Gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues, primarily due to market transitions. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs, partially offset by higher advertising expense. Operating overhead increased as higher wage-related expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs.\nCorporate\n(Dollars in millions)\nFiscal 2018\nFiscal 2017\n% Change\nFiscal 2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n$\n$\n-\n$\n(86\n)\n-\n(Loss) Before Interest and Taxes\n$\n(1,456\n)\n$\n(724\n)\n%\n$\n(1,173\n)\n%\nCorporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.\nThe Corporate loss before interest and taxes largely consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.\nIn addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.\nFiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017\nFor fiscal 2018, Corporates loss before interest and taxes increased $732 million primarily due to the following:\na detrimental change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $281 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other expense (income), net;\nan unfavorable change of $255 million, primarily due to higher operating overhead expense driven by higher wage-related costs, in part reflecting one-time costs associated with our organizational realignment in the first half of fiscal 2018, as well as higher administrative costs; and\na detrimental change of $196 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016\nFor fiscal 2017, Corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased $449 million primarily due to the following:\na beneficial change of $280 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin;\na beneficial change of $115 million, primarily driven by lower variable compensation and administrative costs in operating overhead expense; and\nan increase in net foreign currency gains of $54 million related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, reported as a component of consolidated Other expense (income), net.\nForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices\nOverview\nAs a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company (NTC) and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded, as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.\nTransactional Exposures\nWe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:\nProduct Costs - NIKEs product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\n1.\nProduct purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\na.\nCertain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\nb.\nOther NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\n2.\nFactory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated.\nFor the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within Inventories and is recognized in Cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. All currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases NIKEs U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales - A portion of our EMEA geography revenues, as well as a portion of our Converse European operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\nOther Costs - Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. In certain cases, the Company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through Other expense (income), net. Refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.\nNon-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities - Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in Other expense (income), net within our consolidated results of operations.\nManaging Transactional Exposures\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above.\nCertain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in Other expense (income), net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged.\nTranslational Exposures\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a benefit of approximately $832 million and a detriment of approximately $542 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately $177 million and a detriment of approximately $115 million for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nManagement generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Beginning in fiscal 2019, we anticipate the functional currency of our Argentina subsidiary within our APLA operating segment will change from the local currency to U.S. Dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyper-inflationary market. As a result, its non-U.S. Dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to re-measurement and recorded in Other expense (income), net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income beginning in fiscal 2019. Although we continue to evaluate the impact, at current rates, we do not anticipate the re-measurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nManaging Translational Exposures\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated securities at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in Other expense (income), net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $110 million and $59 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNet Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018 and 2017. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow Activity\nCash provided by operations was $4,955 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $3,846 million for fiscal 2017. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $3,473 million of operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 compared to $4,781 million for fiscal 2017. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $1,482 million for fiscal 2018, compared to a decrease of $935 million for fiscal 2017. Impacting the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of $1,172 million for the transition tax under the Tax Act, which will be paid in cash over an eight-year period. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes for additional information on the Tax Act. Cash provided by operations was also impacted by the change in Accounts Receivable, net, which decreased $187 million, primarily due to improved collection timing, compared to an increase of $426 million in fiscal 2017.\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $276 million for fiscal 2018, compared to an outflow of $1,008 million for fiscal 2017, driven primarily by the net change in short-term investments. During fiscal 2018, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,326 million compared to an inflow of $118 million in fiscal 2017.\nIn fiscal 2019, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, including corporate facilities, expanding our digital capabilities and new NIKE Direct stores. We continue to expect such investments to approximate 3% to 4% of revenues, on average.\nCash used by financing activities was $4,835 million for fiscal 2018 compared to $2,148 million for fiscal 2017. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by $1,482 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2017, which did not recur in fiscal 2018. The increase in Cash used by financing activities was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock, which resulted in a cash outflow of $4,254 million for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of $3,223 million for fiscal 2017.\nIn fiscal 2018, we purchased 69.7 million shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock for $4,267 million (an average price of $61.25 per share) under the four-year, $12 billion program approved by the Board of Directors in November 2015. As of May 31, 2018, we had repurchased 149.4 million shares at a cost of $8,704 million (an average price of $58.25 per share) under this program. Although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions, we currently anticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019. In June 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new four-year, $15 billion program to repurchase shares of NIKEs Class B Common Stock, which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows, excess cash and/or proceeds from debt.\nCapital Resources\nOn July 21, 2016, we filed a shelf registration statement (the Shelf) with the SEC which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2019. For additional detail refer to Note 8 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn August 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility.\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively. If our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. Under this facility, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2018, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program. During the year ended May 31, 2018, the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was $1.4 billion. As of May 31, 2018, there were $325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program. We may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs. We currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively.\nTo date, in fiscal 2018, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs; however, future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\nAs of May 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.2 billion, primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2018, the weighted-average days to maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 33 days.\nWe believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nContractual Obligations\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2018, and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:\nDescription of Commitment\nCash Payments Due During the Year Ending May 31,\n(In millions)\nThereafter\nTotal\nOperating Leases\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,608\n$\n3,965\nCapital Leases and Other Financing Obligations(1)\nLong-Term Debt(2)\n4,713\n5,773\nEndorsement Contracts(3)\n1,391\n1,306\n1,158\n1,266\n4,438\n10,501\nProduct Purchase Obligations(4)\n4,566\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n4,566\nOther Purchase Obligations(5)\n1,437\n2,646\nTransition Tax Related to the Tax Act(6)\n1,172\nTOTAL\n$\n8,236\n$\n2,587\n$\n2,157\n$\n2,011\n$\n2,112\n$\n11,944\n$\n29,047\n(1)\nCapital leases and other financing obligations include payments related to build-to-suit lease arrangements.\n(2)\nThe cash payments due for long-term debt include estimated interest payments. Estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of May 31, 2018 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.\n(3)\nThe amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.\nIn addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. The amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.\n(4)\nWe generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our NIKE Direct in-line stores and digital commerce operations. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.\n(5)\nOther purchase obligations primarily include construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.\n(6)\nRepresents a provisional estimate of the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we expect to utilize. Actual amounts could vary as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes and Note 13 - Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.\nWe also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of May 31, 2018. Refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.\nOutstanding as\nof May 31, 2018\n(In millions)\nNotes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand\n$\nPayable to Sojitz America for the purchase of inventories, generally due 60 days after shipment of goods from a foreign port\nAs of May 31, 2018, the Company had letters of credit outstanding totaling $165 million. These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe believe the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThese policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. Title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.\nIn some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.\nIn certain countries, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. In these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. On the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. Our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. We base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. In the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to Operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.\nInventory Reserves\nWe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.\nContingent Payments under Endorsement Contracts\nA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. We expense these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nHedge Accounting for Derivatives\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Other comprehensive income into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Other comprehensive income to Other expense (income), net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. Expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. Our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. If factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. In accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we recorded provisional amounts, which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS), U.S. Treasury Department, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Companys accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date.\nRefer to Note 9 - Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. We record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. While we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\nMarket Risk Measurement\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (VaR). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt.\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a variance/co-variance technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $93 million and $97 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The VAR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at May 31, 2018. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $260 million and $161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.\nDetails of third-party debt are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.\nExpected Maturity Date\nYear Ending May 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nThereafter\nTotal\nFair\nValue\nForeign Exchange Risk\nJapanese Yen Functional Currency\nLong-term Japanese Yen debt - Fixed rate\nPrincipal payments\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nAverage interest rate\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n2.4\n%\nInterest Rate Risk\nJapanese Yen Functional Currency\nLong-term Japanese Yen debt - Fixed rate\nPrincipal payments\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nAverage interest rate\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\n2.4\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n2.4\n%\nU.S. Dollar Functional Currency\nLong-term U.S. Dollar debt - Fixed rate\nPrincipal payments\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n3,000\n$\n3,500\n$\n3,279\nAverage interest rate\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n0.0\n%\n2.3\n%\n3.3\n%\n3.1\n%\nThe fixed interest rate Japanese Yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our Japanese subsidiaries.

ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nManagement of NIKE, Inc. is responsible for the information and representations contained in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include certain amounts based on our best estimates and judgments. Other financial information in this report is consistent with these financial statements.\nOur accounting systems include controls designed to reasonably assure assets are safeguarded from unauthorized use or disposition and provide for the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. These systems are supplemented by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel and an organizational structure providing for appropriate segregation of duties.\nAn internal corporate audit department reviews the results of its work with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors, presently comprised of three outside, independent directors. The Audit & Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews, with the independent registered public accounting firm, management and the internal corporate audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual audit, the effectiveness of the accounting control system and other matters relating to the financial affairs of NIKE as the Audit & Finance Committee deems appropriate. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal corporate auditors have full access to the Audit & Finance Committee, with and without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate matters.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) - 15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nWhile reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, it does not mean absolute assurance. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect every misstatement and instance of fraud. Controls are susceptible to manipulation, especially in instances of fraud caused by the collusion of two or more people, including our senior management. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2018.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, as stated in their report herein.\nMark G. Parker\nAndrew Campion\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nChief Financial Officer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based payment awards to employees as of June 1, 2017.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/S/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPortland, Oregon\nJuly 24, 2018\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1974.\nNIKE, Inc.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across a wide range of sport categories, amplified with sport-inspired sportswear products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. The Hurley brand is focused on surf and action sports and youth lifestyle footwear, apparel and accessories, using the Hurley trademark. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products are reported within the NIKE Brands North America geographic operating segment. Converse designs, distributes, markets and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nOn November 19, 2015, the Company announced a two-for-one split of both NIKE Class A and Class B Common Stock. The stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on December 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 9, 2015. Common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 24, 2015. All share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation, including reclassified geographic operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Companys operating structure, which became effective on June 1, 2017. Refer to Note 17 - Operating Segments and Related Information for additional information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, management identified a misstatement related to the historical allocation of repurchases of Class B Common stock between Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings. The Company assessed the materiality of these misstatements on prior period financial statements in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, codified in ASC 250, Presentation of Financial Statements, and concluded that these misstatements were not material to any prior annual or interim period. As such, the Company has revised the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2017, and has reduced Capital in excess of stated value by $2.9 billion and increased Retained earnings by the same amount. Within the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, the Company has made corresponding revisions of $2.6 billion, $0.1 billion and $0.2 billion for the periods ended May 31, 2015, 2016 and, 2017, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nWholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. This occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Amounts collected from customers for sales or value added tax are recorded on a net basis. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. Post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. Estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, the Companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $675 million and $643 million, respectively.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.\nDemand Creation Expense\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.\nA significant amount of the Companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Companys best estimate of the endorsers performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Companys estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. The Company expenses these payments in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. In certain contracts, the Company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. For contracts the Company estimates will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the Company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in Demand creation expense uniformly over the contract period.\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses customers for certain costs of advertising the Companys products. The Company records these costs in Demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. This obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.\nTotal advertising and promotion expenses, which the Company refers to as Demand creation expense, were $3,577 million, $3,341 million and $3,278 million for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $730 million and $558 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $359 million and $311 million, respectively, was recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $371 million and $247 million, respectively, was recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.\nOperating Overhead Expense\nOperating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, as well as other administrative expenses, such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, meetings and travel.\nCash and Equivalents\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.\nShort-Term Investments\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. Debt securities the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. At May 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not hold any short-term investments classified as trading or held-to-maturity.\nAt May 31, 2018 and 2017, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Companys short-term investments.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the allowance, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $30 million and $19 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value, and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Companys suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\nSoftware Development Costs\nInternal Use Software: Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 12-year period on a straight-line basis. The Companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. In addition, the Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\nComputer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed: Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. The two-step impairment test first requires the Company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the Company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, the Company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. If a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the Company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires the Company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.\nOperating Leases\nThe Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. Operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is generally determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. A contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the Company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Inputs other than observable quoted prices for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. Treasury securities. Assets and liabilities included within Level 2 include commercial paper, U.S. Agency securities, money market funds, time deposits, corporate debt securities and derivative contracts. Level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs and are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\nThe Companys fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.\nRefer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\nForeign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Total shareholders equity.\nThe Companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other expense (income), net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of Total shareholders equity), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash used by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes this fair value as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the vesting period using the straight-line method.\nRefer to Note 11 - Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Companys stock-based compensation programs.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.\nRefer to Note 9 - Income Taxes for further discussion.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.\nRefer to Note 12 - Earnings Per Share for further discussion.\nManagement Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The standard allows for reclassification of stranded tax effects on items resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) from Accumulated other comprehensive income to Retained earnings. Tax effects unrelated to the Tax Act are released from Accumulated other comprehensive income using either the specific identification approach or the portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.\nThe Company early adopted the ASU in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. As a result of the adoption, Retained earnings decreased by $17 million, with a corresponding increase to Accumulated other comprehensive income due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees. The Company adopted the ASU in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The updated guidance requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies from share-based payment awards to be recorded in income tax expense in the income statement. Previously, excess tax benefits and deficiencies were recognized in shareholders equity on the balance sheet. This change is required to be applied prospectively. As a result of the adoption, during fiscal 2018, the Company recognized $230 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based payment awards in Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAdditionally, ASU 2016-09 modified the classification of certain share-based payment activities within the statement of cash flows, which the Company applied retrospectively. As a result, for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, the Company reclassified cash inflows of $177 million and $281 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits from share-based payment awards, from Cash used by financing activities to Cash provided by operations, and reclassified cash outflows of $29 million and $22 million, for the respective periods, related to tax payments for the net settlement of share-based payment awards, from Cash provided by operations to Cash used by financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which expands and refines hedge accounting for both financial and non-financial risk components, aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of hedging instruments and hedge items in the financial statements, and includes certain targeted improvements to ease the application of current guidance related to the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The update to the standard is effective for the Company on June 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted in any interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the updated guidance, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018, using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption. Upon adoption, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment reducing Retained earnings, Deferred income taxes and other assets, and Prepaid expenses and other current assets by $507 million, $422 million and $45 million, respectively, and increasing Deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $40 million.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2019. The ASU is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest period presented, with optional practical expedients. The Company continues to assess the effect the guidance will have on its existing accounting policies and the Consolidated Financial Statements and expects there will be an increase in assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at adoption due to the recording of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities, which may be material. Refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies for information about the Companys lease obligations.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure. The update to the standard is effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires reporting companies to disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company will adopt the standard on June 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard recognized in retained earnings at the date of adoption.\nWhile the Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Companys net Revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income, revenues for certain wholesale transactions and substantially all digital commerce sales will be recognized upon shipment rather than upon delivery to the customer. Accordingly, the Company will record a cumulative effect adjustment increasing Retained earnings by approximately $23 million on June 1, 2018.\nAdditionally, provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims will be recognized as accrued liabilities rather than as reductions to Accounts receivable, net; and the estimated cost of inventory associated with the provision for sales returns will be recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining provisions of the standard are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 2 - Inventories\nInventory balances of $5,261 million and $5,055 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were substantially all finished goods.\nNOTE 3 - Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net included the following:\nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\nLand and improvements\n$\n$\nBuildings\n2,195\n1,564\nMachinery, equipment and internal-use software\n4,230\n3,867\nLeasehold improvements\n1,494\n1,484\nConstruction in process\nTotal property, plant and equipment, gross\n8,891\n7,958\nLess accumulated depreciation\n4,437\n3,969\nTOTAL PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\n$\n4,454\n$\n3,989\nCapitalized interest was not material for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.\nNOTE 4 - Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIdentifiable intangible assets, net consist of indefinite-lived trademarks, which are not subject to amortization, and acquired trademarks and other intangible assets, which are subject to amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys Identifiable intangible assets, net balances as of May 31, 2018 and 2017:\nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet Carrying Amount\nAcquired trademarks and other\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nIndefinite-lived trademarks\n-\n-\nINDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nGoodwill was $154 million and $139 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which $65 million was included in the Converse segment for both periods.

The Companys derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Companys credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities, the latter of which would further offset against the Companys derivative asset balance (refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives). Any amounts of cash collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Companys credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which would further offset against the Companys derivative liability balance (refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives). Cash collateral received or posted related to the Companys credit related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets pursuant to U.S. GAAP.\nThe following tables present information about the Companys derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and indicate the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the Company classifies the fair value measurement.\nAs of May 31, 2018\nDerivative Assets\nDerivative Liabilities\n(In millions)\nAssets at Fair Value\nOther Current Assets\nOther Long-term Assets\nLiabilities at Fair Value\nAccrued Liabilities\nOther Long-term Liabilities\nLevel 2:\nForeign exchange forwards and options(1)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n-\nEmbedded derivatives\nTOTAL\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\nIf the foreign exchange derivative instruments had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $182 million as of May 31, 2018.

As of that date, no amount of cash collateral had been received or posted on the derivative asset and liability balance related to these foreign exchange derivative instruments.\nAvailable-for-sale securities comprise investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, time deposits, money market funds, corporate commercial paper and bonds. These securities are valued using market prices on both active markets (Level 1) and less active markets (Level 2). As of May 31, 2018, the Company held $960 million of available-for-sale securities with maturity dates within one year and $36 million with maturity dates over one year and less than five years within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities included in Accumulated other comprehensive income were immaterial as of May 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company regularly reviews its available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not consider its securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, and accordingly, did not recognize any impairment losses.\nIncluded in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Companys available-for-sale securities of $70 million, $27 million and $12 million for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Companys Level 3 assets comprise investments in certain non-marketable preferred stock. These Level 3 investments are an immaterial portion of the Companys portfolio. Changes in Level 3 investment assets were immaterial during the years ended May 31, 2018 and 2017.\nNo transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy occurred during the years ended May 31, 2018 or 2017.\nFor additional information related to the Companys derivative financial instruments, refer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives. For fair value information regarding Notes Payable and Long-term debt, refer to Note 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 8 - Long-Term Debt, respectively. The carrying amounts of other current financial assets and other current financial liabilities approximate fair value.\nAs of May 31, 2018 and 2017, assets or liabilities required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis were immaterial.\nNOTE 7 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines\nNotes payable and interest-bearing accounts payable to Sojitz Corporation of America (Sojitz America) as of May 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below:\nAs of May 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\nBorrowings\nInterest Rate\nBorrowings\nInterest Rate\nNotes payable:\nCommercial paper\n$\n1.77\n%\n$\n0.86\n%\nU.S. operations\n0.00\n%\n(1)\n-\n0.00\n%\n(1)\nNon-U.S. operations\n18.11\n%\n(1)\n-\n0.00\n%\n(1)\nTOTAL NOTES PAYABLE\n$\n$\nInterest-bearing accounts payable:\nSojitz America\n$\n2.82\n%\n$\n1.78\n%\n(1)\nWeighted average interest rate includes non-interest bearing overdrafts.\nThe carrying amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value.\nThe Company purchases through Sojitz America certain NIKE Brand products it acquires from non-U.S. suppliers. These purchases are for products sold in certain countries in the Companys Asia Pacific & Latin America geographic operating segment and Canada, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Accounts payable to Sojitz America are generally due up to 60 days after shipment of goods from the foreign port. The interest rate on such accounts payable is the 60-day London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as of the beginning of the month of the invoice date, plus 0.75%.\nAs of May 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had $325 million outstanding under its $2 billion commercial paper program at weighted average interest rates of 1.77% and 0.86%, respectively.\nOn August 28, 2015, the Company entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. The facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022. Based on the Companys current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poors Corporation and Moodys Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing LIBOR plus 0.455%. The facility fee is 0.045% of the total commitment. Under the committed credit facility, the Company must maintain certain financial ratios, among other things, with which the Company was in compliance at May 31, 2018. No amounts were outstanding under the committed credit facility as of May 31, 2018 or 2017.\nNOTE 8 - Long-Term Debt\nLong-term debt, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs, comprises the following:\nBook Value Outstanding\nas of May 31,\nScheduled Maturity (Dollars and Yen in millions)\nOriginal\nPrincipal\nInterest\nRate\nInterest\nPayments\nCorporate Bond Payables:(1)(2)\nMay 1, 2023\n$\n2.25\n%\nSemi-Annually\n$\n$\nNovember 1, 2026\n$\n1,000\n2.38\n%\nSemi-Annually\nMay 1, 2043\n$\n3.63\n%\nSemi-Annually\nNovember 1, 2045\n$\n1,000\n3.88\n%\nSemi-Annually\nNovember 1, 2046\n$\n3.38\n%\nSemi-Annually\nJapanese Yen Notes:(3)\nAugust 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020\n\u00a5\n9,000\n2.60\n%\nQuarterly\nAugust 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020\n\u00a5\n4,000\n2.00\n%\nQuarterly\nTotal\n3,474\n3,477\nLess current maturities\nTOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT\n$\n3,468\n$\n3,471\n(1)\nThese senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Companys other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.\n(2)\nThe bonds are redeemable at the Companys option up to three months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2023 and 2026, and up to six months prior to the scheduled maturity date for the bonds maturing in 2043, 2045 and 2046, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. Within three and six months to scheduled maturity, respectively, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\n(3)\nNIKE Logistics YK assumed a total of \u00a513.0 billion in loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution center in Japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. These loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period August 20, 2001 through November 20, 2020.\nThe scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2019 through 2023 are $6 million, $6 million, $3 million, $0 million and $500 million, respectively, at face value.\nThe Companys Long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums, discounts and debt issuance costs. The fair value of Long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Companys Long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $3,294 million at May 31, 2018 and $3,401 million at May 31, 2017.\nNOTE 9 - Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes is as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nIncome before income taxes:\nUnited States\n$\n$\n1,240\n$\nForeign\n3,581\n3,646\n3,667\nTOTAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n$\n4,325\n$\n4,886\n$\n4,623\nThe provision for income taxes is as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nCurrent:\nUnited States\nFederal\n$\n1,167\n$\n$\nState\nForeign\nTotal\n1,745\nDeferred:\nUnited States\nFederal\n(279\n)\n(57\n)\nState\n(9\n)\n(16\n)\nForeign\n(7\n)\nTotal\n(273\n)\n(80\n)\nTOTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n$\n2,392\n$\n$\nOn December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act, which significantly changes previous U.S. tax laws, including provisions for a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as other changes. Under U.S. GAAP, accounting for the effect of tax legislation is required in the period of enactment. For fiscal 2018, the change in the corporate tax rate, effective January 1, 2018, results in a blended U.S. federal statutory rate for the Company of approximately 29%. The Tax Act also includes provisions not yet effective for the Company, including a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of foreign subsidiaries, which will be effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.\nA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\nFederal income tax rate\n29.2\n%\n35.0\n%\n35.0\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n1.2\n%\n1.1\n%\n1.1\n%\nForeign earnings\n-18.4\n%\n-20.7\n%\n-18.2\n%\nTransition tax related to the Tax Act\n43.3\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nRemeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the Tax Act\n3.7\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nExcess tax benefits from share-based compensation\n-5.3\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nResolution of a U.S. tax matter\n-\n%\n-3.2\n%\n-\n%\nOther, net\n1.6\n%\n1.0\n%\n0.8\n%\nEFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE\n55.3\n%\n13.2\n%\n18.7\n%\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2018 was higher than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 primarily due to the enactment of the Tax Act, which included provisional expense of $1,875 million for the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, and $158 million due to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The remaining provisions of the Tax Act, which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate, did not have a material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements during fiscal 2018. Additionally, the increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the tax benefit from share-based compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. During the years ended May 31, 2017 and 2016, income tax benefits of $177 million and $281 million, respectively, attributable to employee share-based compensation were allocated to Total shareholders equity. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09, beginning in fiscal 2018, income tax benefits from share-based compensation are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2017 was 550 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for the year ended May 31, 2016 primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the United States.\nIn accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), the provisional amounts recorded represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which the analysis is not yet complete. As the Company completes its analysis of the Tax Act, including collecting, preparing and analyzing necessary information, performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the IRS, U.S. Treasury Department, FASB or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the Tax Act, it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts, which may be material. In accordance with SAB 118, the Companys accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. At May 31, 2018, there were no provisions for which the Company was unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact.\nTransition Tax\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional expense of $2,010 million related to the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of further analysis of the provisions of the Tax Act and additional guidance, this provisional tax expense decreased by $135 million. The transition tax is based on the Companys estimated total post-1986 undistributed foreign earnings at a tax rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other specified assets, and 8% on the remaining earnings. The Company expects to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period. Accordingly, the non-current portion of the provisional expense for the transition tax of $1,078 million, net of applicable foreign tax credits the Company expects to utilize, has been recorded in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nImpact of Changes in the Tax Rate\nAs a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to be realized. The total provisional expense recorded during the period for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities was $158 million.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities comprise the following:\nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventories\n$\n$\nSales return reserves\nDeferred compensation\nStock-based compensation\nReserves and accrued liabilities\nNet operating loss carry-forwards\nForeign tax credit carry-forwards\n-\nUndistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n-\nOther\nTotal deferred tax assets\n1,452\nValuation allowance\n(95\n)\n(82\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets after valuation allowance\n1,370\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nForeign withholding tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries\n(155\n)\n-\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(167\n)\n(254\n)\nIntangibles\n(77\n)\n(90\n)\nOther\n(26\n)\n(2\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(425\n)\n(346\n)\nNET DEFERRED TAX ASSET\n$\n$\n1,024\nThe following is a reconciliation of the changes in the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits:\nAs of May 31,\n(In millions)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, beginning of the period\n$\n$\n$\nGross increases related to prior period tax positions\nGross decreases related to prior period tax positions\n(12\n)\n(163\n)\n(20\n)\nGross increases related to current period tax positions\nSettlements\n-\n(12\n)\n(13\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(20\n)\n(21\n)\n(17\n)\nChanges due to currency translation\n(12\n)\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, END OF THE PERIOD\n$\n$\n$\nAs of May 31, 2018, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $698 million, $478 million of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized in future periods.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. The liability for payment of interest and penalties decreased by $14 million during the year ended May 31, 2018, decreased by $38 million during the year ended May 31, 2017 and increased by $45 million during the year ended May 31, 2016. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $157 million and $171 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit).\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2014, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. The Company is currently under audit by the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and 2016.\nThe Companys major foreign jurisdictions, China and the Netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2007 and fiscal 2012, respectively. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $163 million within the next 12 months.\nThe Company historically provided for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2017, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which United States income taxes had not been provided were approximately $12.2 billion. These undistributed foreign earnings were subject to the U.S. one-time mandatory transition tax and are eligible to be repatriated to the U.S. without additional U.S. tax under the Tax Act. The Company has reevaluated its historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\nA portion of the Companys foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021. This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday was $126 million, $187 million and $173 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.08, $0.11 and $0.10 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDeferred tax assets at May 31, 2018 and 2017 were reduced by a valuation allowance primarily relating to tax benefits of certain entities with operating losses. There was a $13 million net increase in the valuation allowance for the year ended May 31, 2018, compared to a $30 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2017 and $43 million net increase for the year ended May 31, 2016.\nThe Company no longer has recorded deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carry-forwards; the $208 million recorded at May 31, 2017 was fully utilized to offset the impacts of transition tax.\nThe Company has available domestic and foreign loss carry-forwards of $289 million at May 31, 2018. Such losses will expire as follows:\nYear Ending May 31,\n(In millions)\n2023-2039\nIndefinite\nTotal\nNet operating losses\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nNOTE 10 - Redeemable Preferred Stock\nSojitz America is the sole owner of the Companys authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par value aggregating $0.3 million. A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31 and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights, but does have the right to vote as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or on the sale or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check preferred stock. The Companys articles of incorporation do not permit the issuance of additional preferred stock.\nNOTE 11 - Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation\nThe authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Companys Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders\u2018 equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.\nThe NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the Stock Incentive Plan) provides for the issuance of up to 718 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance-based awards. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan. The committee has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. Substantially all stock option grants outstanding under the Stock Incentive Plan are granted in the first quarter of each fiscal year, vest ratably over four years and expire ten years from the date of grant.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nStock options(1)\n$\n$\n$\nESPPs\nRestricted stock\nTOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n$\n$\n$\n(1)\nExpense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. Accelerated stock option expense is recorded for employees eligible for accelerated stock option vesting upon retirement. Accelerated stock option expense was $18 million, $14 million and $30 million for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAs of May 31, 2018, the Company had $195 million of unrecognized compensation costs from stock options, net of estimated forfeitures, to be recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, over a weighted average remaining period of 2.0 years.\nThe weighted average fair value per share of the options granted during the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $9.82, $9.38 and $12.66, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values are as follows:\nYear Ended May 31,\nDividend yield\n1.2\n%\n1.1\n%\n1.0\n%\nExpected volatility\n16.4\n%\n17.4\n%\n23.6\n%\nWeighted average expected life (in years)\n6.0\n6.0\n5.8\nRisk-free interest rate\n2.0\n%\n1.3\n%\n1.7\n%\nThe Company estimates the expected volatility based on the implied volatility in market traded options on the Companys common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.\nThe following summarizes the stock option transactions under the plan discussed above:\nShares(1)\nWeighted Average\nOption Price\n(In millions)\nOptions outstanding May 31, 2015\n116.2\n$\n23.50\nExercised\n(22.5\n)\n17.75\nForfeited\n(2.3\n)\n39.96\nGranted\n20.6\n56.41\nOptions outstanding May 31, 2016\n112.0\n30.38\nExercised\n(17.1\n)\n20.42\nForfeited\n(2.3\n)\n49.47\nGranted\n12.2\n57.81\nOptions outstanding May 31, 2017\n104.8\n34.79\nExercised\n(24.1\n)\n25.07\nForfeited\n(4.3\n)\n55.31\nGranted\n16.8\n59.08\nOptions outstanding May 31, 2018\n93.2\n$\n40.73\nOptions exercisable at May 31,\n66.5\n$\n21.48\n67.9\n26.03\n58.5\n31.60\n(1)\nIncludes stock appreciation rights transactions.\nThe weighted average contractual life remaining for options outstanding and options exercisable at May 31, 2018 was 5.7 years and 4.4 years, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable at May 31, 2018 was $2,896 million and $2,352 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value was the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of the options. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $889 million, $594 million and $946 million, respectively.\nIn addition to the Stock Incentive Plan, the Company gives employees the right to purchase shares at a discount to the market price under employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs). Subject to the annual statutory limit, employees are eligible to participate through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. At the end of each six-month offering period, shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the offering period. Employees purchased 3.1 million, 3.1 million and 2.5 million shares during each of the three years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units to key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares underlying such awards granted to employees during the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were 1.8 million, 0.4 million and 1.0 million, respectively, with weighted average values per share of $62.51, $57.59 and $54.87, respectively. Recipients of restricted stock are entitled to cash dividends and to vote their respective shares throughout the period of restriction. Recipients of restricted stock units are entitled to dividend equivalent cash payments upon vesting. The value of all grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units was established by the market price on the date of grant. During the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested was $113 million, $60 million and $49 million, respectively, determined as of the date of vesting. As of May 31, 2018, the Company had $104 million of unrecognized compensation costs from restricted stock and restricted stock units to be recognized in Operating overhead expense over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.\nNOTE 12 - Earnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per common share to diluted earnings per common share. The computations of diluted earnings per common share excluded options, including shares under employee stock purchase plans, to purchase an additional 42.9 million, 30.5 million and 0.2 million shares of common stock outstanding for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because the options were anti-dilutive.\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions, except per share data)\nDetermination of shares:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n1,623.8\n1,657.8\n1,697.9\nAssumed conversion of dilutive stock options and awards\n35.3\n34.2\n44.6\nDILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING\n1,659.1\n1,692.0\n1,742.5\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic\n$\n1.19\n$\n2.56\n$\n2.21\nDiluted\n$\n1.17\n$\n2.51\n$\n2.16\nNOTE 13 - Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a qualified 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, in which all U.S. employees are able to participate. The Company matches a portion of employee contributions to the savings plan. Company contributions to the savings plan were $80 million, $75 million and $72 million and included in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The terms of the plan also allow for annual discretionary profit sharing contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, to the accounts of eligible U.S. employees who work at least 1,000 hours in a year. Profit sharing contributions of $59 million, $68 million and $64 million were made to the plan and included in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company also has a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by shareholders in September 1997 and later amended and approved in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2012. The Company recognized $33 million, $21 million and $85 million of Operating overhead expense related to cash awards under the LTIP during the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe Company allows certain highly compensated employees and non-employee directors of the Company to defer compensation under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan liabilities were $641 million and $569 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities.\nThe Company has pension plans in various countries worldwide. The pension plans are only available to local employees and are generally government mandated. The liability related to the unfunded pension liabilities of the plans was $70 million and $107 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and primarily classified as non-current in Deferred income taxes and other liabilities.\nNOTE 14 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, were as follows:\n(In millions)\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustment(1)\nCash Flow Hedges\nNet Investment Hedges(1)\nOther\nTotal\nBalance at May 31, 2017\n$\n(191\n)\n$\n(52\n)\n$\n$\n(85\n)\n$\n(213\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nOther comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications(2)\n(6\n)\n(52\n)\n-\n(56\n)\nReclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses(3)\n-\n-\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n(6\n)\n-\nReclassifications to retained earnings in accordance with ASU 2018-02(4)\n(7\n)\n-\n-\nBalance at May 31, 2018\n$\n(173\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(51\n)\n$\n(92\n)\n(1)\nThe accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity.\n(2)\nNet of tax benefit (expense) of $(24) million, $(3) million, $0 million, $(4) million and $(31) million, respectively.\n(3)\nNet of tax (benefit) expense of $0 million, $(3) million, $0 million, $0 million and $(3) million, respectively.\n(4)\nRefer to Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information on the adoption of ASU 2018-02 during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\n(In millions)\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustment(1)\nCash Flow Hedges\nNet Investment Hedges(1)\nOther\nTotal\nBalance at May 31, 2016\n$\n(207\n)\n$\n$\n$\n(53\n)\n$\nOther comprehensive income (loss):\nOther comprehensive gains (losses) before reclassifications(2)\n-\n(14\n)\nReclassifications to net income of previously deferred (gains) losses(3)\n(633\n)\n-\n(18\n)\n(650\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n(515\n)\n-\n(32\n)\n(531\n)\nBalance at May 31, 2017\n$\n(191\n)\n$\n(52\n)\n$\n$\n(85\n)\n$\n(213\n)\n(1)\nThe accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment and net investment hedge gains/losses related to an investment in a foreign subsidiary are reclassified to Net income upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the respective entity.\n(2)\nNet of tax benefit (expense) of $0 million, $24 million, $0 million, $3 million and $27 million, respectively.\n(3)\nNet of tax (benefit) expense of $0 million, $(3) million, $0 million, $(3) million and $(6) million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the reclassifications from Accumulated other comprehensive income to the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nGains (losses) on foreign currency translation adjustment\n$\n-\n$\n(1\n)\nOther expense (income), net\nTotal before tax\n-\n(1\n)\nTax (expense) benefit\n-\n-\nGain (loss) net of tax\n-\n(1\n)\nGains (losses) on cash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange forwards and options\nRevenues\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(90\n)\nCost of sales\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n-\nTotal selling and administrative expense\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(69\n)\nOther expense (income), net\nInterest rate swaps\n(7\n)\n(4\n)\nInterest expense (income), net\nTotal before tax\n(131\n)\nTax (expense) benefit\nGain (loss) net of tax\n(128\n)\nGains (losses) on other\n(32\n)\nOther expense (income), net\nTotal before tax\n(32\n)\nTax (expense) benefit\n-\nGain (loss) net of tax\n(32\n)\nTotal net gain (loss) reclassified for the period\n$\n(160\n)\n$\nRefer to Note 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives for more information on the Companys risk management program and derivatives.\nNOTE 15 - Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets under operating leases expiring from 1 to 17 years after May 31, 2018. Rent expense, excluding executory costs, was $820 million, $731 million and $661 million for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

These letters of credit were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantees of the Companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Companys financial position or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. While the Company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the Company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nNOTE 16 - Risk Management and Derivatives\nThe Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions.\nThe majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2018 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date.\nThe following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2018 and 2017:\nDerivative Assets\nDerivative Liabilities\n(In millions)\nBalance Sheet\nLocation\nBalance Sheet\nLocation\nDerivatives formally designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forwards and options\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n$\nAccrued liabilities\n$\n$\nForeign exchange forwards and options\nDeferred income taxes and other assets\nDeferred income taxes and other liabilities\n-\nTotal derivatives formally designated as hedging instruments\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forwards and options\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nAccrued liabilities\nEmbedded derivatives\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\nAccrued liabilities\nForeign exchange forwards and options\nDeferred income taxes and other assets\n-\nDeferred income taxes and other liabilities\n-\nEmbedded derivatives\nDeferred income taxes and other assets\nDeferred income taxes and other liabilities\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nTOTAL DERIVATIVES\n$\n$\n$\n$\nThe following tables present the amounts affecting the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n(In millions)\nAmount of Gain (Loss)\nRecognized in Other\nComprehensive Income\non Derivatives(1)\nAmount of Gain (Loss)\nReclassified from Accumulated\nOther Comprehensive Income into Income(1)\nYear Ended May 31,\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Reclassified From\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income into Income\nYear Ended May 31,\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges:\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n$\n$\n$\nRevenues\n$\n$\n$\n(88\n)\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(50\n)\n(57\n)\nCost of sales\n(90\n)\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(4\n)\n-\nTotal selling and administrative expense\n-\n-\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(19\n)\n(25\n)\nOther expense (income), net\n(69\n)\nInterest rate swaps(2)\n-\n(54\n)\n(83\n)\nInterest expense (income), net\n(7\n)\n(4\n)\n-\nTotal designated cash flow hedges\n$\n(49\n)\n$\n$\n(75\n)\n$\n(131\n)\n$\n$\n(1)\nFor the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the amounts recorded in Other expense (income), net as a result of hedge ineffectiveness and the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring were immaterial.\n(2)\nGains and losses associated with terminated interest rate swaps, which were previously designated as cash flow hedges and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, will be released through Interest expense (income), net over the term of the issued debt.\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in\nIncome on Derivatives\nLocation of Gain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income on Derivatives\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges:\nInterest rate swaps(1)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nInterest expense (income), net\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange forwards and options\n(57\n)\n(44\n)\n(68\n)\nOther expense (income), net\nEmbedded derivatives\n$\n(4\n)\n$\n(2\n)\n$\n(2\n)\nOther expense (income), net\n(1)\nAll interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. Refer to Fair Value Hedges in this note for additional detail.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAll changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified within the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, is recorded immediately in earnings. Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be discontinued when it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period. The gains and losses associated with discontinued derivative instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in Other expense (income), net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the Company will account for the derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below.\nThe purpose of the Companys foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.\nProduct cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. NIKE entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the Companys existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, the Companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. For the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the Company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. For all currencies within the indices, excluding the U.S. Dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order. Embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the Embedded Derivatives section below.\nThe Companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $12.2 billion as of May 31, 2018.\nAs of May 31, 2018, $96 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2018, the maximum term over which the Company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2018.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts, if any, are recorded immediately in earnings. The Company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2018.\nUndesignated Derivative Instruments\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and/or the embedded derivative contracts. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net, together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position and/or embedded derivative contract. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $6.1 billion as of May 31, 2018.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nAs part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of NIKEs purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the U.S. Dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. In addition, embedded derivative contracts are created when the Company enters into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. Embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other expense (income), net, through the date the foreign currency fluctuations cease to exist.\nAt May 31, 2018, the total notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $260 million.\nCredit Risk\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\nThe Companys derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Companys bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had no derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position. Accordingly, the Company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as of May 31, 2018, the Company had received $23 million of cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer to Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements). The Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial.\nNOTE 17 - Operating Segments and Related Information\nThe Companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the Companys internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.\nEach NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. In June 2017, NIKE, Inc. announced a new company alignment designed to allow NIKE to better serve the consumer personally, at scale. As a result of this organizational realignment, the Companys reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa; Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America, and include results for the NIKE, Jordan and Hurley brands. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2018 presentation. This includes reclassified operating segment data to reflect the changes in the Companys operating structure, which became effective June 1, 2017. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or statements of shareholders equity.\nThe Companys NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.\nGlobal Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions primarily represents NIKE Brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE Brand.\nCorporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAs part of the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Companys geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Companys centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and, therefore, are provided below. Additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.\nYear Ended May 31,\n(In millions)\nREVENUES\nNorth America\n$\n14,855\n$\n15,216\n$\n14,764\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\n9,242\n7,970\n7,568\nGreater China\n5,134\n4,237\n3,785\nAsia Pacific & Latin America\n5,166\n4,737\n4,317\nGlobal Brand Divisions\nTotal NIKE Brand\n34,485\n32,233\n30,507\nConverse\n1,886\n2,042\n1,955\nCorporate\n(86\n)\nTOTAL NIKE, INC.

Revenues derived in the United States were $15,314 million, $15,778 million and $15,304 million for the years ended May 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Companys largest concentrations of long-lived assets primarily consist of the Companys world headquarters and distribution facilities in the United States and distribution facilities in Belgium, China and Japan. Long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, which are primarily composed of net property, plant & equipment, were $2,930 million and $2,629 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Long-lived assets attributable to operations in Belgium were $534 million and $390 million at May 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere has been no change of accountants nor any disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure required to be reported under this Item. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nWe carry out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of May 31, 2018.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in Item 8 of this Report.\nWe have continued several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems. These are long-term initiatives, which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes. We will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout the transformation.\nThere have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. Other Information\nOn July 20, 2018, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of NIKE, Inc. (the Company), approved a form of discretionary performance award agreement (the DPA) to enable the Company to award cash incentives to employees in recognition of Company and individual performance. The form of DPA is intended to enhance the Companys ability to pay for performance on a case-by-case basis by supplementing the Companys existing performance-based compensation plans, including the Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and the Executive Performance Sharing Plan. The foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of DPA, which is filed as Exhibit 10.22 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.\nAdditionally, on July 20, 2018, the Committee approved awards under the form of DPA to the Companys continuing named executive officers (collectively, the Officers) as follows: Mark G. Parker, $1,295,000; Andrew Campion, $277,500; Eric D. Sprunk, $277,500; Hilary K. Krane, $185,000; and John F. Slusher, $185,000. As further described in the Companys 2018 Proxy Statement, the Committee adjusted the payouts for LTIP awards covering the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period to primarily account for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because the terms of the LTIP awards, as applicable to the Company's named executive officers, did not contemplate the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Committee determined to award these one-time DPA grants so as to put the Officers in the same position as the non-executive officer LTIP participants.\nPART III ITEM 10.
