    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nItem 1.-Business is an outline of our strategy and our businesses by SBU, including key financial drivers. Additional items that may have an impact on our businesses are discussed in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.-Risk Factors include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Associated with our Operations\nThe operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks.\nWe are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:\nchanges in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, vandalism, cyber-attacks or other similar occurrences; and\nchanges in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.\nOur businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity.\nIn addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago and may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants requires periodic upgrading, improvement or repair and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts, due to disruption of the supply chain or other factors, may impact the ability of our plants to perform. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans, and specific programs supported by quality control systems, which may not prevent the occurrence and impact of these risks.\nIn addition, our battery storage operations also involve risks associated with lithium-ion batteries. On rare occasions, lithium-ion batteries can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion batteries. While more recent design developments for our storage projects seek to minimize the impact of such events, these events are inherent risks of our battery storage operations.\n59 | 2022 Annual Report\nThe hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties.\nFurthermore, we and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3.- Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurance that the outcomes of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.\nWe do a significant amount of business outside the U.S., including in developing countries.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated in developing countries and we intend to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES or its customers have an existing presence. International operations, particularly in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including:\neconomic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;\nadverse changes in currency exchange rates;\ngovernment restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;\nhigh inflation and monetary fluctuations;\nrestrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials;\nthreatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;\nunexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;\nunexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;\nfailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or other applicable anti-bribery regulations;\nunwillingness of governments, agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor contracts;\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to AES and less beneficial to government or private party counterparties, against those counterparties;\ninability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;\nadverse changes in government tax policy and tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;\ndifficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions; and\ninability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nDeveloping projects in less developed economies also entails greater financing risks and such financing may only be available from multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies that require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. There can be no assurance that project financing will be available or that, once secured, will provide similar terms or flexibility as would be expected from a commercial lender.\nFurther, our operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations, which may increase the uncertainty of cash flows from these businesses.\nAny of these factors could have a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets.\nSome of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels that differ from their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or\n60 | 2022 Annual Report\nthermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.\nVolatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:\nplant availability in the markets generally;\navailability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;\ncompetition and new entrants;\nseasonality, hydrology and other weather conditions;\nilliquid markets;\ntransmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;\nrenewables source contribution to the supply stack;\nincreased adoption of distributed generation;\nenergy efficiency and demand side resources;\navailable supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;\ngenerating unit performance;\nnatural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, pandemics and other catastrophic events;\nenergy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;\ngeneral economic conditions that impact demand and energy consumption; and\nbidding behavior and market bidding rules.\nWholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth.\nThe wholesale prices offered for electricity have been volatile in the markets in which we operate due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has decreased substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs, while only operating during certain periods of time (daylight) or weather conditions (higher winds). This, combined with changes in oil, gas, and coal pricing, has led to increasingly volatile electricity markets across our markets. Also, in many markets, new PPAs have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than those awarded just a few years ago.\nThis trend of volatility in wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell or buy power into the spot market to serve our contracts or will seek to sell power into the spot market once our contracts expire.\nAdverse economic developments in China could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our markets.\nThe Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. Many of these commodities are produced in our key electricity markets. After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, Chinas economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant slowdown in recent years. U.S. tariffs have also had a negative impact on China's economic growth. Further, China's Zero COVID strategy contributed to a significant decrease in GDP growth in 2022. The impact of the recent loosening of that strategy is uncertain at this time. Continued slowing in Chinas economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may not have adequate risk mitigation or insurance coverage for liabilities.\nPower generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Furthermore,\n61 | 2022 Annual Report\nthrough AGIC, AES captive insurance company, we take certain insurance risk on our businesses. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance it will be sufficient or effective in light of all circumstances, hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. Certain insurers have also withdrawn from insuring hydroelectric assets. We cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the amounts or on terms similar to our current policies. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not adequately covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results.\nMany of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.\nWe have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations; however, many of our customers do not have or have not maintained, investment-grade credit ratings. Our generation businesses cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government may not have an investment grade credit rating. We have also located our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective.\nOur renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties.\nWind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future. In particular, in the U.S., AES renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy generation projects, including investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AES is unable to use them, there could be a material adverse impact on AES U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lower prices in future PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Commerces investigation into the antidumping and countervailing duties circumvention claim on solar cells and panels supplied from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia has reached a preliminary determination that circumvention occurred. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically\n62 | 2022 Annual Report\nidentified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations could be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023.\nIf the final determinations result in additional taxes, tariffs, duties, or other assessments on renewable energy or the equipment necessary to generate or deliver it, such as antidumping and countervailing duty rates, such developments could impede the realization of our U.S. renewables strategy by resulting in, among other items, lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of our U.S. renewable energy projects, abandoning the development of certain U.S. renewable energy projects, a loss of our investments in the projects, and/or reduced project returns.\nFurthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.\nAs a result, these types of projects face considerable risk, including that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. At the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop or obtain third-party financing for these projects.\nFurther, in the U.S., the tax credits associated with certain renewables projects are earned when the project is placed in service. Delays in executing our renewables projects can result in delays in recognizing those tax credits and adversely impact our short-term financial results.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.\nWe are in various stages of developing and constructing renewables projects and power plants. Certain of these projects have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion of the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, interconnection and transmission, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, supply chain related disruptions to our access to materials, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. Objections of or challenges by local communities or interest groups may delay or impede permitting for our development projects.\nIn certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though they have not yet secured financing, PPAs, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment without having financing, a PPA or critical permits in place (or enter into a PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without agreed financing).\nIf the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may retain certain liabilities. Furthermore, we may undertake significant development costs and subsequently not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will reach commercial operation. If development efforts are not successful, we may abandon certain projects, resulting in, writing off the costs incurred, expensing related capitalized development costs incurred and incurring additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.\nOur acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nAcquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy historically and more recently as we grow our renewables business. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we may have limited or no history of owning and operating certain of these businesses, and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. We also may encounter challenges in integrating and realizing the expected benefits of these acquisitions as well as integration or other one-time costs that are greater\n63 | 2022 Annual Report\nthan expected. Such businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; and the rate of return from such businesses may not justify our investment of capital to acquire them. In addition, some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership or that we will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or the future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could impact our business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity in recent years, including electricity and energy consumption. COVID-19 or another pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors:\nfurther decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity;\nfurther destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting customers ability to pay for our services when due or at all, including downstream impacts, whereby the utilities customers are unable to pay monthly bills or receiving a moratorium from payment obligations, resulting in inability on the part of utilities to make payments for power supplied by our generation companies;\ndecline in business activity causing our commercial and industrial customers to experience declining revenues and liquidity difficulties that impede their ability to pay for power that we supply;\ngovernment moratoriums or other regulatory or legislative actions that limit changes in pricing, delay or suspend customers payment obligations or permit extended payment terms applicable to customers of our utilities or to our offtakers under power purchase agreements, in particular, to the extent that such measures are not mitigated by associated government subsidies or other support to address any shortfall or deficiencies in payments;\nclaims by our PPA counterparties for delay or relief from payment obligations or other adjustments, including claims based on force majeure or other legal grounds;\nfurther decline in spot electricity prices;\nthe destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth in our service territories at our utilities;\nnegative impacts on the health of our essential personnel and on our operations as a result of implementing stay-at-home, quarantine, curfew and other social distancing measures;\ndelays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel to our generation facilities due to restrictions on business operations or other factors affecting us and our third-party suppliers;\ndelays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned maintenance or disruptions in supply chain, which can, in turn, lead to disruption in operations;\na deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to the work-from-home environment;\nfurther delays to our construction projects, including at our renewables projects, and the timing of the completion of renewables projects;\ndelay or inability to receive the necessary permits for our development projects due to delays or shutdowns of government operations;\ndelays in achieving our financial goals, strategy and digital transformation;\ndeterioration of the credit profile of The AES Corporation and/or its subsidiaries and difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis;\ndelays or inability to complete asset sales on anticipated terms or to redeploy capital as set forth in our capital allocation plans;\nincreased volatility in foreign exchange and commodity markets;\ndeterioration of economic conditions, demand and other related factors resulting in impairments to long-lived assets; and\n64 | 2022 Annual Report\ndelay or inability in obtaining regulatory actions and outcomes that could be material to our business, including for recovery of COVID-19 related losses and the review and approval of our rates at our U.S. regulated utilities.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic also depends on factors, including the effectiveness and timing of updated vaccines to address new variants, the development of more virulent COVID-19 variants as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. A resurgence or material worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic could present material uncertainty that could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, development projects, energy storage sales by Fluence, and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten many of the other risks described in this section.\nCompetition is increasing and could adversely affect us.\nThe power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or intend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nSupplier and/or customer concentration may expose us to significant financial credit or performance risks.\nWe often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders. Further, our suppliers may source certain materials from areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause delays and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations.\nThe financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. At times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in Puerto Rico. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, and may have to sell power at market prices. A counterparty's breach by of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including the affected businesses debt agreements. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may incur significant expenditures to adapt to our businesses to technological changes.\nEmerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. Technological changes that could impact our businesses include:\n65 | 2022 Annual Report\ntechnologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar projects), and energy storage technology;\nadvances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation or impact our customers performance of long-term agreements; and\nmore cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.\nEmerging technologies may also allow new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or disintermediate the services we provide our customers, including traditional utility and centralized generation services. If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.\nOur business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. In particular, there has been an increased focus on the U.S. energy grid believed to be related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach may:\nimpact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships;\nexpose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings;\nrequire extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks;\nimpair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities; and\nimpact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.\nWe have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers. We cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyber-attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience. Further, we do not control certain of joint ventures or our equity method investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be effective.\nCertain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.\nOur businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. In addition,\n66 | 2022 Annual Report\nwe are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.\nTo the extent that hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, such as has happened in Panama in 2019 and Brazil in 2021, our results of operations can be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate at anticipated levels and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology.\nSevere weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in North America or reduced water availability and increased flooding across Central and South America, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change.\nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Such incidents may also impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers.\nA disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. At our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.\nWe do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures or our equity method investments.\nWe have invested in some joint ventures in which our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders.\nThe approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the decisions we would make and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, if a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to or share of liabilities for the joint venture, we may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.\n67 | 2022 Annual Report\nFurther, we have a significant equity method investment in Fluence. As a publicly listed company, Fluence is governed by its own Board of Directors, whose members have fiduciary duties to the Fluence shareholders. While we have certain rights to appoint representatives to the Fluence Board of Directors, the interests of the Fluence shareholders, as represented by the Fluence Board of Directors, may not align with our interests or the interests of our securityholders. As of December 31, 2022, Fluence continues to report that a material weakness in its internal control over revenue recognition and related inventory has not yet been remediated. Such material weakness can impact the reliability of the Fluence financial information that we may include as part of our financial information.\nIn addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position.\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our foreign subsidiaries report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our foreign operations expenses are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.\nWe routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk,\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default. For our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.\nOur utilities businesses may experience slower growth in customers or in customer usage.\nCustomer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by external factors, including mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic\n68 | 2022 Annual Report\nconditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity may cause us to not realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.\nWe have 28 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in a material increase in pension expense and future funding requirements. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan, which may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect our and our subsidiaries' liquidity. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 15-Benefit Plans included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nImpairment of long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nLong-lived assets are initially recorded at cost or fair value, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, and are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators are present, such as deterioration in general economic conditions or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower forecasted revenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly costs that we are unable to pass through to customers; increase in environmental compliance costs; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; developments in our strategy; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. Any impairment of long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws\nOur operations are subject to significant government regulation and could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.\nOur ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including obtaining expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including:\nchanges in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;\nchanges in the determination of an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a rate reduction or consumer rebates;\nchanges in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;\nchanges in tax law;\nchanges in law or regulation that limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us;\n69 | 2022 Annual Report\nchanges in environmental law that impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities;\nchanges in the definition of events that qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;\nchanges in the timing of tariff increases;\nother changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;\nother changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or\nother changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the our markets.\nFurthermore, in many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. The impacts described above could also result from our efforts to comply with European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of the above events may result in lower operating margins and financial results for the affected businesses.\nSeveral of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR.\nCCR generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled by: placement in onsite CCR ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. CCR currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in CCR ponds. The EPA's final CCR rule provides that enforcement actions can be commenced by the EPA, states, or territories, and private lawsuits. Compliance with the U.S. federal CCR rule; amendments to the federal CCR rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing CCR may require us to incur substantial costs. In addition, the Company and our businesses may face CCR-related lawsuits in the United States and/or internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. Furthermore, CCR-related litigation may also expose us to unexpected costs. In addition, CCR, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and local media attention. The direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may divert management time and attention. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.\nSome of our U.S. businesses are subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered by FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions that can have a material effect on our operations.\nThe AES Corporation is a registered electric holding company under the PUHCA 2005 as enacted as part of the EPAct 2005. PUHCA 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, while continuing to provide FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. PUHCA 2005 also creates additional potential challenges and opportunities. By removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likely. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S.\nOther parts of the EPAct 2005 allow FERC to remove the PURPA purchase/sale obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. FERC has exercised this power with a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO, PJM, ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. Additionally, FERC has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our QFs that have had sales contracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other AES QFs with existing contracts that will expire over time.\nFERC strongly encourages competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of generation assets. Similarly, FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission\n70 | 2022 Annual Report\ninfrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.\nFERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.\nPursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the ERO to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Violations of NERC reliability standards are subject to FERC's penalty authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005.\nOur U.S. utility businesses face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1.-Business-US and Utilities SBU.\nOur businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.\nOur businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. For example, in recent years, the EPA has issued NOVs to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available control technology. The primary focus of these NOVs has been emissions of SO2 and NOx and the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. In addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units.\nFurthermore, Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. See Item 1.-Business-Environmental and Land-Use Regulations.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected.\n71 | 2022 Annual Report\nConcerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.\nInternational, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate GHG emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them. In 2022, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total CO2 emissions of approximately 40 million metric tonnes, approximately 15 million of which were emitted by our U.S. businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. This estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. While actual emissions may vary substantially; the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions.\nThere currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO2) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled electric utility steam generating units larger than 25 MW and in 2018 proposed revisions to the rule. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which establishes heat rate improvement measures as the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded to the EPA the ACE Rule, but withheld issuance of the mandate that would effectuate its decision. On February 22, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA's unopposed motion for a partial stay of the issuance of the mandate on vacating the repeal of the CPP. On March 5, 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued the partial mandate effectuating the vacatur of the ACE Rule. In effect, the CPP did not take effect while the EPA is addressing the remand of the ACE rule by promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule to regulate greenhouse gases from existing electric generating units. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted petitions to review the decision by the D.C. Circuit to vacate the ACE Rule. On June 30, 2022, Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded for further proceedings consistent with its opinion. The opinion held that the generation shifting approach in the CPP exceeded the authority granted to EPA by Congress under Section 111(d) of the CAA. As a result of the June 30, 2022 Supreme Court decision, on October 27, 2022, the D.C. Circuit recalled its March 5, 2021 partial mandate and issued a new partial mandate holding pending challenges to the ACE Rule in abeyance while EPA develops a replacement rule. The impact of the results of further proceedings and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material. The impact of the results of such litigation and potential future greenhouse gas emissions regulations remains uncertain, but it could be material.\nIn 2010, the EPA adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such permitting would only be required if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants. For further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions, see Item 1.-Business-Environmental and Land-Use Regulations-U.S. Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations-Greenhouse Gas Emissions above. The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to decarbonize the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions. The impact of GHG regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. The costs of compliance could be substantial.\nOur non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties. Likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or\n72 | 2022 Annual Report\ncustomers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly.\nFurthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, and changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power transmission and distribution assets and facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenues. In addition, while revenues would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity.\nIn addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile, Hawaii, and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives, including developments in our strategy in line with these initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.\nIn addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits that were dismissed against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. Future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. We may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. See Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results within this section for more information. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation.\nConcerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identifiable information about customers, employees, customer energy usage and other information as well as information regarding business partners and other third parties, some of which may constitute confidential information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data collected by us can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. Although we maintain technical and organizational measures to protect personal identifiable information and other confidential information, breaches of, or disruptions to, our information technology systems could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to various data privacy and security laws and regulations globally, as well as contractual requirements, as a result of having access to and processing confidential and personal identifiable information in the course of business. If we are unable to comply with applicable laws and regulations or with our contractual commitments, as well as maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, any actual or perceived failure on the part of one of our equity affiliates could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and prospects.\n73 | 2022 Annual Report\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect us.\nWe operate in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions and are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely impact our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes, our effective tax rate or tax payments. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (the IRA) was signed into law in the United States. The IRA includes provisions that are expected to benefit the U.S. clean energy industry, including increases, extensions and/or new tax credits for onshore and offshore wind, solar, storage and hydrogen projects. We expect that the extension of the current solar investment tax credits (\"ITCs\"), as well as higher credits available for projects that satisfy wage and apprenticeship requirements, will increase demand for our renewables products. In the U.S., the IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income. We are currently evaluating the applicability and effect of the new law and additional guidance issued in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWith respect to international tax reform, in the fourth quarter of 2022, the European Commission adopted an amended Directive on Pillar 2 establishing a global minimum tax at a 15% rate. The adoption requires EU Member States to transpose the Directive into their respective national laws by December 31, 2023, for the rules to come into effect as of January 1, 2024. We will continue to monitor issuance of draft legislation in Bulgaria and other relevant EU Member States. The Impact to the Company remains unknown but may be material.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Financial Condition\nWe have a significant amount of debt.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $23 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings under The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility are unsecured. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries, however, is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. A substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on our debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This level of indebtedness and related security could have other consequences, including:\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\nlimiting, along with financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements may be greater than expected and our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due. In that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at that time. Any refinancing of our debt could result in higher interest rates or more onerous covenants that restrict our business operations. See Note 11-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.Our subsidiaries face various\n74 | 2022 Annual Report\nrestrictions in their ability to distribute cash. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.\nExisting and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect us.\nWe attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects through non-recourse debt or \"non-recourse financing\" that requires the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $23 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.9 billion was recourse debt of the Parent Company and approximately $19.4 billion was non-recourse debt. In some non-recourse financings, the Parent Company has explicitly agreed, in the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $177 million as of December 31, 2022. While the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, such defaults under non-recourse financings can:\nreduce the Parent Company's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash because a subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the pendency of any default;\ntrigger The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;\ntrigger defaults in the Parent Company's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries and relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or\nresult in foreclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse financings, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.\nNone of the projects that are in default are owned by subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, meet the applicable standard of materiality in The AES Corporation's revolving credit facility or other debt agreements to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other changes to our financial position and results of operations, one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of Parent Company indebtedness.\nThe AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.\nThe AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund: principal repayments of debt, interest, dividends on our common stock, acquisitions, construction and other project commitments, other equity commitments (including business development investments); equity repurchases; taxes and Parent Company overhead costs. Our principal sources of liquidity are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, proceeds from financings at the Parent Company, and proceeds from asset sales. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis -Capital Resources and Liquidity. We believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations for the foreseeable future, based on a number of material assumptions about access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions; however, there can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay our debt obligations at maturity and we may have to refinance such\n75 | 2022 Annual Report\nobligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on acceptable terms.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.\nWe rely on the capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic and capital market conditions; the availability of bank credit; the availability of tax equity partners; the financial condition, performance and prospects of AES as well as our competitors; and changes in tax and securities laws. Should access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or cease further investments, including the expansion or improvement of existing facilities, any of which would affect our future growth.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the capital markets, interest expense, liquidity or cash flow.\nIf any of the credit ratings of the The AES Corporation and its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. Furthermore, counterparties may no longer be willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, we may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation, which reduces our available credit. There can be no assurance that counterparties will accept such guarantees or other assurances.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to factors including general economic conditions, conditions in our industry and our markets, environmental and economic developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as well as developments specific to us, including risks described in this section, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or key trends and other matters described in Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe maintain offices in many places around the world, generally pursuant to the provisions of long- and short-term leases, none of which we believe are material. With a few exceptions, our facilities, which are described in Item 1 - Business of this Form 10-K, are subject to mortgages or other liens or encumbrances as part of the project's related finance facility. In addition, the majority of our facilities are located on land that is leased. However, in a few instances, no accompanying project financing exists for the facility, and in a few of these cases, the land interest may not be subject to any encumbrance and is owned outright by the subsidiary or affiliate. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company has accrued for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes, based upon information it currently possesses and taking into account established reserves for estimated liabilities and its insurance coverage, that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and actions is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible, however, that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2022.\nIn December 2001, Grid Corporation of Odisha (GRIDCO) served a notice to arbitrate pursuant to the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996 on the Company, AES Orissa Distribution Private Limited (AES ODPL), and Jyoti Structures (Jyoti) pursuant to the terms of the shareholders agreement between GRIDCO, the Company, AES ODPL, Jyoti and the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa Ltd. (CESCO), an affiliate of the Company. In the arbitration, GRIDCO asserted that a comfort letter issued by the Company in connection with the Company's indirect investment in CESCO obligates the Company to provide additional financial support to cover all of CESCO's financial obligations to GRIDCO. GRIDCO appeared to be seeking approximately $189 million in damages, plus\n76 | 2022 Annual Report\nundisclosed penalties and interest, but a detailed alleged damage analysis was not filed by GRIDCO. The Company counterclaimed against GRIDCO for damages. In June 2007, a 2-to-1 majority of the arbitral tribunal rendered its award rejecting GRIDCO's claims and holding that none of the respondents, the Company, AES ODPL, or Jyoti, had any liability to GRIDCO. The respondents' counterclaims were also rejected. A majority of the tribunal later awarded the respondents, including the Company, some of their costs relating to the arbitration. GRIDCO filed challenges of the tribunal's awards with the local Indian court. GRIDCO's challenge of the costs award has been dismissed by the court, but its challenge of the liability award remains pending. A hearing on the liability award has not taken place to date. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nPursuant to their environmental audit, AES Sul and AES Florestal discovered 200 barrels of solid creosote waste and other contaminants at a pole factory that AES Florestal had been operating. The conclusion of the audit was that a prior operator of the pole factory, Companhia Estadual de Energia (CEEE), had been using those contaminants to treat the poles that were manufactured at the factory. On their initiative, AES Sul and AES Florestal communicated with Brazilian authorities and CEEE about the adoption of containment and remediation measures. In March 2008, the State Attorney of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil filed a public civil action against AES Sul, AES Florestal and CEEE seeking an order requiring the companies to mitigate the contaminated area located on the grounds of the pole factory and an indemnity payment of approximately R$6 million ($1 million). In October 2011, the State Attorney filed a request for an injunction ordering the defendant companies to contain and remove the contamination immediately. The court granted injunctive relief on October 18, 2011, but determined that only CEEE was required to perform the removal work. In May 2012, CEEE began the removal work in compliance with the injunction. The case is now awaiting judgment. The removal and remediation costs are estimated to be approximately R$15 million to R$60 million ($3 million to $11 million), and there could be additional costs which cannot be estimated at this time. In June 2016, the Company sold AES Sul to CPFL Energia S.A. and as part of the sale, AES Guaiba, a holding company of AES Sul, retained the potential liability relating to this matter. The Company believes that there are meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nIn September 2015, AES Southland Development, LLC and AES Redondo Beach, LLC filed a lawsuit against the California Coastal Commission (the CCC) over the CCC's determination that the site of AES Redondo Beach included approximately 5.93 acres of CCC-jurisdictional wetlands. The CCC has asserted that AES Redondo Beach has improperly installed and operated water pumps affecting the alleged wetlands in violation of the California Coastal Act and Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program. Potential outcomes of the CCC determination could include an order requiring AES Redondo Beach to perform a restoration and/or pay fines or penalties. AES Redondo Beach believes that it has meritorious arguments concerning the underlying CCC determination, but there can be no assurances that it will be successful. On March 27, 2020, AES Redondo Beach, LLC sold the site to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser that assumed the obligations contained within these proceedings. On May 26, 2020, CCC staff sent AES a NOV directing AES to submit a Coastal Development Permit (CDP) application for the removal of the water pumps within the alleged wetlands. AES has submitted the CDP to the permitting authority, the City of Redondo Beach (the City), with respect to AES plans to disable or remove the pumps. The NOV also directed AES to submit technical analysis regarding additional water pumps located within onsite electrical vaults and a CDP application for their continued operation. AES has responded to the CCC, providing the requested analysis and seeking further discussion with the agency regarding the CDP. On October 14, 2020, the City deemed the CDP application to be complete and indicated a public hearing will be required, at which time AES must present additional information and analysis on the pumps within the alleged wetlands and the onsite electrical vaults.\nIn October 2015, AES Indiana received an NOV alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Indiana State Implementation Plan (SIP), and the Title V operating permit related to alleged particulate and opacity violations at Petersburg Station Unit 3. In addition, in February 2016, AES Indiana received an NOV from the EPA alleging violations of New Source Review and other CAA regulations, the Indiana SIP, and the Title V operating permit at Petersburg Station. On August 31, 2020, AES Indiana reached a settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), resolving these purported violations of the CAA at Petersburg Station. The settlement agreement, in the form of a proposed judicial consent decree, was approved and entered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on March 23, 2021, and includes, among other items, the following requirements: annual caps on NOx and SO2 emissions and more stringent emissions limits than AES Indiana's current Title V air permit; payment of civil penalties totaling $1.5 million; a $5 million environmental mitigation project consisting of the construction and operation of a new, non-emitting source of generation at the site; expenditure of $0.3 million on a state-only environmentally beneficial project to preserve\n77 | 2022 Annual Report\nlocal, ecologically-significant lands; and retirement of Units 1 and 2 prior to July 1, 2023. If AES Indiana does not meet the retirement obligation, it must install a Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction System (\"SNCR\") on Unit 4.\nIn October 2017, the Maritime Prosecution Office from Valpara\u00edso issued a ruling alleging responsibility by AES Andes for the presence of coal waste on Ventanas beach, and proposed a fine before the Maritime Governor, of approximately $395,000. AES Andes submitted its statement of defense, denying the allegations. In May 2021, AES Andes was notified of an amended Opinion of the Maritime Prosecution Office which extends the alleged liability to a third party and reduces the proposed fine to AES Andes to approximately $372,000. On August 18, the Maritime Governor issued a resolution affirming the proposed fine, and on September 8, AES Andes filed an administrative action with the Maritime Governor requesting reconsideration of the fine. On December 28, 2021 the resolution rejecting the reinstatement appeal was notified and on January 17, 2022 AES Andes filed an appeal against that ruling. In April 2022, Puerto Ventanas requested that the Maritime Authority join this proceeding with a parallel proceeding; however, the request was rejected. In May 2022, the General Director of the Maritime Territory and Merchant Marine of the Chilean Navy rejected AES Andes appeal and imposed a fine of $341,363. AES Andes will continue with administrative appeals. AES Andes believes that it has meritorious defenses to the allegations; however, there are no assurances it will be successful.\nIn December 2018, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, and three other AES affiliates. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 100 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands $476 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.\nIn February 2019, a separate lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company, AES Puerto Rico, two other AES affiliates, and an unaffiliated company and its principal. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 200 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $900 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify, or provide any supporting information concerning, the alleged injuries of the claimants individually, nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. In August 2020, at the request of the relevant AES companies, the case was transferred to a different civil court. Preliminary hearings have taken place and are ongoing. The relevant AES companies believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against them and will defend themselves vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that they will be successful in their efforts.\nIn October 2019, the Superintendency of the Environment (the \"SMA\") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the environmental permit of the Ventanas Complex, initiating a sanctioning process through Exempt Resolution N\u00b0 1 / ROL D-129-2019. The alleged charges include exceeding generation limits, failing to reduce emissions during episodes of poor air quality, exceeding limits on discharges to the sea, and exceeding noise limits. AES Andes has submitted a proposed Compliance Program to the SMA for the Ventanas Complex. The latest version of this Compliance Program was submitted on May 26, 2021. On December 30, 2021, the Compliance Program was approved by the SMA. However an ex officio action was brought by the SMA due to alleged exceedances of generation limits, which would require the Company to reduce SO2, NOx and PM emissions in order to achieve the emissions offset established in the Compliance Program. On January 6, 2022, AES Andes filed a reposition with the SMA seeking modification of the means for compliance with the ex officio action. On January 17, 2023, the SMA approved street paving measures, or alternatively a program providing heaters for community members, as the means to satisfy the air emissions offsets in the approved Compliance Plan. Fines are possible if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of the Compliance Program. The cost of proposed Compliance Program is approximately $10.8 million.\nIn March 2020, Mexicos Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE) served an arbitration demand upon AES M\u00e9rida III. CFE makes allegations that AES M\u00e9rida III is in breach of its obligations under a power and capacity purchase agreement (Contract) between the two parties, which allegations related to CFEs own failure to provide fuel within the specifications of the Contract. CFE seeks to recover approximately $200 million in payments made to AES M\u00e9rida under the Contract as well as approximately $480 million in alleged damages for having to acquire\n78 | 2022 Annual Report\npower from alternative sources in the Yucatan Peninsula. AES M\u00e9rida has filed an answer denying liability to CFE and asserting a counterclaim for damages due to CFEs breach of its obligations. The parties submitted their respective initial briefs and supporting evidence in December 2020. After additional briefing, the evidentiary hearing took place in November 2021. Closing arguments were heard in May 2022. In November 2022, the arbitration Tribunal issued its decision in the case, rejecting CFEs claims for damages and granting AES M\u00e9rida a net amount of damages on AES M\u00e9ridas counterclaims. It is unclear whether CFE will comply with the decision or will attempt to challenge it. AES M\u00e9rida believes that it has meritorious defenses and claims and will assert them vigorously in this dispute; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nOn May 12, 2021, the Mexican Federal Attorney for Environmental Protection (the Authority) initiated an environmental audit at the Termoelectrica del Golfo (TEG) and Termoelectrica del Pe\u00f1oles (TEP) thermal generating facilities. On July 15, 2022, TEG was notified of the resolution issued by the Authority, which alleges breaches of air emission regulations, including failure to submit reports. The resolution imposes a fine of $8,467,360 pesos (approximately USD $400,000). The facility filed a nullity judgment to challenge the resolution, and on September 8, 2022, a provisional injunction was granted by the Tribunal, subject to TEGs presentation of a warranty, which could include a corporate guaranty or bail. The provisional injunction temporarily suspends the obligation to pay the fine while the Tribunal considers a definitive injunction, and potentially, a sentence dismissing the fine. On December 2, 2022, TEG presented a bail as guarantee for the injunction, which was rejected by the local tax authority. TEG challenged the tax authority's denial through an amparo claim on January 10, 2023. No resolution for TEPs audit has been issued, and on September 9, 2022, TEP filed an amparo claim challenging the inaction of the Authority on the environmental audit. The amparo claim was admitted on October 17, 2022. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nIn February 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Dominican Republic civil court against the Company. The lawsuit purports to be brought on behalf of over 425 Dominican claimants, living and deceased, and appears to seek relief relating to CCRs that were delivered to the Dominican Republic in 2003 and 2004. The lawsuit generally alleges that the CCRs caused personal injuries and deaths and demands over $600 million in alleged damages. The lawsuit does not identify or provide any supporting information concerning the alleged injuries of the claimants individually. Nor does the lawsuit provide any information supporting the demand for damages or explaining how the quantum was derived. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it and will defend itself vigorously in this proceeding; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nOn July 25, 2022, AES Puerto Rico, LP (AES-PR) received from the EPA an NOV alleging certain violations of the CAA at AES-PRs coal-fired power facility in Guayama, Puerto Rico. The NOV alleges AES-PR exceeded an emission limit and did not continuously operate certain monitoring equipment, conduct certain analyses and testing, maintain complete records, and submit certain reports as required by the EPAs Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The NOV further alleges AES-PR did not comply fully with the facilitys Title V operating permit. AES-PR is engaging in discussions with the EPA about the NOV. AES-PR will defend its interests, but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time. However, settlements and litigated outcomes of CAA claims alleged against other coal-fired power plants have required companies to pay civil penalties and undertake remedial measures.\nIn April 2022, the Superintendency of the Environment (the \"SMA\") notified AES Andes of certain alleged breaches associated with the construction of the Mesam\u00e1vida wind project, initiating a sanctioning process. The alleged charges include untimely implementation of road improvement measures and road use schedules and the failure to identify all noise receptors closest to the first construction phases of the project. On June 23, 2022, the SMA addressed the charges to Energ\u00eda E\u00f3lica Mesam\u00e1vida SpA. On June 28, 2022, Energ\u00eda E\u00f3lica Mesam\u00e1vida SpA submitted a proposed compliance program, with an estimated cost of $4.3 million, which was subsequently approved by the SMA. On November 9, 2022, opponents to the project submitted before the Third Environmental Court a judicial action challenging the approval of this compliance program. If the third-party appeal is successful or if the SMA determines there is an unsatisfactory execution of this compliance program, fines are possible. AES Andes believes that it has meritorious defenses to the third-party challenge and will defend itself vigorously in these proceedings; however, there can be no assurances that it will be successful in its efforts.\nIn September 2022, the SMA initiated sanctioning proceedings against the Cochrane Power Station on four alleged charges, including one instance of noncompliance categorized as serious with the Environmental Qualification Resolution (RCA). The allegations included structural and monitoring deficiencies, as well as an unauthorized underwater outfall discharging from the facility. On December 12, 2022, AES Andes submitted a\n79 | 2022 Annual Report\nproposed compliance program to the SMA, with an estimated cost of approximately $340,000, which is currently under review. Fines are possible if the SMA does not approve the compliance program or if the SMA determines that the compliance program was not executed to its satisfaction.\nOn January 26, 2023, the SMA notified Alto Maipo SpA of four alleged charges relating to the Alto Maipo facility, all which are categorized by the SMA as serious. The alleged charges include untimely completion of intake works and insufficient capture by the provisional works, irrigation water outlet and canal contemplated by an agreement with local communities; non-compliance with the details of the forest management plans and intervention in unauthorized areas; construction of a road in a restricted paleontological area; and unlawful moving of fauna. The Alto Maipo project intends to submit a compliance program for consideration by the SMA. The costs of any such compliance program are uncertain. If a compliance program is not agreed or executed to the satisfaction of the SMA , fines, revocation of the facilitys RCA environmental permit approved by the SMA, or closure are possible outcomes for such alleged serious violations under applicable regulations.

Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, bad debt expense and recoveries, and general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel.\nOperating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales.\n85 | 2022 Annual Report\nConsolidated Revenue and Operating Margin\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021\nRevenue\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Revenue - Revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 13%, in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by:\n$711 million at MCAC driven by favorable LNG transactions in Panama and the Dominican Republic; higher contract sales due to increased demand and higher prices in the Dominican Republic; higher spot sales due to better hydrology in Panama; and higher pass-through fuel costs in Mexico; partially offset by the impact from the sale of Itabo in April 2021;\n$678 million at US and Utilities driven by higher prices at AES Indiana and AES Ohio due to increases in riders to collect fuel and purchased power costs from customers, as well as increased demand and favorable weather; higher sales at AES Clean Energy due to the supply agreement with Google, the prior year acquisition of New York Wind and the commencement of renewable projects; higher spot sales at Southland; and higher pass-through energy prices in El Salvador; partially offset by an increase in unrealized derivative losses at Southland and Southland Energy and a decrease at AES Hawaii due to closure of the plant in August 2022; and\n$94 million at Eurasia mainly driven by higher energy prices and generation in Bulgaria, higher electricity prices at St. Nikola, and recognition of construction revenue at Mong Duong due to a reduction in expected completion costs for ash pond 2; partially offset by unfavorable FX impact.\nOperating Margin\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Operating Margin - Operating margin decreased $163 million, or 6%, in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by:\n86 | 2022 Annual Report\n$246 million at South America primarily driven by revenue recognized at Angamos in the prior year for the early termination of contracts with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; an increase in regulatory receivable credit loss allowances in Argentina; higher energy purchases and higher fixed costs at AES Brasil; and unfavorable FX impact; partially offset by higher generation, lower depreciation of coal assets, and lower spot purchases in Chile; higher contract sales at AES Brasil due to better hydrology; higher energy prices in Colombia; and higher availability at TermoAndes; and\n$228 million at US and Utilities mainly driven by an increase in unrealized derivative losses at Southland Energy; recognition of previously deferred purchased power costs at AES Ohio and a charge resulting from a regulatory settlement at AES Indiana; the impact from outages and closure of the plant at AES Hawaii; lower availability and higher maintenance costs at AES Puerto Rico due to forced outages and a higher heat rate; and an increase in costs associated with growing the business at AES Clean Energy; partially offset by higher retail margin at AES Indiana due to higher volumes from favorable weather; and higher sales at AES Clean Energy due to the supply agreement with Google, the prior year acquisition of New York Wind, and the commencement of renewables projects.\nThese unfavorable impacts were partially offset by increases of:\n$299 million at MCAC primarily driven by an increase in Panama and the Dominican Republic due to favorable LNG transactions; higher contract sales due to higher prices and favorable hydrology in Panama and increased demand and higher prices in the Dominican Republic; partially offset by the impact from the sale of Itabo in April 2021; and\n$20 million at Eurasia mainly driven by recognition of construction revenue at Mong Duong due to a reduction in expected completion costs for ash pond 2; and by higher electricity prices at St. Nikola in Bulgaria; partially offset by unfavorable FX impact and higher maintenance costs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nRevenue\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Revenue - Revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 15%, in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by:\n$417 million at US and Utilities driven by higher sales at Southland Energy primarily due to the CCGT units operating under active PPAs during the full 2021 period; higher demand in El Salvador due to the economic recovery from the COVID-19 impact; higher fuel revenues and higher demand from favorable weather at AES Indiana; increases in capacity sales and in realized gains resulting from the commercial hedging strategy at Southland; and higher sales at AES Clean Energy due to the supply agreement with Google; partially offset by decreased capacity at DPL due to its exit from the generation business;\n$391 million at MCAC driven by higher contract sales, fuel prices, and LNG sales, driven by the Eastern Pipeline COD in 2020, in the Dominican Republic; higher pass-through fuel prices in Mexico; and higher energy prices and contract sales due to increased demand in Panama; partially offset by the impact from the sale of Itabo in April 2021;\n$382 million at South America primarily driven by the revenue recognized at Angamos for the early termination of contracts with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; higher generation and prices (Resolution 440/2021) in Argentina; higher availability, from higher reservoir levels, in Colombia; and higher\n87 | 2022 Annual Report\nvolume and generation at AES Brasil, partially due to the acquisition of Ventus and Cubico I; partially offset by unfavorable FX impact and by the prior period recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile; and\n$295 million at Eurasia mainly driven by higher energy prices and generation in Bulgaria and higher generation in Vietnam.\nOperating Margin\n(in millions)\nConsolidated Operating Margin - Operating margin increased $18 million, or 1%, in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by:\n$154 million at US and Utilities primarily from higher sales at Southland Energy due to the CCGT units operating under active PPAs during the full 2021 period; increases in capacity sales and in realized gains resulting from the commercial hedging strategy at Southland; and higher demand in El Salvador due to the economic recovery from the COVID-19 impact; partially offset by increased costs associated with growing and accelerating the development pipeline at AES Clean Energy and by higher maintenance expenses at AES Indiana;\n$46 million at Corporate and Other, mainly eliminated at the consolidated level, driven by increases in IT costs reallocated to the operating segments and premiums earned by the AES self-insurance company; and\n$30 million at Eurasia mainly driven by higher energy prices and generation in Bulgaria and improved operational performance in Vietnam.\nThese favorable impacts were partially offset by decreases of:\n$174 million at South America primarily due to unfavorable FX impact; higher energy purchases due to drier hydrology and a prior period GSF settlement at Tiet\u00ea; and higher spot prices on energy prices and prior period recovery of previously expensed payments from customers in Chile; partially offset by revenue recognized at Angamos for the early termination of contracts with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; higher generation and prices (Resolution 440/2021) in Argentina; lower fixed costs in Chile; and higher availability from higher reservoir levels in Colombia; and\n$38 million at MCAC mainly driven by the impact from the sale of Itabo in April 2021; decreased capacity and higher fixed costs in the Dominican Republic; decreased availability and higher fixed costs in Mexico; and higher fuel costs, drier hydrology, and the disconnection of the Estrella del Mar I power barge in the prior year in Panama; partially offset by higher LNG sales in the Dominican Republic driven by the Eastern Pipeline COD in 2020 and higher demand and positive impact from new renewables businesses in Panama.\nSee Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for additional discussion and analysis of operating results for each SBU.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Other\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses include expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, as well as global development costs.\n88 | 2022 Annual Report\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $41 million, or 25%, to $207 million in 2022 compared to $166 million in 2021, primarily due to increased business development activity and people costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1 million, or 1%, to $166 million in 2021 compared to $165 million in 2020, with no material drivers.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense increased $206 million, or 23%, to $1.1 billion in 2022, compared to $911 million in 2021, primarily due to the prior year impact of realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, lower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile, and increased borrowings in South America and at the Parent Company.\nInterest expense decreased $127 million, or 12%, to $911 million in 2021, compared to $1 billion in 2020, primarily due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, lower interest rates related to refinancing at the Parent Company, and lower monetary correction due to the GSF settlement in March 2021.\nInterest income\nInterest income increased $91 million, or 31%, to $389 million in 2022, compared to $298 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in short-term investments at AES Brasil and Argentina, higher CAMMESA interest rates on receivables in Argentina, and increase in sales-type lease receivables at the Alamitos Energy Center.\nInterest income increased $30 million, or 11%, to $298 million in 2021, compared to $268 million in 2020 primarily due to the arbitration proceeding in Chile, the commencement of a sales-type lease at the Alamitos Energy Center in January 2021, and higher CAMMESA interest rates on receivables in Argentina, partially offset by a lower loan receivable balance in Vietnam.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt decreased $63 million, or 81%, to $15 million in 2022, compared to $78 million in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the prior year losses of $27 million due to the prepayment at AES Brasil, at AES Argentina and AES Andes of $17 million and $14 million, respectively, due to repayments, and a refinancing resulting in a $14 million loss at Andres, partially offset in 2022 by a refinancing resulting in a loss of $12 million at AES Renewable Holdings.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt decreased $108 million, or 58% to $78 million in 2021, compared to $186 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to losses in 2020 of $145 million and $34 million at the Parent Company and DPL, respectively, resulting from the redemption of senior notes and a $16 million loss resulting from the Panama refinancing. These decreases were partially offset in 2021 by the losses mentioned above.\nSee Note 11-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\nOther income\nOther income decreased $308 million to $102 million in 2022, compared to $410 million in 2021 primarily due to the prior year gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to its acquisition-date fair value, recognized as part of the merger to form AES Clean Energy Development, prior year legal arbitration at Alto Maipo, and the prior year gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration at AES Clean Energy; partially offset by the current year gain on remeasurement of our existing investment in 5B, which is accounted for using the measurement alternative, and insurance proceeds primarily associated with property damage at TermoAndes.\nOther income increased $335 million to $410 million in 2021, compared to $75 million in 2020 primarily due to the 2021 gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to its acquisition-date fair value, recognized as part of the merger to form AES Clean Energy Development, legal arbitration at Alto Maipo, and the gain on remeasurement of contingent consideration of the Great Cove Solar acquisition at AES Clean Energy, partially offset by the 2020 gain on sale of Redondo Beach land at Southland.\nOther expense\nOther expense increased $8 million, or 13%, to $68 million in 2022, compared to $60 million in 2021, primarily due to current year costs related to the disposition of AES Gilbert, including the recognition of an allowance on the sales-type lease receivable; partially offset by lower losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases due to the prior year loss at AES Renewable Holdings.\n89 | 2022 Annual Report\nOther expense increased $7 million, or 13% to $60 million in 2021, compared to $53 million in 2020 primarily due to the 2021 loss recognized at commencement of a sales-type lease at AES Renewable Holdings and an increase in loss on sale and disposal of assets, partially offset by lower losses on sales of Stabilization Fund receivables in Chile and compliance with an arbitration decision in 2020.\nSee Note 21-Other Income and Expense included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\nLoss on disposal and sale of business interests\nLoss on disposal and sale of business interests decreased $1.7 billion to $9 million in 2022, compared to $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to the prior year $2.1 billion loss on the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, partially offset by the issuance of new shares by Fluence, our equity method investment, to new investors, which AES accounted for as a gain on the partial disposition of its investment in Fluence in 2021.\nLoss on disposal and sale of business interests increased $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in 2021, compared to $95 million in 2020, primarily due to the changes at Alto Maipo and Fluence referenced in the paragraph above.\nSee Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions and Note 8-Investments in and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\nGoodwill impairment expense\nGoodwill impairment expense was $777 million in 2022, due to a $644 million impairment at AES Andes and a $133 million impairment at AES El Salvador. This was due to the Company seeing increases in inputs utilized to derive the discount rate applied in our goodwill impairment analysis, such as higher interest rates and country risk premiums in certain markets. These changes to the inputs of our discount rate have negatively impacted our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2022. There was no goodwill impairment expense in 2021 or 2020.\nSee Note 9-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\nAsset impairment expense\nAsset impairment expense decreased $812 million to $763 million in 2022, compared to $1.6 billion in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to 2021 impairments at AES Andes totaling $804 million associated with a commitment to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 3 & 4 and Angamos coal-fired plants, a $475 million impairment at Puerto Rico associated with the economic costs and reputational risks of disposal of coal combustion residuals off island, impairments at the Buffalo Gap wind generation facilities totaling $193 million due to an expired PPA and volatile spot prices in the ERCOT market, and a $67 million impairment at the Mountain View I & II facilities related to a repowering project that will result in decommissioning the majority of the existing wind turbines in advance of their depreciable lives. This was partially offset by the $468 million impairment of Maritza's coal-fired plant due to Bulgaria's commitment to cease electricity generation using coal as a fuel source beyond 2038, the $193 million impairment at TEG TEP in Mexico, and a $76 million impairment of Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan.\nAsset impairment expense increased $711 million to $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to $864 million in 2020. This increase was primarily due to 2021 impairments at AES Andes totaling $804 million, a $475 million impairment at Puerto Rico, impairments at the Buffalo Gap wind generation facilities totaling $193 million, and a $67 million impairment at the Mountain View I & II wind facilities. This was partially offset by the $564 million and $213 million impairments related to the Angamos and Ventanas 1 & 2 coal-fired plants in Chile and the $38 million impairment of the generation facility in Hawaii during 2020.\nSee Note 22-Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\n90 | 2022 Annual Report\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses)\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) in millions were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nArgentina (1)\n$ (88) $ (21) $ 29\nChile 13 20 (5)\nCorporate - (11) 21\nDominican Republic - (1) 9\nOther (2) 3 1\nTotal (2)\n$ (77) $ (10) $ 55\n_____________________________\n(1) Includes peso-denominated energy receivable indexed to the USD through the FONINVEMEM agreement which is considered a foreign currency derivative. See Note 7-Financing Receivables included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\n(2) Includes losses of $20 million and gains of $12 million and $57 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $77 million in 2022, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso, partially offset by realized foreign currency derivative gains in South America due to the depreciating Colombian peso.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $10 million in 2021, primarily driven by the depreciation of the Argentine peso, unrealized losses on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina, and unrealized losses at the Parent Company resulting from the depreciation of intercompany receivables denominated in Euro, partially offset by unrealized derivative gains on foreign currency derivatives due to the depreciating Colombian peso.\nThe Company recognized net foreign currency transaction gains of $55 million in 2020, primarily driven by realized and unrealized gains on foreign currency derivatives related to government receivables in Argentina and unrealized gains at the Parent Company resulting from the appreciation of intercompany receivables denominated in Euro.\nOther non-operating expense\nOther non-operating expense was $175 million in 2022 due to the other-than-temporary impairment of the sPower equity method investment. The impairment analysis was triggered by the signing of a purchase and sale agreement which, at the time, implied an expected loss upon sale of the Company's indirect interest in a portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\"). The transaction closed on February 28, 2023. sPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity partners. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity. Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities following the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of the operating assets. See Note 25-Acquisitions included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the formation of AES Clean Energy Development.\nThere was no other non-operating expense in 2021.\nOther non-operating expense was $202 million in 2020 due to the other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment. In December 2019, an other-than-temporary impairment was recorded for OPGC primarily due to the estimated market value of the Company's investment and other negative developments impacting future expected cash flows at the investee. In March 2020, the Company recognized an additional $43 million other-than-temporary impairment due to the economic slowdown. In June 2020, the Company agreed to sell its entire stake in the OPGC investment, resulting in an other-than-temporary impairment of $158 million.\nSee Note 8-Investments In and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\nIncome tax expense was $265 million in 2022, compared to income tax benefit of $133 million in 2021. The Company's effective tax rates were (157)% and 13% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n91 | 2022 Annual Report\nThe 2022 effective tax rate was impacted by the current year nondeductible goodwill impairments at AES Andes and AES El Salvador, as well as the current year asset impairment of the Maritza coal-fired plant. These impacts were partially offset by favorable LNG transactions at certain MCAC businesses and inflationary and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses recognized in 2022. The 2021 effective tax rate was impacted by the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo and the asset impairment at Puerto Rico. These impacts were partially offset by the income tax benefit related to effective settlement resulting from the exam closure of the Companys U.S. 2017 tax return. Additionally offsetting the 2021 impacts was the benefit associated with the release of valuation allowance due to a change in expected realizability of net operating loss carryforwards at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries. See Note 9-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the goodwill impairments. See Note 22-Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the asset impairments. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo.\nIncome tax benefit was $133 million in 2021, compared to income tax expense of $216 million in 2020. The Company's effective tax rates were 13% and 44% for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the 2021 impacts of the drivers cited above. Further, the 2020 effective tax rate was impacted by the other-than-temporary impairment of the OPGC equity method investment and the loss on sale of the Companys entire interest in AES Uruguaiana, partially offset by the recognition of a federal ITC for the Na Pua Makani wind facility in Hawaii. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for details of the sale of the Company's entire interest of AES Uruguaiana.\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the U.S., which are generally taxed at rates different than the U.S. statutory rate. Foreign earnings may be taxed at rates higher than the U.S. corporate rate of 21% and are also subject to current U.S. taxation under the GILTI rule. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. See Note 23-Income Taxes included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these reduced rates.\nNet equity in losses of affiliates\nNet equity in losses of affiliates increased $47 million to $71 million in 2022, compared to $24 million in 2021. This was primarily driven by lower earnings of $31 million from sPower, mainly due to lower earnings from renewable projects that came online and higher losses on extinguishment of debt, partially offset by lower impairment expense; and by an increase in losses of $22 million from Fluence mainly due to an increase in costs, including share-based compensation, associated with the growing business.\nNet equity in losses of affiliates decreased $99 million, or 80%, to $24 million in 2021, compared to $123 million in 2020. This was primarily driven by earnings from sPower in 2021 of $79 million, compared to losses in 2020, driven by renewable projects that came online and impairments of certain development projects in 2020, and $81 million of losses from AES Andes in 2020 mainly due to a long-lived asset impairment and the suspension of equity method accounting at Guacolda. This decrease in losses was partially offset by higher losses of $45 million from Fluence due to shipping issues, cost overruns and delays at projects under construction, and an increase in costs associated with the growing business, as well as higher losses of $10 million from Uplight due to higher costs associated with the growing business.\nSee Note 8-Investments In and Advances to Affiliates included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information.\n92 | 2022 Annual Report\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries increased $583 million to $41 million in 2022, compared to a loss of $542 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to:\nPrior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nPrior year asset impairments at Buffalo Gap; and\nLower allocation of losses to tax equity partners at AES Renewable Holdings.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nHigher allocation of losses to tax equity partners and increased costs associated with growing the business at AES Clean Energy Development;\nLower earnings from AES Andes due to increased AES ownership from 67% to 99% in the first quarter of 2022;\nPrior year deferred tax benefits recorded at AES Brasil; and\nAsset impairments at Amman East and IPP4 in Jordan.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries decreased $648 million to a loss of $542 million in 2021, compared to income of $106 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to:\nLoss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nAsset impairments at Buffalo Gap;\nIncreased costs associated with growing the business at AES Clean Energy Development;\nLower earnings in Brazil due to the 2020 favorable revision of the GSF liability; and\nLower earnings in the Dominican Republic due to the sale of Itabo in the second quarter of 2021.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nAllocation of earnings at Southland Energy to noncontrolling interests;\nHigher earnings in Panama primarily due to the 2020 asset impairment and loss on extinguishment of debt; and\nHigher earnings in Colombia due to the life extension project at the Chivor hydroelectric plant completed in 2020 and better hydrology.\nNet income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation\nNet loss attributable to The AES Corporation increased $137 million, or 33%, to $546 million in 2022, compared to $409 million in 2021. This increase was primarily due to:\nHigher goodwill impairments in the current year;\nPrior year gain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nHigher income tax expense;\nPrior year gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition date fair value;\nHigher Parent interest expense due to prior year realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps, higher interest rates, and higher outstanding debt;\nLower margins at our US and Utilities SBU due to the recognition of previously deferred power purchase costs, impacts of outages, and unrealized derivative losses;\nLower capitalized interest at construction projects in Chile; and\nOther-than-temporary impairment of sPower.\n93 | 2022 Annual Report\nThese increases were partially offset by:\nPrior year loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nLower long-lived asset impairments in the current year; and\nHigher margins at our MCAC SBU due to favorable LNG transactions.\nNet income attributable to The AES Corporation decreased $455 million to a loss of $409 million in 2021, compared to income of $46 million in 2020. This decrease was primarily due to:\nLoss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo due to loss of control after Chapter 11 filing;\nHigher asset impairments in 2021; and\nLower margins at our South America SBU primarily due to the 2020 revision of the GSF liability at Brazil.\nThese decreases were partially offset by:\nGain due to the initial public offering of Fluence;\nGain on remeasurement of our equity interest in the sPower development platform to acquisition-date fair value;\nOther-than-temporary impairment of OPGC in 2020;\nLower Parent interest expense due to realized gains on de-designated interest rate swaps and lower interest rates;\nLosses on extinguishment of debt at the Parent Company and DPL in 2020;\nHigher margins at our US and Utilities SBU primarily due to favorable price variances under the commercial hedging strategy at Southland and at Southland Energy mainly due to the CCGT units operating under active PPAs during the full 2021 period; and\nLower income tax expense.\nSBU Performance Analysis\nSegments\nWe are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: US and Utilities (United States, Puerto Rico, and El Salvador); South America (Chile, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil); MCAC (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia).\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements such as investors, industry analysts, and lenders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company updated the definition of Adjusted EPS item (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects to include the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's 2017 U.S. tax return exam.\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company changed the definitions of Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS to remove the adjustment for costs directly associated with a major restructuring program, including, but not limited to, workforce reduction efforts, relocations, and office consolidation. As this adjustment was specific to the major restructuring program announced by the Company in 2018, we believe removing this adjustment from our non-GAAP definitions provides simplification and clarity for our investors. There were no such costs in 2020, 2021 or 2022.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company changed the definitions of Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC, and Adjusted EPS to exclude net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence which occurred in 2020, and also impacted 2021. We believe the inclusion of the effects of this non-recurring transaction would result\n94 | 2022 Annual Report\nin a lack of comparability in our results of operations and would distort the metrics that our investors use to measure us.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nWe define Adjusted Operating Margin as Operating Margin, adjusted for the impact of NCI, excluding (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions; (b) benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures; and (c) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. The allocation of HLBV earnings to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted out of Adjusted Operating Margin. See Review of Consolidated Results of Operations for definitions of Operating Margin and cost of sales.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is Operating Margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determination include the impact of NCI, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests. Adjusted Operating Margin should not be construed as an alternative to Operating Margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Adjusted Operating Margin (in millions) Years Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating Margin $ 2,548 $ 2,711 $ 2,693\nNoncontrolling interests adjustment (1)\n(473) (722) (831)\nUnrealized derivative losses (gains) 75 (28) 24\nDisposition/acquisition losses 3 11 24\nNet gains from early contract terminations at Angamos - (251) (182)\nTotal Adjusted Operating Margin $ 2,153 $ 1,721 $ 1,728\n_____________________________\n(1)The allocation of HLBV earnings to noncontrolling interests is not adjusted out of Adjusted Operating Margin.\n95 | 2022 Annual Report\nAdjusted PTC\nWe define Adjusted PTC as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities.\nAdjusted PTC reflects the impact of NCI and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in Operating Margin, Adjusted PTC includes the other components of our Consolidated Statement of Operations, such as general and administrative expenses in the Corporate segment, as well as business development costs, interest expense and interest income, other expense and other income, realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and net equity in earnings of affiliates.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation. We believe that Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, Adjusted PTC represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results.\nAdjusted PTC should not be construed as an alternative to income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of Adjusted PTC (in millions) Years Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, attributable to The AES Corporation $ (546) $ (413) $ 43\nIncome tax expense (benefit) attributable to The AES Corporation 210 (31) 130\nPre-tax contribution (336) (444) 173\nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains) 128 (1) 3\nUnrealized foreign currency losses (gains) 42 14 (10)\nDisposition/acquisition losses 40 861 112\nImpairment losses 1,658 1,153 928\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 35 91 223\nNet gains from early contract terminations at Angamos - (256) (182)\nTotal Adjusted PTC $ 1,567 $ 1,418 $ 1,247\n96 | 2022 Annual Report\nAdjusted EPS\nWe define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of both consolidated entities and entities accounted for under the equity method due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, the tax impact from the repatriation of sales proceeds, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence; and (g) tax benefit or expense related to the enactment effects of 2017 U.S. tax law reform and related regulations and any subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, including the 2021 tax benefit on reversal of uncertain tax positions effectively settled upon the closure of the Company's U.S. tax return exam.\nThe GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted EPS better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is considered in the Company's internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions or equity securities remeasurement, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments, strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, the one-time impact of the 2017 U.S. tax law reform and subsequent period adjustments related to enactment effects, and the non-recurring nature of the impact of the early contract terminations at Angamos, which affect results in a given period or periods. Adjusted EPS should not be construed as an alternative to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which is determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $0.82 and $0.62 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For purposes of measuring diluted loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted average shares as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted EPS, the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents. The table below reconciles the weighted average shares used in GAAP diluted loss per share to the weighted average shares used in calculating the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS.\n97 | 2022 Annual Report\nReconciliation of Denominator Used for Adjusted EPS Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021\n(in millions, except per share data) Loss Shares $ per Share Loss Shares $ per Share\nGAAP DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE\nLoss from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (546) 668 $ (0.82) $ (413) 666 $ (0.62)\nEFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES\nStock options - 1 - - 1 -\nRestricted stock units - 2 - - 3 -\nEquity units - 40 0.05 2 33 0.03\nNON-GAAP DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE $ (546) 711 $ (0.77) $ (411) 703 $ (0.59)\nReconciliation of Adjusted EPS Years Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (0.77) $ (0.59) $ 0.06\nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses 0.18 (1)\n- 0.01\nUnrealized foreign currency losses (gains) 0.07 (2)\n0.02 (0.01)\nDisposition/acquisition losses 0.06 (3)\n1.22 (4)\n0.17 (5)\nImpairment losses 2.33 (6)\n1.65 (7)\n1.39 (8)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 0.05 (9)\n0.13 (10)\n0.33 (11)\nNet gains from early contract terminations at Angamos - (0.37) (12)\n(0.27) (12)\nU.S. Tax Law Reform Impact - (0.25) (13)\n0.02 (14)\nLess: Net income tax benefit (0.25) (15)\n(0.29) (16)\n(0.26) (17)\nAdjusted EPS $ 1.67 $ 1.52 $ 1.44\n_____________________________\n(1)Amount primarily relates to unrealized losses on power swaps at Southland Energy of $109 million, or $0.15 per share.\n(2)Amount primarily relates to unrealized foreign currency losses in Argentina of $39 million, or $0.05 per share, mainly associated with the devaluation of long-term receivables denominated in Argentine pesos.\n(3)Amount primarily relates to costs on disposition of AES Gilbert, including the recognition of an allowance on the sales-type lease receivable, of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, and a day-one loss recognized at commencement of a sales-type lease at AES Waikoloa Solar of $5 million, or $0.01 per share.\n(4)Amount primarily relates to loss on deconsolidation of Alto Maipo of $1.5 billion, or $2.09 per share, loss on Uplight transaction with shareholders of $25 million, or $0.04 per share, and a day-one loss recognized at commencement of a sales-type lease at AES Renewable Holdings of $13 million, or $0.02 per share, partially offset by gain on initial public offering of Fluence of $325 million, or $0.46 per share, gain on remeasurement of our equity interest in sPower to acquisition-date fair value of $249 million, or $0.35 per share, gain on Fluence issuance of shares of $60 million, or $0.09 per share, and gain on sale of Guacolda of $22 million, or $0.03 per share.\n(5)Amount primarily relates to loss on sale of Uruguaiana of $85 million, or $0.13 per share, loss on sale of the Kazakhstan HPPs of $30 million, or $0.05 per share, as a result of the final arbitration decision, and advisor fees associated with the successful acquisition of additional ownership interest in AES Brasil of $9 million, or $0.01 per share;

Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses, and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may have a material impact on our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1.-Business and Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nOperational\nTrade Restrictions and Supply Chain - On March 29, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) announced the initiation of an investigation into whether imports into the U.S. of solar cells and panels imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are circumventing antidumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and panels from China. This investigation resulted in significant systemic disruptions to the import of solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia. On June 6, 2022, President Biden issued a Proclamation waiving any tariffs that result from this investigation for a 24-month period. Since President Bidens proclamation, suppliers in Southeast Asia have imported cells and panels again to the U.S.\n102 | 2022 Annual Report\nOn December 2, 2022, Commerce issued country-wide affirmative preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred in each of the four Southeast Asian countries. Commerce also evaluated numerous individual companies and issued preliminary determinations that circumvention had occurred with respect to many but not all of these companies. Additionally, Commerce issued a preliminary determination that circumvention would not be deemed to occur for any solar cells and panels imported from the four countries if the wafers were manufactured outside of China or if no more than two out of six specifically identified components were produced in China. These preliminary determinations could be modified and final determinations from Commerce are expected in May 2023. We have contracted and secured our expected requirements for solar panels for U.S. projects targeted to achieve commercial operations in 2023.\nAdditionally, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) seeks to block the import of products made with forced labor in certain areas of China and may lead to certain suppliers being blocked from importing solar cells and panels to the U.S. While this has impacted the U.S. market, AES has managed this issue without significant impact to our projects. Further disruptions may impact our suppliers ability or willingness to meet their contractual agreements or to continue to supply cells or panels into the U.S. market on terms that we deem satisfactory.\nThe impact of any adverse Commerce determination, the impact of the UFLPA, future disruptions to the solar panel supply chain and their effect on AES U.S. solar project development and construction activities are uncertain. AES will continue to monitor developments and take prudent steps towards maintaining a robust supply chain for our renewable projects.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets intermittently in the last three years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic we have conducted our essential operations without significant disruption. We derive approximately 85% of our total revenues from our regulated utilities and long-term sales and supply contracts or PPAs at our generation businesses, which contributes to a relatively stable revenue and cost structure at most of our businesses. In 2022, our operational locations continued to experience the impact of, and recovery from, the COVID-19 pandemic. Across our global portfolio, our utilities businesses have generally performed in line with our expectations consistent with a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also see Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\nEst\u00ed Hydro Plant Flooding Incident - On September 30, 2022, there was a flooding incident that impacted Est\u00ed, a 120 MW hydro plant in Panama. The plant was taken out of service for a complete assessment of the damages, which has now been completed. Repairs will be needed to ensure the long-term performance of the facility. During this time, the plant will continue to be out of service. The plant is covered by business interruption and property damage insurance and, in December 2022, a partial settlement was reached with the insurer.\nThe Company has not identified any indicators of impairment and believes the carrying value of the plant of $130 million is recoverable as of December 31, 2022.\nMacroeconomic and Political\nThe macroeconomic and political environments in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have changed during 2022. This could result in significant impacts to tax laws and environmental and energy policies. Additionally, we operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at the subsidiary level. See ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOverview Regarding Market Risks\nOur businesses are exposed to and proactively manage market risk. Our primary market risk exposure is to the price of commodities, particularly electricity, oil, natural gas, coal, and environmental credits. In addition, our businesses are exposed to lower electricity prices due to increased competition, including from renewable sources such as wind and solar, as a result of lower costs of entry and lower variable costs. We operate in multiple countries and as such are subject to volatility in exchange rates at varying degrees at the subsidiary level and between our functional currency, the USD, and currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations due to our issuance of debt and related financial instruments.\nThe disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Item 1A.-Risk Factors, Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our financial results and position; Wholesale power prices may experience significant volatility in our markets which could impact our operations and opportunities for future growth; We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates; and Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology of this 2022 Form 10-K.\nCommodity Price Risk\nAlthough we prefer to hedge our exposure to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of electricity, fuels, and environmental credits, some of our generation businesses operate under short-term sales, have contracted electricity obligations greater than supply or operate under contract sales that leave an unhedged exposure on some of our capacity or through imperfect fuel pass-throughs. These businesses subject our operational results to the volatility of prices for electricity, fuels, and environmental credits in competitive markets. We employ risk management strategies to hedge our financial performance against the effects of fluctuations in energy commodity prices. The implementation of these strategies can involve the use of physical and financial commodity contracts, futures, swaps, and options.\nThe portion of our sales and purchases that are not subject to such agreements or contracted businesses where indexation is not perfectly matched to business drivers will be exposed to commodity price risk. When hedging the output of our generation assets, we utilize contract sales that lock in the spread per MWh between variable costs and the price at which the electricity can be sold.\nAES businesses will see changes in variable margin performance as global commodity prices shift. For 2023, we project pre-tax earnings exposure on a 10% (uncorrelated) move in commodity prices to be approximately a $5 million gain for power, a $10 million loss for oil, and a $5 million loss for coal and natural gas. Our estimates exclude correlation of oil with coal or natural gas. For example, a decline in oil or natural gas prices can be accompanied by a decline in coal price if commodity prices are correlated. In aggregate, the Company's downside exposure occurs with lower power, lower oil, higher natural gas, and higher coal prices. Exposures at individual businesses will change as new contracts or financial hedges are executed, and our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices generally increases in later years with reduced hedge levels at some of our businesses.\n122 | 2022 Annual Report\nCommodity prices affect our businesses differently depending on the local market characteristics and risk management strategies. Spot power prices, contract indexation provisions, and generation costs can be directly or indirectly affected by movements in the price of natural gas, oil, and coal. We have some natural offsets across our businesses such that low commodity prices may benefit certain businesses and be a cost to others. Exposures are not perfectly linear or symmetric. The sensitivities are affected by a number of local or indirect market factors. Examples of these factors include hydrology, local energy market supply/demand balances, regional fuel supply issues, regional competition, bidding strategies, and regulatory interventions such as price caps. Operational flexibility changes the shape of our sensitivities. For instance, certain power plants may limit downside exposure by reducing dispatch in low market environments. Volume variation also affects our commodity exposure. The volume sold under contracts or retail concessions can vary based on weather and economic conditions, resulting in a higher or lower volume of sales in spot markets. Thermal unit availability and hydrology can affect the generation output available for sale and can affect the marginal unit setting power prices.\nIn the US and Utilities SBU, the generation businesses are largely contracted but may have residual risk to the extent contracts are not perfectly indexed to the business drivers. At Southland, our existing once-through cooling generation units (Legacy Assets) are permitted to operate through the end of 2023. These assets have contracts in capacity and have seen incremental value in energy revenues.\nIn the South America SBU, our business in Chile owns assets in the central and northern regions of the country and has a portfolio of contract sales in both. The significant portion of our PPAs include mechanisms of indexation that adjust the price of energy based on fluctuations in the price of coal, with the specific indices and timing varying by contract, in order to mitigate changes in the price of fuel. For the portion of our contracts not indexed to the price of coal, we have implemented a hedging strategy based on international coal financial instruments for up to 3 years. In Colombia, we operate under a shorter-term sales strategy with spot market exposure for uncontracted volumes. Because we own hydroelectric assets there, contracts are not indexed to fuel. Additionally, in Brazil, the hydroelectric generating facility is covered by contract sales. Under normal hydrological volatility, spot price risk is mitigated through a regulated sharing mechanism across all hydroelectric generators in the country. Under drier conditions, the sharing mechanism may not be sufficient to cover the business' contract position, and therefore it may have to purchase power at spot prices driven by the cost of thermal generation.\nIn the MCAC SBU, our businesses have commodity exposure on unhedged volumes. Panama is highly contracted under financial and load-following PPA type structures, exposing the business to hydrology-based variance. To the extent hydrological inflows are greater than or less than the contract volumes, the business will be sensitive to changes in spot power prices which may be driven by oil and natural gas prices in some time periods. In the Dominican Republic, we own natural gas plants contracted under a portfolio of contract sales, and both contract and spot prices may move with commodity prices. Additionally, the contract levels do not always match our generation availability and our assets may be sellers of spot prices in excess of contract levels or a net buyer in the spot market to satisfy contract obligations.\nIn the Eurasia SBU, our assets operating in Vietnam and Bulgaria have minimal exposure to commodity price risk as it has no or minor merchant exposure and fuel is subject to a pass-through mechanism.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency risk and other foreign operations risks that arise from investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. A key component of these risks stems from the fact that some of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates utilize currencies other than our consolidated reporting currency, the USD. Additionally, certain of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates have entered into monetary obligations in USD or currencies other than their own functional currencies. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries calculate and pay taxes in currencies other than their own functional currency. We have varying degrees of exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies: Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Dominican peso, Euro, and Mexican peso. Our exposure to certain of these currencies may be material. These subsidiaries and affiliates have attempted to limit potential foreign exchange exposure by entering into revenue contracts that adjust to changes in foreign exchange rates. We also use foreign currency forwards, swaps, and options where possible to manage our risk related to certain foreign currency fluctuations.\nAES enters into foreign currency hedges to protect economic value of the business and minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations to AES' portfolio. While protecting cash flows, the hedging strategy is also designed to reduce forward-looking earnings foreign exchange volatility. Due to variation of timing and amount between cash distributions and earnings exposure, the hedge impact may not fully cover the earnings exposure on\n123 | 2022 Annual Report\na realized basis, which could result in greater volatility in earnings. The largest foreign exchange risks for 2023 stem from the following currencies: Brazilian real and Euro. As of December 31, 2022, assuming a 10% USD appreciation, cash distributions attributable to foreign subsidiaries exposed to movement in the exchange rate of the Brazilian real are projected to be impacted by less than a $10 million gain, a less than $5 million gain for the Colombian peso and a less than $5 million loss for the Euro. These numbers have been produced by applying a one-time 10% USD appreciation to forecasted exposed cash distributions for 2023 coming from the respective subsidiaries exposed to the currencies listed above, net of the impact of outstanding hedges and holding all other variables constant. The numbers presented above are net of any transactional gains/losses. These sensitivities may change in the future as new hedges are executed or existing hedges are unwound. Additionally, updates to the forecasted cash distributions exposed to foreign exchange risk may result in further modification. The sensitivities presented do not capture the impacts of any administrative market restrictions or currency inconvertibility.\nInterest Rate Risks\nWe are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt, as well as interest rate swap, cap, floor, and option agreements. Decisions on the fixed-floating debt mix are made to be consistent with the risk factors faced by individual businesses or plants. Depending on whether a plant's capacity payments or revenue stream is fixed or varies with inflation, we partially hedge against interest rate fluctuations by arranging fixed-rate or variable-rate financing. In certain cases, particularly for non-recourse financing, we execute interest rate swap, cap, and floor agreements to effectively fix or limit the interest rate exposure on the underlying financing. Most of our interest rate risk is related to non-recourse financings at our businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the portfolio's pre-tax earnings exposure for 2023 to a one-time 100-basis-point increase in interest rates for our Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Chilean peso, Colombian peso, Euro, and USD denominated debt would be less than $55 million on interest expense for the debt denominated in these currencies. These amounts do not take into account the historical correlation between these interest rates.\n124 | 2022 Annual Report ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nPart A - Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nOur auditors are Ernst & Young LLP, located in Tysons, Virginia. Their PCAOB ID number is 42.\nPart B - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n125 | 2022 Annual Report\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The AES Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n126 | 2022 Annual Report\nGoodwill Impairment Test for AES Andes and AES El Salvador Reporting Units\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Companys goodwill balance was $362 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss is measured at the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units and utilized the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of these reporting units. As discussed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the estimated fair value was less than the carrying amount for both of these reporting units and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $777 million during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAuditing the Companys annual goodwill impairment tests for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units required judgment to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic and industry conditions and involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of these reporting units. In particular, the fair value estimates of the reporting units involve the use of significant unobservable inputs and are sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, such as the interest rates and country risk premiums, which are inputs used to determine the discount rates.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review and testing process for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the valuation models, the significant assumptions described above, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.\nTo test the estimated fair value for the AES Andes and AES El Salvador reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to develop the estimated fair values, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the discount rates used in the fair value estimate.\nLong-lived Asset Impairments and Re-evaluation of Useful Lives\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company's net property, plant and equipment was $23,039 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value. The Companys useful life estimates are continually evaluated for appropriateness as changes in the relevant factors arise, including when a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability. As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized a total asset impairment expense of $661 million related to the Maritza and the TEG TEP asset groups in 2022.\n127 | 2022 Annual Report\nAuditing the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives was complex and highly judgmental because of the many geographic, regulatory, and economic environments in which the Company operates. Also, due to the wide variety of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset group is not recoverable or that may result in a change in useful life, auditing the Companys identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives involved a high degree of subjectivity, particularly given the Companys decarbonization initiatives and shift towards clean energy platforms. In addition, auditing the Companys valuation of long-lived assets used in the Maritza and TEG TEP impairment analyses involved significant judgment due to the significant unobservable inputs used in the estimation of the asset groups fair value. In particular, the significant assumptions for the income approach used to determine the fair value of the asset groups included the Companys projections of revenue growth and discount rates, which are forward-looking assumptions and could be affected by future industry, market, and economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Companys controls over the identification of impairment indicators, re-evaluation of estimated useful lives, and the valuation of the Maritza and TEG TEP long-lived asset impairments. For example, we tested managements monitoring controls over the evaluation of events or changes in circumstances that would require an asset to be tested for recoverability. We also tested managements review controls of the valuation models used in the impairment analyses, the significant assumptions used to develop the estimates, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.\nTo test the Company's identification of impairment indicators and re-evaluation of useful lives, our audit procedures included, among others, making inquiries of management, including personnel in operations, to understand changes in the businesses and managements strategic plans, and evaluate whether management has considered any identified changes in their analysis. We evaluated the results of earnings and the projected cash flows for significant coal generation assets and assessed whether there has been a deterioration in earnings or projected losses that would represent an impairment indicator. We also evaluated conditions and trends in the industry for the underlying economies, including any sale or disposition activities, and evaluated any adverse changes in the regulatory environment or the geographic areas to test the completeness and accuracy of the company's evaluation of potential impairment indicators. We evaluated the Companys useful life estimates, in particular for its significant coal generation assets, considering the existing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the market for the use of these assets subsequent to the expiration of existing PPAs, based on the regulatory and market conditions.\nTo test the impairment analyses for the Maritza and TEG TEP asset groups, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the appropriateness of valuation methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends as well as historical results. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the asset groups that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall valuation methodology and the discount rates used in the fair value estimates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 1, 2023\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021\n2022 2021\n(in millions, except share and per share data)\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,374 $ 943\nRestricted cash 536 304\nShort-term investments 730 232\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $5 and $5, respectively\n1,799 1,418\nInventory 1,055 604\nPrepaid expenses 98 142\nOther current assets, net of CECL allowance of $2 and $0, respectively 1,533 897\nCurrent held-for-sale assets 518 816\nTotal current assets 7,643 5,356\nNONCURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nLand 470 426\nElectric generation, distribution assets and other 26,599 25,552\nAccumulated depreciation (8,651) (8,486)\nConstruction in progress 4,621 2,414\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 23,039 19,906\nOther Assets:\nInvestments in and advances to affiliates 952 1,080\nDebt service reserves and other deposits 177 237\nGoodwill 362 1,177\nOther intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $434 and $385, respectively\n1,841 1,450\nDeferred income taxes 319 409\nLoan receivable, net of allowance of $26\n1,051 -\nOther noncurrent assets, net of allowance of $51 and $23, respectively\n2,979 2,188\nNoncurrent held-for-sale assets -

GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company (the \"Parent Company\") that, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, (collectively, \"AES\" or \"the Company\") operates a geographically diversified portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses. Generally, the liabilities of individual operating entities are non-recourse to the Parent Company and are isolated to the operating entities. Most of our operating entities are structured as limited liability entities, which limit the liability of shareholders. The structure is generally the same regardless of whether a subsidiary is consolidated under a voting or variable interest model. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The AES Corporation and its controlled subsidiaries. Furthermore, VIEs in which the Company has an ownership interest and is the primary beneficiary, thus controlling the VIE, have been consolidated. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS - Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Additionally, net income and comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests are reflected separately from consolidated net income and comprehensive income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity. Any change in ownership of a subsidiary while the controlling financial interest is retained is accounted for as an equity transaction between the controlling and noncontrolling interests. Losses continue to be attributed to the noncontrolling interests, even when the noncontrolling interests' basis has been reduced to zero.\nEquity securities with redemption features that are not solely within the control of the issuer are classified as temporary equity and are included in Redeemable stock of subsidiaries on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Generally, initial measurement will be at fair value. The subsequent allocation of income and dividends is classified in temporary equity. Subsequent measurement and classification vary depending on whether the instrument is probable of becoming redeemable. For those securities that are currently redeemable or where it is probable that the instrument will become redeemable, AES recognizes any changes from the carrying value to redemption value at each reporting period against retained earnings or additional paid-in capital in the absence of retained earnings; such adjustments are classified in temporary equity. When the equity instrument is not probable of becoming redeemable, no adjustment to the carrying value is recognized. Instruments that are mandatorily redeemable are classified as a liability.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS - Investments in entities over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and reported in Investments in and advances to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Companys proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in Net equity in losses of affiliates on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company utilizes the cumulative earnings approach to determine whether distributions received from equity method investees are returns on investment or returns of investment. The Company discontinues the application of the equity method when an investment is reduced to zero and the Company is not otherwise committed to provide further financial support to the investee. The Company resumes the application of the equity method accounting to the extent that net income is greater than the share of net losses not previously recorded.\nUpon acquiring the investment, we determine the fair value of the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and the basis difference between each fair value and the carrying amount of the corresponding asset or liability in the financial statements of the investee. The AES share of the amortization of the basis difference is recognized in Net equity in losses of affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the life of the asset or liability.\nThe Company periodically assesses if impairment indicators exist at our equity method investments. When an impairment is observed, any excess of the carrying amount over its estimated fair value is recognized as impairment\n134 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nexpense when the loss in value is deemed other-than-temporary and included in Other non-operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nBUSINESS INTERESTS - Acquisitions and disposals of business interests are generally transactions pertaining to operational legal entities, which may be accounted for as a consolidated business, an asset, or an equity method investment. Losses on expected sales of business interests are limited to the impairment of long-lived assets as of the date of execution of the sales agreement, which are recognized in Asset impairment expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any gains/(losses) upon the completion of disposals, which include reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments, are recognized in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests in the Consolidated Statements of Operations upon completion of the sale.\nALLOCATION OF EARNINGS - Certain of the Company's businesses are subject to profit-sharing arrangements where the allocation of cash distributions and the sharing of tax benefits are not based on fixed ownership percentages. These arrangements exist for certain U.S. renewable generation partnerships to designate different allocations of value among investors, where the allocations change in form or percentage over the life of the partnership. For these businesses, the Company uses the hypothetical liquidation at book value (HLBV) method when it is a reasonable approximation of the profit-sharing arrangement. The HLBV method calculates the proceeds that would be attributable to each partner based on the liquidation provisions of the respective operating partnership agreement if the partnership was to be liquidated at book value at the balance sheet date. Each partners share of income in the period is equal to the change in the amount of net equity they are legally able to claim based on a hypothetical liquidation of the entity at the end of a reporting period compared to the beginning of that period, adjusted for any capital transactions.\nThe HLBV method is used both to allocate the equity earnings attributable to AES when the Company accounts for the renewable business as an equity method investment and to calculate the earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest when the business is consolidated by AES. In the early months of operations of a renewable generation facility where HLBV results in a significant decrease in the hypothetical liquidation proceeds attributable to the tax equity investor due to the recognition of investment tax credits (\"ITCs\") or other adjustments as required by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the Company records the impact (sometimes referred to as the \u2018Day one gain) to income in the same period.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the asset and liability balances reported as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; asset retirement obligations; impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets and equity method investments; valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets; the recoverability of regulatory assets; regulatory liabilities; the fair value of financial instruments; the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as business combinations or as asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; contingent consideration arising from business combinations or asset acquisitions by variable interest entities; the measurement of equity method investments or noncontrolling interest using the HLBV method for certain renewable generation partnerships; pension liabilities; the incremental borrowing rates used in the determination of lease liabilities; the determination of lease and non-lease components in certain generation contracts; environmental liabilities; and potential litigation claims and settlements.\nHELD-FOR-SALE DISPOSAL GROUPS - A disposal group classified as held-for-sale is reflected on the balance sheet at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. A loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the disposal group exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell. This loss is limited to the carrying value of long-lived assets until the completion of the sale, at which point, any additional loss is recognized. If the fair value of the disposal group subsequently exceeds the carrying amount while the disposal group is still held-for-sale, any impairment expense previously recognized will be reversed up to the lesser of the previously recognized expense or the subsequent excess.\nAssets and liabilities related to a disposal group classified as held-for-sale are segregated in the current balance sheet in the period in which the disposal group is classified as held-for-sale. Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are classified as current when they are expected to be disposed of within twelve months. Transactions between the held-for-sale disposal group and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information.\n135 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - Discontinued operations reporting occurs only when the disposal of a business or a group of businesses represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The Company reports financial results for discontinued operations separately from continuing operations to distinguish the financial impact of disposal transactions from ongoing operations. Prior period amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets are retrospectively revised to reflect the businesses determined to be discontinued operations. The cash flows of businesses that are determined to be discontinued operations are included within the relevant categories within operating, investing and financing activities on the face of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTransactions between the businesses determined to be discontinued operations and businesses that are expected to continue to exist after the disposal are not eliminated to appropriately reflect the continuing operations and balances held-for-sale. The results of discontinued operations include any gain or loss recognized on closing or adjustment of the carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell, including gains or losses associated with noncontrolling interests upon completion of the disposal transaction. Adjustments related to components previously reported as discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance are presented as discontinued operations in the current period even if the disposed-of component to which the adjustments are related would not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation under current guidance.\nFAIR VALUE - Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly, hypothetical transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The Company applies the fair value measurement accounting guidance to financial assets and liabilities in determining the fair value of investments in marketable debt and equity securities, included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line items Short-term investments and Other noncurrent assets; derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other noncurrent assets; and, derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other noncurrent liabilities. The Company applies the fair value measurement guidance to nonfinancial assets and liabilities upon the acquisition of a business or of an asset acquisition by a variable interest entity, or in conjunction with the measurement of an asset retirement obligation or a potential impairment loss on an asset group, equity method investments, or goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be reflected at their fair values, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance. The Company is prohibited from including transaction costs and any adjustments for blockage factors in determining fair value.\nIn determining fair value measurements, the Company maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities are categorized within a fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.\nAny transfers between all levels within the fair value hierarchy levels are recognized at the end of the reporting period.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers unrestricted cash on hand, cash balances not restricted as to withdrawal or usage, deposits in banks, certificates of deposit and short-term marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\nRESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES - Cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or usage, primarily via contract, are considered restricted cash.\n136 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that reconcile to the total of such amounts as shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,374 $ 943\nRestricted cash 536 304\nDebt service reserves and other deposits 177 237\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash $ 2,087 $ 1,484\nINVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES - The Company's marketable investments are primarily unsecured debentures, certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds.\nShort-term investments consist of marketable equity securities and debt securities with original maturities in excess of three months with remaining maturities of less than one year. Marketable debt securities where the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326. Remaining marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading and are carried at fair value.\nUnrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale debt securities that are not credit-related are reflected in AOCL, a separate component of equity, and the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any credit-related impairments are recognized as an allowance with a corresponding impact recognized as a credit loss in Other Expense. Unrealized gains or losses on equity investments are reported in Other income. Interest and dividends on investments are reported in Interest income and Other income, respectively. Gains and losses on sales of investments are determined using the specific identification method.\nACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Accounts and notes receivable are carried at amortized cost. The Company periodically assesses the collectability of accounts receivable, considering factors such as historical collection experience, the age of accounts receivable and other currently available evidence supporting collectability, and records an allowance for doubtful accounts in accordance with ASC 326 for the estimated uncollectible amount as appropriate. Credit losses on accounts and notes receivable are generally recognized in Cost of Sales. Certain of our businesses charge interest on accounts receivable. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. When collection of such interest is not reasonably assured, interest income is recognized as cash is received. Individual accounts and notes receivable are written off when they are no longer deemed collectible.\nINVENTORY - Inventory primarily consists of fuel and other raw materials used to generate power, and operational spare parts and supplies used to maintain power generation and distribution facilities. Inventory is carried at lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is the sum of the purchase price and expenditures incurred to bring the inventory to its existing location. Inventory is primarily valued using the average cost method. Generally, if it is expected fuel inventory will not be recovered through revenue earned from power generation, an impairment is recognized to reflect the fuel at net realizable value. The carrying amount of spare parts and supplies is typically reduced only in instances where the items are considered obsolete.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, assets under finance leases and intangible assets subject to amortization (i.e., finite-lived intangible assets).\nProperty, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost of renewals and improvements that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.\nConstruction progress payments, engineering costs, insurance costs, salaries, interest and other costs directly relating to construction in progress are capitalized during the construction period, provided the completion of the construction project is deemed probable, or expensed at the time construction completion is determined to no longer be probable. The continued capitalization of such costs is subject to risks related to successful completion, including those related to government approvals, site identification, financing, construction permitting and contract compliance. Construction-in-progress balances are transferred to electric generation and distribution assets when an asset group is ready for its intended use. Government subsidies, liquidated damages recovered for construction delays, and income tax credits are recorded as a reduction to property, plant and equipment and reflected in cash flows from investing activities. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\n137 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDepreciation, after consideration of salvage value and asset retirement obligations, is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are determined on a composite or component basis. Capital spare parts, including rotable spare parts, are included in electric generation and distribution assets. If the spare part is considered a component, it is depreciated over its useful life after the part is placed in service. If the spare part is deemed part of a composite asset, the part is depreciated over the composite useful life even when being held as a spare part.\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries operate under concession contracts. Certain estimates are utilized to determine depreciation expense for the subsidiaries, including the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and the amounts to be recovered at the end of the concession contract. The amounts to be recovered under these concession contracts are based on estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual amounts recovered may differ from those estimates. These concession contracts are not within the scope of ASC 853-Service Concession Arrangements.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization - Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives which range from 1 - 50 years and are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet line item Other intangible assets. The Company accounts for purchased emission allowances as intangible assets and records an expense when they are utilized or sold. Granted emission allowances are valued at zero.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets - When circumstances indicate the carrying amount of long-lived assets in a held-for-use asset group may not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the assets for potential impairment using internal projections of undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and eventual disposal of the assets. Events or changes in circumstances that may necessitate a recoverability evaluation include, but are not limited to, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, unfavorable changes in power prices or fuel costs, increased competition due to additional capacity in the grid, technological advancements, declining trends in demand, or an expectation it is more likely than not that the asset will be disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment expense is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value (subject to the carrying amount not being reduced below fair value for any individual long-lived asset that is determinable without undue cost and effort). An impairment expense for certain assets may be reduced by the establishment of a regulatory asset if recovery through approved rates is probable.\nDEBT ISSUANCE COSTS - Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of long-term debt are deferred and presented as a direct reduction from the face amount of that debt and amortized over the related financing period using the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit or revolving credit facility are deferred and presented as an asset and amortized over the related financing period. Make-whole payments in connection with early debt retirements are classified as cash flows used in financing activities.\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS - The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation for impairment. The Company's annual impairment testing date is October 1st.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the business acquisition over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill resulting from an acquisition is assigned to the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. Generally, each AES business with a goodwill balance constitutes a reporting unit as they are not similar to other businesses in a segment nor are they reported to segment management together with other businesses.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the quantitative test option to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss measured at the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill, is recorded.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets - The Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily include land-use rights and water rights. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or by performing the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset being tested for impairment exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as impairment expense.\n138 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES - Accounts payable consists of amounts due to trade creditors related to the Company's core business operations. These payables include amounts owed to vendors and suppliers for items such as energy purchased for resale, fuel, maintenance, inventory and other raw materials. Other accrued liabilities includes $662 million related to supplier financing arrangements, of which $296 million has a Parent Company guarantee; interest incurred for these arrangements is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest expense or, if eligible for capitalization, to Property, plant and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining balance of other accrued liabilities includes items such as income taxes, regulatory liabilities, legal contingencies, and employee-related costs, including payroll, and benefits.\nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES - The Company recognizes assets and liabilities that result from regulated ratemaking processes. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs which have been deferred due to the probable future recovery via customer rates. Generally, returns earned on regulatory assets are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Interest Income. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to refund customers. Management continually assesses whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and regulatory liabilities are probable of future payment by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs previously deferred ceases to be probable, the related regulatory assets are written off and recognized in income from continuing operations.\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS - The Company recognizes in its Consolidated Balance Sheets an asset or liability reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement plans with current-year changes in actuarial gains or losses recognized in AOCL, except for those plans at certain of the Company's regulated utilities that can recover portions of their pension and postretirement obligations through future rates. All plan assets are recorded at fair value. AES follows the measurement date provisions of the accounting guidance, which require a year-end measurement date of plan assets and obligations for all defined benefit plans.\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax basis. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company's tax positions are evaluated under a more likely than not recognition threshold and measurement analysis before they are recognized for financial statement reporting.\nUncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company has elected to treat GILTI as an expense in the period in which the tax is accrued. Accordingly, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded related to GILTI.\nThe Company applies the flow-through method to account for its investment tax credits.\nThe Company's accounting policy for releasing the income tax effects from AOCL occurs on a portfolio basis.\nThe Company has elected an accounting policy not to consider the effects of being subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in future periods when assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, carryforwards, and tax credits. Any effect on the realization of deferred tax assets will be recognized in the period they arise.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS - The Company records the fair value of a liability for a legal obligation to retire an asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred. When a new liability is recognized, the Company capitalizes the costs of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the obligation, the Company eliminates the liability and, based on the actual cost to retire, may incur a gain or loss.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - A business's functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the business operates and is generally the currency in which the business generates and expends cash. Subsidiaries and affiliates whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. dollar translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates in effect at the end of\n139 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nthe fiscal period. Adjustments arising from the translation of the balance sheet of such subsidiaries are included in AOCL. The revenue and expense accounts of such subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for the period. Gains and losses on intercompany foreign currency transactions that are long-term in nature and which the Company does not intend to settle in the foreseeable future, are also recognized in AOCL. Gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in determining net income. Accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments are reclassified from AOCL to net income only when realized upon sale or upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the investment in a foreign entity. The accumulated adjustments are included in carrying amounts in impairment assessments where the Company has committed to a plan that will cause the accumulated adjustments to be reclassified to earnings.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is earned from the sale of electricity from our utilities,the production and sale of electricity and capacity from our generation facilities, and development and construction of generation facilities. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.\nUtilities - Our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. The majority of our utility contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promises to transfer energy, capacity, and other distribution and/or transmission services are not distinct. Additionally, as the performance obligation is satisfied over time as energy is delivered, and the same method is used to measure progress, the performance obligation meets the criteria to be considered a series. Utility revenue is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices (tariffs) that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity. Since tariffs are determined by the regulator, the price that our utilities have the right to bill corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the utility's performance completed in each period. The Company also has some month-to-month contracts. Revenue under these contracts is recognized using an output method measured by the MWh delivered each month, which best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer, at the approved tariff.\nThe Company has businesses where it sells and purchases power to and from ISOs and RTOs. Our utility businesses generally purchase power to satisfy the demand of customers that is not contracted through separate PPAs. In these instances, the Company accounts for these transactions on a net hourly basis because the transactions are settled on a net hourly basis. In limited situations, a utility customer may choose to receive generation services from a third-party provider, in which case the Company may serve as a billing agent for the provider and recognize revenue on a net basis.\nGeneration - Most of our generation fleet sells electricity under contracts to customers such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our generation contracts, based on specific facts and circumstances, can have one or more performance obligations as the promise to transfer energy, capacity, and other services may or may not be distinct depending on the nature of the market and terms of the contract.\nFor contracts determined to have multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price using a market or expected cost plus margin approach. Additionally, the Company allocates variable consideration to one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services that form part of a single performance obligation when (1) the variable consideration relates specifically to the efforts to transfer the distinct good or service and (2) the variable consideration depicts the amount to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nIf the contract is determined to contain a performance obligation related to capacity, the performance obligation is generally satisfied over time, and if we use the same method to measure progress, the performance obligations meet the criteria to be considered a series. In measuring progress toward satisfaction of a performance obligation, the Company applies the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient when available and recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to consideration from a customer that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. Revenue from generation businesses is classified as non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n140 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nEnergy performance obligations are recognized using an output method, as energy delivered best depicts the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Performance obligations to deliver energy are generally satisfied when the MW is generated. In certain contracts, if plant availability exceeds a contractual target, the Company may receive a performance bonus payment, or if the plant availability falls below a guaranteed minimum target, we may incur a non-availability penalty. Such bonuses or penalties represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized when it is probable that there will not be a significant reversal.\nCertain generation contracts contain operating and sales-type leases where capacity payments are generally considered lease elements. In such cases, the allocation between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease following the guidance in ASC 842.\nIn assessing whether variable quantities are considered variable consideration or an option to acquire additional goods and services, the Company evaluates the nature of the promise and the legally enforceable rights in the contract. In some contracts, such as requirement contracts, the legally enforceable rights merely give the customer a right to purchase additional goods and services which are distinct. In these contracts, the customer's action results in a new obligation, and the variable quantities are considered an option.\nWhen energy or capacity is sold or purchased in the spot market or to ISOs, the Company assesses the facts and circumstances to determine gross versus net presentation of spot revenues and purchases. Generally, the nature of the performance obligation is to sell surplus energy or capacity above contractual commitments, or to purchase energy or capacity to satisfy deficits. Generally, on an hourly basis, a generator is either a net seller or a net buyer in terms of the amount of energy or capacity transacted with the ISO. In these situations, the Company recognizes revenue for the hours where the generator is a net seller and cost of sales for the hours where the generator is a net buyer.\nThe transaction price allocated to a construction performance obligation is recognized as revenue over time as construction activity occurs, with revenue being fully recognized upon completion of construction. These contracts may include a difference in timing between revenue recognition and the collection of cash receipts, which may be collected over the term of the entire arrangement. The timing difference could result in a significant financing component for the construction performance obligation if determined to be a material component of the transaction price. The Company accounts for a significant financing component under the effective interest rate method, recognizing a long-term receivable for the expected future payments related to the construction performance obligation in the Loan Receivable line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As payments are collected from the customer over the term of the contract, consideration related to the construction performance obligation is bifurcated between the principal repayment of the long-term receivable and the related interest income, recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nContract Balances - The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in accounts receivable and contract liabilities. Accounts receivable represent unconditional rights to consideration and consist of both billed amounts and unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. We bill both generation and utilities customers on a contractually agreed-upon schedule, typically at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly). The calculation of revenue earned but not yet billed is based on the number of days not billed in the month, the estimated amount of energy delivered during those days and the estimated average price per customer class for that month.\nOur contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue. The current portion of our contract liabilities is reported in Accrued and other liabilities and the noncurrent portion is reported in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations - The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. The Company has elected to apply the optional disclosure exemptions under ASC 606. Therefore, the amount disclosed in Note 20-Revenue excludes contracts with an original length of one year or less, contracts for which we recognize revenue based on the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed, and variable consideration allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation when the consideration relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and depicts the amount to which we expect to be entitled. As such, consideration for energy is excluded from the amount disclosed as the variable consideration relates to the amount of energy delivered and reflects the value the Company expects to receive for the energy\n141 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\ntransferred. Estimates of revenue expected to be recognized in future periods also exclude unexercised customer options to purchase additional goods or services that do not represent material rights to the customer.\nLEASES - The Company has operating and finance leases for energy production facilities, land, office space, transmission lines, vehicles and other operating equipment in which the Company is the lessee. Operating leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet, but are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Companys leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictive covenants or subleases.\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized on commencement of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Generally, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable; as such, we use the subsidiaries incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company determines discount rates based on its existing credit rates of its unsecured borrowings, which are then adjusted for the appropriate lease term and currency. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives that are paid or payable to the lessee at commencement. The lease term includes the option to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nThe Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer in which the Company is the lessor. Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease. Fixed lease payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned.\nThe Company has sales-type leases for BESS in which the Company is the lessor. These arrangements allow customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS, representing the transfer of control and constitutes the arrangement as a sales-type lease. Upon commencement of the lease, the book value of the leased asset is removed from the balance sheet and a net investment in sales-type lease is recognized based on the present value of fixed payments under the contract and the residual value of the underlying asset.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company grants share-based compensation in the form of restricted stock units, performance stock units, performance cash units, and stock options. The expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company uses a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to its employees.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES - General and administrative expenses include corporate and other expenses related to corporate staff functions and initiatives, primarily executive management, finance, legal, human resources, and information systems, which are not directly allocable to our business segments. Additionally, all costs associated with corporate business development efforts are classified as general and administrative expenses.\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES - Under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, the Company recognizes all contracts that meet the definition of a derivative, except those designated as normal purchase or normal sale at inception, as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value. See Note 5-Fair Value and Fair value in this section for additional discussion regarding the determination of fair value.\nPPAs and fuel supply agreements are evaluated to assess if they contain either a derivative or an embedded derivative requiring separate valuation and accounting. Generally, these agreements do not meet the definition of a derivative, often due to the inability to be net settled. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the markets for commodities to be delivered under these agreements to determine if facts and circumstances have changed such that the agreements could be net settled and meet the definition of a derivative.\nThe Company typically designates its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges if they meet the criteria specified in ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to hedge the variability of expected future cash interest payments. Foreign currency contracts are used to reduce risks arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The objective of\n142 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nthese practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The Company also enters into commodity contracts to economically hedge price variability inherent in electricity sales arrangements. The objectives of the commodity contracts are to minimize the impact of variability in spot electricity prices and stabilize estimated revenue streams. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nFor our hedges, changes in fair value are deferred in AOCL and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions affect earnings. If a derivative is no longer highly effective, hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively. For cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, AES estimates the future cash flows of the forecasted transactions and evaluates the probability of the occurrence and timing of such transactions.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in earnings. Regardless of when gains or losses on derivatives are recognized in earnings, they are generally classified as interest expense for interest rate and cross-currency derivatives, foreign currency transaction gains or losses for foreign currency derivatives, and non-regulated revenue or non-regulated cost of sales for commodity and other derivatives. Cash flows arising from derivatives are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity given the nature of the underlying risk being economically hedged and the lack of significant financing elements, except that cash flows on designated and qualifying hedges of variable-rate interest during construction are classified as an investing activity. The Company has elected not to offset net derivative positions in the financial statements.\nCREDIT LOSSES - In accordance with ASC 326, the Company records an allowance for current expected credit losses (CECL) for accounts and notes receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, net investments in leases recognized as a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities, financial guarantees related to the non-payment of a financial obligation, and off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance. The CECL allowance is based on the asset's amortized cost and reflects management's expected risk of credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the asset. CECL allowances are estimated using relevant information about the collectibility of cash flows and consider information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. See New Accounting Pronouncements below for further information regarding the impact on the Company's financial statements upon adoption of ASC 326.\nThe following table represents the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2022\nAccounts Receivable (1)\nMong Duong Loan Receivable Argentina Receivables(2)\nLease Receivable (3)\nOther Total\nCECL reserve balance at beginning of period $ 9 $ 30 $ 23 $ - $ 1 $ 63\nCurrent period provision 10 - 22 20 1 53\nWrite-offs charged against allowance (19) - - - (19)\nRecoveries collected 3 (2) (1) - - -\nForeign exchange - - (14) - - (14)\nCECL reserve balance at end of period $ 3 $ 28 $ 30 $ 20 $ 2 $ 83\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 Accounts Receivable (1)\nMong Duong Loan Receivable Argentina Receivables Other Total\nCECL reserve balance at beginning of period $ 9 $ 32 $ 20 $ 1 $ 62\nCurrent period provision 9 - 7 - 16\nWrite-offs charged against allowance (11) - - - (11)\nRecoveries collected 2 (2) - - -\nForeign exchange - - (4) - (4)\nCECL reserve balance at end of period $ 9 $ 30 $ 23 $ 1 $ 63\n_____________________________\n(1)Excludes operating lease receivable allowances and contractual dispute allowances of $1 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n143 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nASU Number and Name Description Date of Adoption Effect on the financial statements upon adoption\n2021-05, Leases (Topic 842), Lessors-Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments The amendments in this update affect lessors with lease contracts that (1) have variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and (2) would have resulted in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement if classified as sales-type or direct financing. Lessors should classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease if both of the following criteria are met: (a) The lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease in accordance with the classification criteria in paragraphs 842-10-25-2 through 25-3, (b) The lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. This update could be applied either (1) retrospectively to leases that commenced or were modified on or after the adoption of Update 2016-02 or (2) prospectively to leases that commence or are modified on or after the date that an entity first applies the amendments.\nJanuary 1, 2022 The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n2020-06, Debt - Debt with conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Equitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Equitys Own Equity The amendments in this update affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entitys own equity. The new ASU eliminates the beneficial conversion and cash conversion accounting models for convertible instruments. It also amends the accounting for certain contracts in an entitys own equity that are currently accounted for as derivatives because of specific settlement provisions. In addition, the new guidance modifies how particular convertible instruments and certain contracts that may be settled in cash or shares impact the diluted EPS computation. January 1, 2022 The Company adopted this standard on a fully retrospective basis and its adoption resulted in a $13 million increase to Preferred Stock and a corresponding decrease to Additional paid-in capital. No impact to Earnings per Share amounts reported in 2021 or 2022.\n2020-04, 2021-01, and 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting The amendments in these updates provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference to LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued by reference rate reform, and clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. These amendments are effective for a limited period of time (March 12, 2020 - December 31, 2024). Effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2024 The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis and it did not have a material impact on the financial statements.\nASC 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses and its subsequent corresponding updates (ASC 326). The new standard updates the impairment model for financial assets measured at amortized cost, known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities are required to use a new forward-looking \"expected loss\" model that generally results in the earlier recognition of an allowance for credit losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities measure credit losses as it was done under previous GAAP, except that unrealized losses due to credit-related factors are now recognized as an allowance on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the income statement.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective method of adoption for ASC 326. Under this transition method, the Company applied the transition provisions starting at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of the adoption of ASC 326 on our January 1, 2020 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was as follows (in millions):\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Balance at\nDecember 31, 2019\nAdjustments Due to ASC 326 Balance at\nJanuary 1, 2020\nAssets\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $20\n$ 1,479 $ - $ 1,479\nOther current assets\n802 (2) 800\nDeferred income taxes 156 9 165\nLoan receivable, net of allowance of $32\n1,351 (32) 1,319\nOther noncurrent assets (1)\n1,635 (30) 1,605\nLiabilities and Equity\nAccumulated deficit $ (692) $ (39) $ (731)\nNoncontrolling interests 2,233 (16) 2,217\n_________________________\n(1)Other noncurrent assets include Argentina financing receivables.\n144 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nMong Duong - The Mong Duong II power plant in Vietnam is the primary driver of changes in credit reserves under the new standard. This plant is operated under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25-year PPA. A loan receivable was recognized in 2018 upon the adoption of ASC 606 in order to account for the future expected payments for the construction performance obligation portion of the BOT contract. As the payments for the construction performance obligation occur over a 25-year term, a significant financing element was determined to exist which is accounted for under the effective interest rate method. Historically, the Company has not incurred any losses on this arrangement, of which no directly comparable assets exist in the market. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326 arising from this $1.4 billion loan receivable as of January 1, 2020, the Company considered average historical default and recovery rates on similarly rated sovereign bonds, which formed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator for this arrangement. A resulting estimated loss rate of 2.4% was applied to the weighted-average remaining life of the loan receivable, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including the Companys status as a large foreign direct investor in Vietnam, Mong Duongs status as critical energy infrastructure in Vietnam, and cash flows from the operations of the plant, which are under the Companys control until the end of the BOT contract. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $34 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit and Noncontrolling interests as of January 1, 2020.\nArgentina - Exposure to CAMMESA, the administrator of the wholesale energy market in Argentina, is the driver of credit reserves in Argentina. As discussed in Note 7-Financing Receivables, the Company has credit exposures through the FONINVEMEM Agreements, other agreements related to resolutions passed by the Argentine government in which AES Argentina will receive compensation for investments in new generation plants and technologies, as well as regular accounts receivable balances. The timing of collections depends on corresponding agreements and collectability of these receivables are assessed on an ongoing basis.\nCollection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. Historically, the Company has not incurred any credit-related losses on these receivables. In order to determine expected credit losses under ASC 326, the Company considered historical default probabilities utilizing similarly rated sovereign bonds and historic recovery rates for Argentine government bond defaults. This information formed an initial basis for developing a probability of default, net of expected recoveries, to be applied as a key credit quality indicator across the underlying financing receivables. A resulting estimated weighted average loss rate of 41.2% was applied to the remaining balance of these receivables, after adjustments for certain asset-specific characteristics, including AES Argentinas role in providing critical energy infrastructure to Argentina, our history of collections on these receivables, and the average term that the receivables are expected to be outstanding. As a result of this analysis, the Company recognized an opening CECL reserve of $29 million as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2020.\nOther financial assets - Application of ASC 326 to the Companys $1.5 billion of trade accounts receivable and $326 million of available-for-sale debt securities at January 1, 2020 did not result in any material adjustments, primarily due to the short-term duration and high turnover of these financial assets. Additionally, a large portion of our trade accounts receivables and amounts reserved for doubtful accounts under legacy GAAP arise from arrangements accounted for as an operating lease under ASC 842, which are excluded from the scope of ASC 326.\nAs discussed in Note 7-Financing Receivables, AES Andes recorded $33 million of noncurrent receivables at December 31, 2020 pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Fund created by the Chilean government in October 2019. The Company expects to collect these noncurrent receivables through the execution of sale agreements with third parties. However, given the investment grade rating of Chile and the history of zero credit losses for regulated customers, management determined that no incremental CECL reserves were required to be recognized as of January 1, 2020.\n145 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective - The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements once adopted. Accounting pronouncements not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have no material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective\nASU Number and Name Description Date of Adoption Effect on the financial statements upon adoption\n2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers This update is to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the following: 1. Recognition of an acquired contract liability 2. Payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that early adopts in an interim period should apply the amendments (1) retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and (2) prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. For fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n2022-04,Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 450-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations This update is to provide additional information and disclosures about an entitys use of supplier finance programs to see how these programs will affect an entitys working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. Entities that use supplier finance programs as the buyer party should disclose (1) the key terms of the payment terms and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided and (2) the unpaid amount outstanding, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and a rollforward of those obligations during the annual period. In each interim reporting period, the buyer must disclose the unpaid amount outstanding at the end of the interim period. For fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The ASU only requires disclosures related to the Company's supplier finance programs and does not affect the recognition, measurement, or presentation of supplier finance program obligations on the balance sheet or cash flow statement. The Company expects to adopt the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of 2023, except for the annual requirement to disclose rollforward information, which the Company expects to adopt and present prospectively beginning in the 2024 annual financial statements.\n2. INVENTORY\nInventory is valued primarily using the average-cost method. The following table summarizes the Company's inventory balances as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nFuel and other raw materials $ 733 $ 366\nSpare parts and supplies 322 238\nTotal $ 1,055 $ 604\n3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table summarizes the components of the electric generation and distribution assets and other property, plant and equipment (in millions) with their estimated useful lives (in years). The amounts are stated net of all prior asset impairment losses recognized.\n146 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nEstimated Useful Life December 31,\n(in years) 2022 2021\nElectric generation and distribution facilities 5-39\n$ 24,135 $ 22,909\nOther buildings 3-51\n1,197 1,552\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment 3-30\n348 356\nOther 1-40\n919 735\nTotal electric generation and distribution assets and other 26,599 25,552\nAccumulated depreciation (8,651) (8,486)\nNet electric generation and distribution assets and other $ 17,948 $ 17,066\nThe following table summarizes depreciation expense (including the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases and the amortization of asset retirement obligations) and interest capitalized during development and construction on qualifying assets for the periods indicated (in millions):\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nDepreciation expense $ 982 $ 972 $ 1,004\nInterest capitalized during development and construction 224 226 307\nProperty, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, of $9 billion was mortgaged, pledged or subject to liens as of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, including assets classified as held-for-sale.\nThe following table summarizes regulated and non-regulated generation and distribution property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation as of the dates indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nRegulated generation and distribution assets and other, gross $ 9,709 $ 9,151\nRegulated accumulated depreciation (4,067) (3,655)\nRegulated generation and distribution assets and other, net 5,642 5,496\nNon-regulated generation and distribution assets and other, gross 16,890 16,401\nNon-regulated accumulated depreciation (4,584) (4,831)\nNon-regulated generation and distribution assets and other, net 12,306 11,570\nNet electric generation and distribution assets and other $ 17,948 $ 17,066\n4. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table presents amounts recognized related to asset retirement obligations for the periods indicated (in millions):\n2022 2021\nBalance at January 1 $ 606 $ 462\nAdditional liabilities incurred 97 27\nLiabilities assumed in acquisition 15 96\nLiabilities settled (29) (15)\nAccretion expense 30 22\nChange in estimated cash flows 35 13\nOther 3 1\nBalance at December 31 $ 757 $ 606\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations include active ash landfills, water treatment basins and the removal or dismantlement of certain plants and equipment. The Company uses the cost approach to determine the initial value of ARO liabilities, which is estimated by discounting expected cash outflows to their present value using market-based rates at the initial recording of the liabilities. Cash outflows are based on the approximate future disposal costs as determined by market information, historical information or other management estimates. Subsequent downward revisions of ARO liabilities are discounted using the market-based rates that existed when the liability was initially recognized. These inputs to the fair value of the ARO liabilities are considered Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at Southland Energy, AES Clean Energy, AES Indiana, and AES Brasil by $75 million, $27 million, $27 million, and $16 million, respectively. The increase at Southland Energy is mostly due to additional liabilities incurred related to a demolition obligation at Alamitos. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to additional liabilities incurred as a result of new development projects. The increase at AES Indiana is primarily due to an upward revision of estimated cash flows at the Petersburg, Eagle Valley, and Harding Street plants. The\n147 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nincrease at AES Brasil is primarily due to the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations as a result of the Cubico II acquisition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company increased the asset retirement obligations and corresponding assets at AES Clean Energy and Chile by $93 million and $36 million, respectively. The increase at AES Clean Energy is mostly due to the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations as a result of the New York Wind acquisition. The increase in Chile is primarily due to shortened useful lives of the Ventanas and Angamos coal plants, additional liabilities incurred due to the development of the Andes Solar 2b plant, and an upward revision of estimated cash flows at the Los Cururos plant.\n5. FAIR VALUE\nThe fair value of current financial assets and liabilities, debt service reserves, and other deposits approximate their reported carrying amounts. The estimated fair values of the Company's assets and liabilities have been determined using available market information. Because these amounts are estimates and based on hypothetical transactions to sell assets or transfer liabilities, the use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\nValuation Techniques - The fair value measurement accounting guidance describes three main approaches to measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: (1) market approach, (2) income approach, and (3) cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount. The measurement is based on current market expectations of the return on those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace an asset. The Company measures its investments and derivatives at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, in connection with annual or event-driven impairment evaluations, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include long-lived tangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment), goodwill, and intangible assets (e.g., sales concessions, land use rights and water rights, etc.). In general, the Company determines the fair value of investments and derivatives using the market approach and the income approach, respectively. In the nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities, all three approaches are considered; however, the value estimated under the income approach is often the most representative of fair value.\nInvestments - The Company's investments measured at fair value generally consist of marketable debt and equity securities. Equity securities are either measured at fair value using quoted market prices or based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets. Debt securities primarily consist of unsecured debentures and certificates of deposit held by our Brazilian subsidiaries. Returns and pricing on these instruments are generally indexed to the market interest rates in Brazil. Debt securities are measured at fair value based on comparisons to market data obtained for similar assets.\nDerivatives - Derivatives are measured at fair value using quoted market prices or the income approach utilizing volatilities, spot and forward benchmark interest rates (such as LIBOR, SOFR, and EURIBOR), foreign exchange rates, credit data, and commodity prices, as applicable. When significant inputs are not observable, the Company uses relevant techniques to determine the inputs, such as regression analysis or prices for similarly traded instruments available in the market.\nThe Company's methodology to fair value its derivatives is to start with any observable inputs; however, in certain instances the published forward rates or prices may not extend through the remaining term of the contract, and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve, which necessitates the use of unobservable inputs, such as proxy commodity prices or historical settlements to forecast forward prices. Specifically, where there is limited forward curve data with respect to foreign exchange contracts beyond the traded points, the Company utilizes the interest rate differential approach to construct the remaining portion of the forward curve. Similarly, in certain instances, the spread that reflects the credit or nonperformance risk is unobservable, requiring the use of proxy yield curves of similar credit quality.\nTo determine the fair value of a derivative, cash flows are discounted using the relevant spot benchmark interest rate. The Company then makes a credit valuation adjustment (\"CVA\"), as applicable, by further discounting the cash flows for nonperformance or credit risk based on the observable or estimated debt spread of the Company's subsidiary or its counterparty and the tenor of the respective derivative instrument. The CVA for potential\n148 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nfuture scenarios in which the derivative is in an asset position is based on the counterparty's credit ratings, credit default swap spreads, and debt spreads, as available. The CVA for potential future scenarios in which the derivative is in a liability position is based on the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's current debt spread. In the absence of readily obtainable credit information, the Parent Company's or the subsidiary's estimated credit rating (based on applying a standard industry model to historical financial information and then considering other relevant information) and spreads of comparably rated entities or the respective country's debt spreads are used as a proxy. All derivative instruments are analyzed individually and are subject to unique risk exposures.\nThe fair value hierarchy of an asset or a liability is based on the level of significance of the input assumptions. An input assumption is considered significant if it affects the fair value by at least 10%. Assets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 when the use of unobservable inputs is significant. When the use of unobservable inputs is insignificant, assets and liabilities are classified as Level 2. Transfers between Level 3 and Level 2 result from changes in significance of unobservable inputs used to calculate the CVA.\nDebt - Recourse and non-recourse debt are carried at amortized cost. The fair value of recourse debt is estimated based on quoted market prices. The fair value of non-recourse debt is estimated based upon interest rates and other features of the loan. In general, the carrying amount of variable rate debt is a close approximation of its fair value. For fixed rate loans, the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") analyses. The fair value of recourse and non-recourse debt excludes accrued interest at the valuation date. The fair value was determined using available market information as of December 31, 2022. The Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the fair value amounts subsequent to December 31, 2022.\nNonrecurring measurements - For nonrecurring measurements derived using the income approach, fair value is generally determined using valuation models based on the principles of DCF. The income approach is most often used in the impairment evaluation of long-lived tangible assets, equity method investments, goodwill, and intangible assets. Where the use of market observable data is limited or not available for certain input assumptions, the Company develops its own estimates using a variety of techniques such as regression analysis and extrapolations. Depending on the complexity of a valuation, an independent valuation firm may be engaged to assist management in the valuation process.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the market approach, recent market transactions involving the sale of identical or similar assets are considered. The use of this approach is limited because it is often difficult to identify sale transactions of identical or similar assets. This approach is used in impairment evaluations of certain intangible assets. Otherwise, it is used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFor nonrecurring measurements derived using the cost approach, fair value is typically based upon a replacement cost approach. This approach involves a considerable amount of judgment, which is why its use is limited to the measurement of long-lived tangible assets. Like the market approach, this approach is also used to corroborate the fair value determined under the income approach.\nFair Value Considerations - In determining fair value, the Company considers the source of observable market data inputs, liquidity of the instrument, the credit risk of the counterparty, and the risk of the Company's or its counterparty's nonperformance. The conditions and criteria used to assess these factors are:\nSources of market assumptions - The Company derives most of its market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters). To determine fair value where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to develop its own estimates of market assumptions.\nMarket liquidity - The Company evaluates market liquidity based on whether the financial or physical instrument, or the underlying asset, is traded in an active or inactive market. An active market exists if the prices are fully transparent to market participants, can be measured by market bid and ask quotes, the market has a relatively large proportion of trading volume as compared to the Company's current trading volume, and the market has a significant number of market participants that will allow the market to rapidly absorb the quantity of assets traded without significantly affecting the market price. Another factor the Company considers when determining whether a market is active or inactive is the presence of government or regulatory controls over pricing that could make it difficult to establish a market-based price when entering into a transaction.\nNonperformance risk - Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation will not be fulfilled and affects the value at which a liability is transferred or an asset is sold. Nonperformance risk includes, but may not be limited\n149 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nto, the Company's or its counterparty's credit and settlement risk. Nonperformance risk adjustments are dependent on credit spreads, letters of credit, collateral, other arrangements available, and the nature of master netting arrangements. The Company is party to various interest rate swaps and options, foreign currency options and forwards, and derivatives and embedded derivatives, which subject the Company to nonperformance risk. The financial and physical instruments held at the subsidiary level are generally non-recourse to the Parent Company.\nNonperformance risk on the investments held by the Company is incorporated in the fair value derived from quoted market data to mark the investments to fair value.\nRecurring Measurements - The following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 1-General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company's financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated (in millions). For the Company's investments in marketable debt securities, the security classes presented were determined based on the nature and risk of the security and are consistent with how the Company manages, monitors, and measures its marketable securities:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nDEBT SECURITIES:\nAvailable-for-sale:\nUnsecured debentures $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ - $ -\nCertificates of deposit - 698 - 698 - 199 - 199\nGovernment debt securities - 3 - 3 - - - -\nTotal debt securities - 701 - 701 - 199 - 199\nEQUITY SECURITIES:\nMutual funds 38 - - 38 31 13 - 44\nTotal equity securities 38 - - 38 31 13 - 44\nDERIVATIVES:\nInterest rate derivatives - 314 - 314 - 51 2 53\nCross-currency derivatives - - - - - 5 - 5\nForeign currency derivatives - 22 64 86 - 29 108 137\nCommodity derivatives - 232 13 245 - 32 6 38\nTotal derivatives - assets - 568 77 645 - 117 116 233\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 38 $ 1,269 $ 77 $ 1,384 $ 31 $ 329 $ 116 $ 476\nLiabilities\nDERIVATIVES:\nInterest rate derivatives $ - $ 6 $ - $ 6 $ - $ 286 $ 8 $ 294\nCross-currency derivatives - 42 - 42 - 11 - 11\nForeign currency derivatives - 20 - 20 - 35 - 35\nCommodity derivatives - 346 60 406 - 37 7 44\nTotal derivatives - liabilities - 414 60 474 - 369 15 384\nTOTAL LIABILITIES $ - $ 414 $ 60 $ 474 $ - $ 369 $ 15 $ 384\nAs of December 31, 2022, all available-for-sale debt securities had stated maturities within one year. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no impairments of marketable securities were recognized in earnings or Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined using the specific-identification method.

FINANCING RECEIVABLES\nReceivables with contractual maturities of greater than one year are considered financing receivables. The following table presents financing receivables by country as of the dates indicated (in millions).\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGross Receivable Allowance Net Receivable Gross Receivable Allowance Net Receivable\nChile $ 239 $ - $ 239 $ 17 $ - $ 17\nU.S. 46 - 46 - - -\nArgentina\n5 - 5 11 1 10\nOther\n13 - 13 30 - 30\nTotal $ 303 $ - $ 303 $ 58 $ 1 $ 57\nChile - AES Andes has recorded receivables pertaining to revenues recognized on regulated energy contracts that were impacted by the Stabilization Funds created by the Chilean government in October 2019 and August 2022, in conjunction with the Tariff Stabilization Laws. Historically, the government updated the prices for these contracts every six months to reflect the contracts' indexation to exchange rates and commodities prices. The Tariff Stabilization Laws do not allow the pass-through of these contractual indexation updates to customers beyond the pricing in effect at July 1, 2019, until new lower-cost renewable contracts are incorporated to supply regulated contracts. Consequently, costs incurred in excess of the July 1, 2019 price are accumulated and borne by generators. Through different programs, AES Andes aims to reduce its exposure and has already sold a significant portion of the receivables accumulated as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, $26 million of current receivables and $227 million of noncurrent receivables were recorded in Accounts receivable and Other noncurrent assets, respectively, pertaining to the Stabilization Funds. Additionally, $12 million of payment deferrals granted to mining customers as part of our green blend agreements were recorded as financing receivables included in Other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2022.\nU.S. - AES has recorded a non-current receivable in connection with future premium payments on a heat rate\n154 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\ncall option entered into on behalf of the Southland Energy CCGT units. The premium payments are expected to be received in 2024.\nArgentina - Collection of the principal and interest on these receivables is subject to various business risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the continued operation of power plants which generate cash for payments of these receivables, regulatory changes that could impact the timing and amount of collections, and economic conditions in Argentina. The Company monitors these risks, including the credit ratings of the Argentine government, on a quarterly basis to assess the collectability of these receivables. The Company accrues interest on these receivables once the recognition criteria have been met. The Company's collection estimates are based on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. Actual future cash flows could differ from these estimates.\nAs a result of energy market reforms in 2004 and 2010, AES Argentina entered into three agreements with the Argentine government, referred to as the FONINVEMEM Agreements, to contribute a portion of their accounts receivable into a fund for financing the construction of combined cycle and gas-fired plants. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 years once the related plant begins operations.\nThe FONINVEMEM receivables are denominated in Argentine pesos, but indexed to USD, which represents a foreign currency derivative. Due to differences between spot rates, used to remeasure the receivables, and discounted forward rates, used to value the foreign currency derivative, these two items will not perfectly offset over the life of the receivable. Once settled, the foreign currency derivative will offset the accumulated unrealized foreign currency losses resulting from the devaluation of the FONINVEMEM receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of the foreign currency-related derivative assets associated with the FONINVEMEM financing receivables that were excluded from the table above had a fair value of $64 million and $108 million, respectively.\nThe receivables under the FONINVEMEM Agreements have been actively collected since the related plants commenced operations in 2010 and 2016. In assessing the collectability of the receivables under these agreements, the Company also considers historic collection evidence in accordance with the agreements.\n8. INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO AFFILIATES\nThe following table summarizes the relevant effective equity ownership interest and carrying values for the Company's investments accounted for under the equity method as of the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021\nAffiliate Country Carrying Value (in millions) Ownership Interest %\nsPower (1)\nUnited States $ 432 $ 492 50 % 50 %\nFluence United States 205 304 34 % 34 %\nGrupo Energ\u00eda Gas Panam\u00e1 Panama 82 41 49 % 49 %\nUplight United States 81 103 29 % 29 %\nEnerg\u00eda Natural Dominicana Enadom (2)\nDominican Republic 64 53 43 % 43 %\nMesa La Paz Mexico 32 48 50 % 50 %\nBarry (3)\nUnited Kingdom - - 100 % 100 %\nOther affiliates (4)\nVarious 56 39\nTotal $ 952 $ 1,080\n_____________________________\n(1)In February 2021, the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms were merged to form AES Clean Energy Development. See Note 25-Acquisitions for further information.\n(2)The Company's ownership in Energ\u00eda Natural Dominicana Enadom is held through Andres, an 85%-owned consolidated subsidiary. Andres owns 50% of Energ\u00eda Natural Dominicana Enadom, resulting in an AES effective ownership of 43%.\n(3)Represents a VIE in which the Company holds a variable interest, but is not the primary beneficiary.\n(4)Includes Bosforo, Tucano and various other equity method investments.\nsPower - In February 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, a consolidated entity, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. Since the sPower development platform was carved-out of AES existing equity method investment, this transaction resulted in a $102 million decrease in the carrying value of the sPower investment and the Company recognized a gain of $214 million in Other income.\nIn December 2021, AES acquired an additional 25% ownership in specifically identified projects of the sPower development platform. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $35 million in Other income. Subsequent to the transaction, AES has a 75% ownership interest in specifically identified projects of sPower through its ownership of AES Clean Energy Development, and 50% ownership interest in the sPower equity method investment. See Note\n155 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n25-Acquisitions for further information. As the Company still does not control sPower after these transactions, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment.\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to sell 49% of its indirect interest in a portfolio of sPower's operating assets (\"OpCo B\"). At the time the purchase and sale agreement was signed, a loss was expected upon closing the transaction, which occurred on February 28, 2023. The expected loss on sale was identified as a triggering event and the Company evaluated whether its investment in sPower was other-than-temporarily impaired. Based on managements estimate of fair value of $432 million, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of $175 million in Other non-operating expense in December 2022.\nsPower primarily holds operating assets where the tax credits associated with underlying projects have already been allocated to tax equity partners. The application of HLBV accounting increases the carrying value of these investments, as earnings are initially disproportionately allocated to the sponsor entity. Since sPower does not have any ongoing development or other value creation activities following the transfer of these activities to AES Clean Energy Development, the impairment adjusts the carrying value to the fair market value of the operating assets. sPower is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nAlto Maipo - In May 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Alto Maipo, as restructured, is considered a VIE. As the Company lacks the power to make significant decisions, it does not meet the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of Alto Maipo and therefore will not consolidate the entity. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Alto Maipo as management believes this approach will better reflect the economics of its equity interest. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value is insignificant. Alto Maipo is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nFluence - In June 2021, Fluence issued new shares to the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) for $125 million, which following the completion of the transaction, represented a 13.6% ownership interest in Fluence. As a result of the transaction, which AES has accounted for as a partial disposition, AES ownership interest in Fluence decreased from 50% to 43.2%, and the Company recognized a gain of $60 million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests.\nOn November 1, 2021, Fluence completed its IPO of 35,650,000 of its Class A common stock at a price of $28 per share, including the exercise of the underwriters option. Fluence received approximately $936 million in proceeds, after expenses, as a result of the transaction. AES ownership interest in Fluence decreased to 34.2%. The Company recognized a gain of $325 million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests. AES' ownership interest further decreased to 33.5% as of December 31, 2022 as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Fluence. As the Company still does not control Fluence after these transactions, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported as part of Corporate and Other.\nUplight - In July 2021, the Company closed on a transaction involving existing and new shareholders of Uplight. As part of the transaction, the Company contributed $37 million to Uplight; however, AESs ownership interest in Uplight decreased from 32.3% to 29.6% primarily due to larger contributions from other investors. The transaction was accounted for as a partial disposition in which AES recognized a loss of $25 million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests, mainly as a result of the settlement of share based awards at Uplight as well as the expenses associated with the transaction.\nIn October 2021, the Company contributed an additional $23 million to Uplight. AES' ownership interest decreased to 29.4% as a result of equity granted to retained executives at a company acquired by Uplight. As the Company still does not control Uplight after the transaction, it continues to be accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported as part of Corporate and Other.\nGas Natural Atl\u00e1ntico II - In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining equity interest in Gas Natural Atl\u00e1ntico II, S. de. R.L., a partnership whose purpose is to construct transmission lines for Colon. After additional assets were acquired, the Company remeasured the investment at the acquisition-date fair value, resulting in the recognition of a $6 million gain, recorded in Other income. The partnership, previously recorded as an equity method investment, is now consolidated by AES and is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nGrupo Energ\u00eda Gas Panam\u00e1 - In April 2021, Grupo Energ\u00eda Gas Panam\u00e1, a joint venture between AES and InterEnergy Power & Gas Limited, completed the acquisition of the Gatun combined cycle natural gas development project. AES holds a 49% ownership interest in the affiliate. The Company contributed $44 million to the joint venture as of December 31, 2021 and has contributed a total of $45 million as of December 31, 2022. As the Company does not control the joint venture, it is accounted for as an equity method investment and is reported in\n156 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nthe MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nGuacolda - In September 2020, Guacolda management reviewed the recoverability of the Guacolda asset group and determined the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying amount. Impairment indicators were identified primarily as a result of inability to re-contract Guacoldas generation after expiration of its existing PPAs driven by lower energy prices in Chile and reduced forecasted cash flows resulting from decarbonization initiatives of the Chilean Government. Guacolda recognized a long-lived asset impairment at the investee level, which negatively impacted the Company's Net equity in losses of affiliates by $127 million. As a result, the Companys basis in its investment in Guacolda was reduced to zero and the equity method of accounting was suspended.\nIn February 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement to sell its 50% ownership interest in Guacolda for $34 million. On July 20, 2021, the Company completed the sale, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $34 million, recorded in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests. Prior to its sale, the Guacolda equity method investment was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nBarry - The Company holds a 100% ownership interest in AES Barry Ltd. (\"Barry\"), a dormant entity in the U.K. that disposed of its generation and other operating assets. Due to a debt agreement, no material financial or operating decisions can be made without the banks' consent, and the Company does not control Barry. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, other long-term liabilities included $39 million and $44 million, respectively, related to this debt agreement.\nSummarized Financial Information - The following tables summarize financial information of the Company's 50%-or-less-owned affiliates and majority-owned unconsolidated subsidiaries that are accounted for using the equity method (in millions):\n50%-or-less Owned Affiliates Majority-Owned Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\nYears ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nRevenue $ 1,780 $ 1,316 $ 1,880 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1\nOperating margin (loss) (361) (53) 213 (1) (1) (3)\nNet income (loss) (527) (242) (538) - (3) (4)\nNet income (loss) attributable to affiliates (405) (40) (411) - (3) (4)\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021\nCurrent assets $ 2,223 $ 1,180 $ 125 $ 122\nNoncurrent assets 7,522 6,497 643 771\nCurrent liabilities 1,931 1,414 118 126\nNoncurrent liabilities 4,040 3,602 677 793\nStockholders' equity 2,978 1,792 (26) (26)\nNoncontrolling interests 796 869 (1) -\nAt December 31, 2022, retained earnings included $288 million related to the undistributed losses of the Company's 50%-or-less owned affiliates.

As of December 31, 2022, the underlying equity in the net assets of our equity affiliates exceeded the aggregate carrying amount of our investments in equity affiliates by $202 million.\n9. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill - The following table summarizes the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nUS and Utilities South America MCAC Eurasia Corporate and Other Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\nGoodwill $ 3,127 $ 644 $ 16 $ - $ 1 $ 3,788\nAccumulated impairment losses (2,611) - - - - (2,611)\nNet balance 516 644 16 - 1 1,177\nImpairment losses (133) (644) - - - (777)\nGoodwill acquired during the year - - - - 3 3\nGoodwill derecognized during the year (40) - - - (1) (41)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\nGoodwill 3,087 644 16 - 3 3,750\nAccumulated impairment losses (2,744) (644) - - - (3,388)\nNet balance $ 343 $ - $ 16 $ - $ 3 $ 362\n157 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nAES Andes - During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the AES Andes reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined under the income approach using a discounted cash flow valuation model. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized impairment expense of $644 million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES Andes to zero. The decrease in fair value since the date of our last impairment test was primarily driven by a higher discount rate resulting from increased interest rates and country risk premiums, as well as a decrease in forecasted energy prices and other unfavorable macroeconomic assumptions in Colombia.\nAES El Salvador - During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test for the El Salvador reporting unit. The Company performed a quantitative impairment test and utilized the income approach. The estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount and as a result the Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $133 million, reducing the goodwill balance of AES El Salvador to zero. Since the date of our last impairment test in 2021, the Company has seen market participants substantially increase return expectations for the perceived country risk for El Salvador. The impact of the increase has substantially increased our discount rate, resulting in a full impairment.\nOther Intangible Assets - The following table summarizes the balances comprising Other intangible assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets (in millions) as of the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGross Balance Accumulated Amortization Net Balance Gross Balance Accumulated Amortization Net Balance\nSubject to Amortization\nInternal-use software $ 582 $ (307) $ 275 $ 457 $ (279) $ 178\nContracts 342 (40) 302 183 (48) 135\nProject development rights (1)\n991 (17) 974 819 (8) 811\nEmissions allowances (2)\n37 - 37 18 - 18\nConcession rights 207 (50) 157 195 (33) 162\nOther (3)\n57 (20) 37 111 (17) 94\nSubtotal 2,216 (434) 1,782 1,783 (385) 1,398\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLand use rights 42 - 42 28 - 28\nWater rights - - - 3 - 3\nTransmission rights 16 - 16 19 - 19\nOther 1 - 1 2 - 2\nSubtotal 59 - 59 52 - 52\nTotal $ 2,275 $ (434) $ 1,841 $ 1,835 $ (385) $ 1,450\n_____________________________\n(1)Includes emission offset fee to the Air Quality Management District (\"AQMD\") in order to transfer emission offsets from retired legacy Southland units to the new CCGT.\n(2)Acquired or purchased emissions allowances are finite-lived intangible assets that are expensed when utilized and included in net income for the year.\n(3)Includes management rights, renewable energy credits and incentives, and other individually insignificant intangible assets.\nThe following tables summarize other intangible assets acquired during the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 Amount Subject to Amortization/Indefinite-Lived Weighted Average Amortization Period (in years) Amortization Method\nInternal-use software $ 136 Subject to Amortization 14 Straight-line\nContracts 196 Subject to Amortization 23 Straight-line\nProject development rights 67 Subject to Amortization 4 Straight-line\nEmissions allowances 35 Subject to Amortization Various As utilized\nLand use rights 13 Indefinite-Lived N/A N/A\nTransmission rights - Indefinite-Lived N/A N/A\nOther 1 Various N/A N/A\nTotal $ 448\n158 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDecember 31, 2021 Amount Subject to Amortization/Indefinite-Lived Weighted Average Amortization Period (in years) Amortization\nMethod\nInternal-use software $ 89 Subject to Amortization 6 Straight-line\nContracts 35 Subject to Amortization 12 Straight-line\nProject development rights 667 Subject to Amortization 35 Straight-line\nEmissions allowances 22 Subject to Amortization Various As utilized\nTransmission rights - Indefinite-Lived N/A N/A\nConcession rights (1)\n7 Subject to Amortization 12 Straight-line\nOther 2 Various N/A N/A\nTotal $ 822\n_____________________________\n(1)Represents the fair value assigned to the extension of the Tiet\u00ea hydroelectric plants' concession agreement with ANEEL.

On December 13, 2022, the Issuers entered into the Note Purchase Agreement for the issuance of up to $647 million of 6.55% Senior Notes due in 2047. The Notes were sold on December 14, 2022, at par for $647 million. Each of the Issuers is considered a Co-Issuer and will be jointly and severally liable with each other Co-Issuer for all obligations under the facility. As a result of the issuance, AES Clean Energy Development recorded a liability of $37 million, which represents its share of the Notes issued. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate carrying amount of the Notes attributable to AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings was $37 million and is reflected within Non-recourse debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn 2021, AES Clean Energy Development, AES Renewable Holdings, and sPower, collectively referred to as the Borrowers, executed two Credit Agreements with aggregate commitments of $1.2 billion and maturity dates in December 2024 and September 2025. The Borrowers executed amendments to the revolving credit facilities, which resulted in an aggregate increase in the commitments of $1.3 billion, bringing the total commitments under the new agreements to $2.5 billion. There was no change to the maturity dates under the amendments. Each of the Borrowers is considered a Co-Borrower and will be jointly and severally liable with each other Co-Borrower for all obligations under the facilities. As a result of the amendments and increases in commitments used, AES Clean Energy Development and AES Renewable Holdings recorded, in aggregate, an increase in liabilities of $964 million in 2022, resulting in total commitments used under the revolving credit facilities, as of December 31, 2022, of $1.3 billion, which is reflected within Non-recourse debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate commitments used under the revolving credit facilities for the Co-Borrowers was $1.8 billion.\nNon-Recourse Debt Covenants, Restrictions and Defaults - The terms of the Company's non-recourse debt include certain financial and nonfinancial covenants. These covenants are limited to subsidiary activity and vary\n162 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\namong the subsidiaries. These covenants may include, but are not limited to, maintenance of certain reserves and financial ratios, minimum levels of working capital and limitations on incurring additional indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $424 million and $370 million, respectively, of restricted cash was maintained in accordance with certain covenants of the non-recourse debt agreements.

In Puerto Rico, the subsidiary non-recourse debt defaults were triggered by failure to comply with covenants or other requirements contained in the non-recourse debt documents due to the bankruptcy of the offtaker.\nThe AES Corporation's recourse debt agreements include cross-default clauses that will trigger if a subsidiary or group of subsidiaries for which the non-recourse debt is in default provides 20% or more of the Parent Company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no defaults which resulted in or were at risk of triggering a cross-default under the recourse debt of the Parent Company. In the event the Parent Company is not in compliance with the financial covenants of its revolving credit facility, restricted payments will be limited to regular quarterly shareholder dividends at the then-prevailing rate. Payment defaults and bankruptcy defaults would preclude the making of any restricted payments.\nRECOURSE DEBT - The following table summarizes the carrying amount and terms of recourse debt of the Company as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nInterest Rate Final Maturity December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nSenior Variable Rate Term Loan SOFR + 1.125% 2024 200 -\nSenior Unsecured Note 3.30% 2025 900 900\nDrawings on revolving credit facility SOFR + 1.75% 2027 325 365\nSenior Unsecured Note 1.375% 2026 800 800\nSenior Unsecured Note 3.95% 2030 700 700\nSenior Unsecured Note 2.45% 2031 1,000 1,000\nOther (1)\nCDI + 7.00% 2022 - 25\nUnamortized (discount) premium & debt issuance (costs), net (31) (36)\nSubtotal $ 3,894 $ 3,754\nLess: Current maturities - (25)\nNoncurrent maturities $ 3,894 $ 3,729\n_____________________________\n(1)Represents project-level limited recourse debt at AES Holdings Brasil Ltda.\nThe following table summarizes the principal amounts due under our recourse debt for the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\n163 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDecember 31, Net Principal Amounts Due\n2023 $ -\n2024 200\n2025 900\n2026 800\n2027 325\nThereafter 1,700\nUnamortized (discount) premium & debt issuance (costs), net (31)\nTotal recourse debt $ 3,894\nIn September 2022, AES executed an amendment to its revolving credit facility.

The terms of the new notes are identical in all material respects to the terms of the old notes with the exception that the new notes have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In August 2021, $798 million and $997 million of the 2026 and 2031 Notes were exchanged under the offer, respectively. Although not all investors participated in the exchange, there was no change to the outstanding indebtedness.\nRecourse Debt Covenants and Guarantees - The Company's obligations under the revolving credit facility and indentures governing the senior notes due 2025 and 2030 are currently unsecured following the achievement of two investment grade ratings and the release of security in accordance with the terms of the facility and the notes. If the Companys credit rating falls below \"Investment Grade\" from at least two of Fitch Investors Service Inc., Standard & Poors Ratings Services or Moodys Investors Service, Inc., as determined in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility and indenture dated May 15, 2020 (BBB-, or in the case of Moodys Investor Services, Inc. Baa3), then the obligations under the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2025 and 2030 become, subject to certain exceptions, secured by (i) all of the capital stock of domestic subsidiaries owned directly by the Company or certain subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries owned directly by the Company and certain subsidiaries, and (ii) certain intercompany receivables, certain intercompany notes and certain intercompany tax sharing agreements.\nThe revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in certain activities, including, but not limited to, limitations on liens; restrictions on mergers and acquisitions and the disposition of assets; and other financial reporting requirements.\nThe revolving credit facility also contains one financial covenant, evaluated quarterly, requiring the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of recourse debt to adjusted operating cash flow of 5.75 times.\nThe terms of the Company's senior notes contain certain customary covenants, including limitations on the Company's ability to incur liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\n164 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n12. COMMITMENTS\nThe Company enters into long-term contracts for construction projects, maintenance and service, transmission of electricity, operations services and purchases of electricity and fuel. In general, these contracts are subject to variable quantities or prices and are terminable only in limited circumstances.

CONTINGENCIES\nGuarantees and Letters of Credit - In connection with certain project financings, acquisitions and dispositions, power purchases, and other agreements, the Parent Company has expressly undertaken limited obligations and commitments, most of which will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. In the normal course of business, the Parent Company has entered into various agreements, mainly guarantees and letters of credit, to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of AES businesses. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise achieved by a business on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the availability of sufficient credit to accomplish their intended business purposes. Most of the contingent obligations relate to future performance commitments which the Company or its businesses expect to fulfill within the normal course of business. The expiration dates of these guarantees vary from less than one year to no more than 16 years.\nThe following table summarizes the Parent Company's contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022. Amounts presented in the following table represent the Parent Company's current undiscounted exposure to guarantees and the range of maximum undiscounted potential exposure. The maximum exposure is not reduced by the amounts, if any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantees.\nContingent Contractual Obligations Amount (in millions) Number of Agreements Maximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions)\nGuarantees and commitments $ 2,406 81 < $1 - 400\nLetters of credit under the unsecured credit facilities 128 39 < $1 - 36\nLetters of credit under bilateral agreements 123 2 $59 - 64\nLetters of credit under the revolving credit facility 34 16 < $1 - 15\nSurety bonds 2 2 < $1 - 1\nTotal $ 2,693 140\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 1% to 3% per annum on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit.\nEnvironmental - The Company periodically reviews its obligations as they relate to compliance with environmental laws, including site restoration and remediation. For the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized liabilities of $10 million and $4 million, respectively, for projected environmental remediation costs. Due to the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment and remediation activities, future costs of compliance or remediation could be higher or lower than the amount currently accrued. Moreover, where no liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that the Company may be required to incur remediation costs or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses related to environmental matters, where estimable, to be up to $12 million. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include amounts accrued as discussed above.\n165 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nLitigation - The Company is involved in certain claims, suits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company has recognized aggregate liabilities for all claims of approximately $22 million and $23 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities. A significant portion of these accrued liabilities relate to regulatory matters and commercial disputes in international jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that these accrued liabilities will be adequate to cover all existing and future claims or that we will have the liquidity to pay such claims as they arise.\nWhere no accrued liability has been recognized, it is reasonably possible that some matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material but could not be estimated as of December 31, 2022. The material contingencies where a loss is reasonably possible primarily include disputes with offtakers, suppliers and EPC contractors; alleged breaches of contract; alleged violation of laws and regulations; income tax and non-income tax matters with tax authorities; and regulatory matters. In aggregate, the Company estimates the range of potential losses, where estimable, related to these reasonably possible material contingencies to be between $51 million and $88 million. The amounts considered reasonably possible do not include the amounts accrued, as discussed above. These material contingencies do not include income tax-related contingencies which are considered part of our uncertain tax positions. See Note 23-Income Taxes of this Form 10-K for further information.\nTiet\u00ea GSF Settlement - In December 2020, ANEEL published a regulation establishing the terms and conditions for compensation for the non-hydrological risk charged to hydro generators through the incorrect application of the GSF mechanism between 2013 and 2018. In accordance with the regulation, Tiet\u00ea will be compensated in the form of a concession extension period, initially determined to be 2.7 years, which will be amortized from the date of the agreement until the end of the new concession period. As of December 31, 2020, the compensation to be received from the concession extension was estimated to have a fair value of $184 million, based on a preliminary time-value equivalent calculation made by the CCEE, and was recorded as a reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. In March 2021, the CCEEs final calculation of fair value was $190 million and the Company recognized an additional reversal of Non-Regulated Cost of Sales of $6 million. In August 2021, ANEEL published Resolution 2.919/2021, establishing an extension for the end of the concession originally granted to AES Brasils hydroelectric plants, from 2029 to 2032. On April 14, 2022, the amended term was finalized and agreed upon by ANEEL and AES.\n14. LEASES\nLESSEE - Right-of-use assets are long-term by nature.

Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities were $14 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table shows the future lease payments under operating and finance leases for continuing operations together with the present value of the net lease payments as of December 31, 2022 for 2023 through 2027 and thereafter (in millions):\nMaturity of Lease Liabilities\nFinance Leases Operating Leases\n2023 $ 10 $ 36\n2024 9 35\n2025 9 33\n2026 9 32\n2027 9 30\nThereafter 310 650\nTotal 356 816\nLess: Imputed interest (181) (416)\nPresent value of lease payments $ 175 $ 400\nLESSOR - The Company has operating leases for certain generation contracts that contain provisions to provide capacity to a customer, which is a stand-ready obligation to deliver energy when required by the customer. Capacity payments are generally considered lease elements as they cover the majority of available output from a facility. The allocation of contract payments between the lease and non-lease elements is made at the inception of the lease. Lease payments from such contracts are recognized as lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas variable lease payments are recognized when earned.\nThe following table presents lease revenue from operating leases in which the Company is the lessor, recognized in Revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in millions):\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nLease Income 2022 2021\nTotal lease revenue $ 527 $ 595\nLess: Variable lease revenue (49) (75)\nTotal non-variable lease revenue $ 478 $ 520\n167 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table presents the underlying gross assets and accumulated depreciation of operating leases included in Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nLease Assets December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nGross assets $ 1,319 $ 2,423\nAccumulated depreciation (139) (765)\nNet assets $ 1,180 $ 1,658\nThe option to extend or terminate a lease is based on customary early termination provisions in the contract, such as payment defaults, bankruptcy, or lack of performance on energy delivery. The Company has not recognized any early terminations as of December 31, 2022. Certain leases may provide for variable lease payments based on usage or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments.\nThe following table shows the future lease receipts as of December 31, 2022 for 2023 through 2027 and thereafter (in millions):\nFuture Cash Receipts for\nSales-Type Leases Operating Leases\n2023 $ 25 $ 387\n2024 25 387\n2025 25 388\n2026 25 279\n2027 25 203\nThereafter 367 545\nTotal 492 $ 2,189\nLess: Imputed interest (264)\nPresent value of total lease receipts $ 228\nBattery Storage Lease Arrangements - The Company constructs and operates projects consisting only of a stand-alone battery energy storage system (BESS) facility, as well as projects that pair a BESS with solar energy systems. These projects allow more flexibility on when to provide energy to the grid. The Company will enter into PPAs for the full output of the facility that allow customers the ability to determine when to charge and discharge the BESS. These arrangements include both lease and non-lease elements under ASC 842, with the BESS component typically constituting a sales-type lease. The Company recognized lease income on sales-type leases through variable payments of $2 million and $3 million and interest income of $23 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the second quarter of 2022, the Company recognized a full allowance of $20 million on a sales-type lease receivable at AES Gilbert. See Note 21-Other Income and Expense for further information.\nPrior to January 1, 2022, due to the variable-based nature of lease payments under certain contracts, the Company recorded a loss at commencement of sales-type leases of $13 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These amounts are recognized in Other expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 21-Other Income and Expense for further information. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2021-05 in which lessors classify and account for certain leases with primarily variable-based lease payments as operating leases. The Company adopted this standard on a prospective basis. See Note 1-General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\n15. BENEFIT PLANS\nDefined Contribution Plans - The Company sponsors four defined contribution plans (\"the DC Plans\"). Two plans cover U.S. non-union employees; one for Parent Company and certain US and Utilities SBU business employees, and one for AES Ohio employees. The remaining two plans include union and non-union employees at AES Indiana and union employees at AES Ohio. The DC Plans are qualified under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Most U.S. employees of the Company are eligible to participate in the appropriate plan except for those employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, unless such agreement specifically provides that the employee is considered an eligible employee under a plan. Within the DC Plans, the Company provides matching contributions in addition to other non-matching contributions. Participants are fully vested in their own contributions. The Company's contributions vest over various time periods ranging from immediate up to five years. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, costs for defined contribution plans were approximately $31 million, $26 million and $21 million, respectively.\n168 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDefined Benefit Plans - Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their respective employees (\"the DB Plans\"). Pension benefits are based on years of credited service, age of the participant, and average earnings. Of the 28 active DB Plans as of December 31, 2022, five are at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans are at foreign subsidiaries.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's funded status, both domestic and foreign, as of the periods indicated (in millions):\n2022 2021\nU.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation as of January 1 $ 1,225 $ 173 $ 1,331 $ 218\nService cost 14 4 14 6\nInterest cost 28 17 24 15\nPlan amendments - - 8 -\nPlan curtailments - - - (23)\nPlan settlements - - - (1)\nBenefits paid (65) (13) (101) (10)\nDivestitures - (1) - -\nActuarial (gain) loss (288) (11) (51) (16)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rate changes - 8 - (16)\nBenefit obligation as of December 31 $ 914 $ 177 $ 1,225 $ 173\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets as of January 1 $ 1,218 $ 106 $ 1,249 $ 112\nActual return on plan assets (250) 7 60 9\nEmployer contributions 8 5 10 4\nPlan settlements - - - (1)\nBenefits paid (65) (13) (101) (10)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rate changes - 9 - (8)\nFair value of plan assets as of December 31 $ 911 $ 114 $ 1,218 $ 106\nReconciliation of funded status:\nFunded status as of December 31 $ (3) $ (63) $ (7) $ (67)\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the funded status of the DB Plans, both domestic and foreign, as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nAmounts Recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets U.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nNoncurrent assets $ 34 $ 7 $ 49 $ 7\nAccrued benefit liability-current - (8) - (7)\nAccrued benefit liability-noncurrent (37) (62) (56) (67)\nNet amount recognized at end of year $ (3) $ (63) $ (7) $ (67)\nThe following table summarizes the Company's U.S. and foreign accumulated benefit obligation as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nU.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 900 $ 170 $ 1,199 $ 165\nInformation for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 340 $ 169 $ 458 $ 165\nAccumulated benefit obligation 333 163 442 159\nFair value of plan assets 304 98 402 91\nInformation for pension plans with a projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 340 $ 169 $ 458 $ 165\nFair value of plan assets 304 98 402 91\n169 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the significant weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost, both domestic and foreign, as of the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nU.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nBenefit Obligation: Discount rate 5.41 % 13.23 % 2.82 % 10.45 %\nRate of compensation increase 2.75 % 11.06 % 2.75 % 7.76 %\nPeriodic Benefit Cost: Discount rate 2.82 % 10.45 % (1)\n2.45 % 7.53 % (1)\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.50 % 6.36 % 4.91 % 8.02 %\nRate of compensation increase 2.75 % 7.76 % 2.75 % 5.69 %\n_____________________________\n(1)Includes an inflation factor that is used to calculate future periodic benefit cost, but is not used to calculate the benefit obligation.\nThe Company establishes its estimated long-term return on plan assets considering various factors, which include the targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns.\nThe measurement of pension obligations, costs, and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions. These assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. These assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions.\nThe assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors: discount rates, salary growth, retirement rates, inflation, expected return on plan assets, and mortality rates. The effects of actual results differing from the Company's assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect the Company's recognized expense in such future periods. Unrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the corridor approach, under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is amortized.\nSensitivity of the Company's pension funded status to the indicated increase or decrease in the discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions is shown below. Note that these sensitivities may be asymmetric and are specific to the base conditions at year-end 2022. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. The funded status as of December 31, 2022 is affected by the assumptions as of that date. Pension expense for 2022 is affected by the December 31, 2021 assumptions. The impact on pension expense from a one percentage point change in these assumptions is shown in the following table (in millions):\nIncrease of 1% in the discount rate $ (1)\nDecrease of 1% in the discount rate 4\nIncrease of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets (13)\nDecrease of 1% in the long-term rate of return on plan assets 13\nThe following table summarizes the components of the net periodic benefit cost, both domestic and foreign, for the years indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost: U.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nService cost $ 14 $ 4 $ 14 $ 6 $ 12 $ 6\nInterest cost 28 17 24 15 35 14\nExpected return on plan assets (53) (7) (59) (8) (58) (7)\nAmortization of prior service cost 4 - 4 - 5 -\nAmortization of net loss 8 1 15 3 14 2\nCurtailment (gain) loss recognized - - - (17) - -\nTotal pension cost $ 1 $ 15 $ (2) $ (1) $ 8 $ 15\nThe following table summarizes the amounts reflected in AOCL, including AOCL attributable to noncontrolling interests, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022, that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nU.S. Foreign\nPrior service cost $ (3) $ 3\nUnrecognized net actuarial loss (20) (27)\nTotal $ (23) $ (24)\n170 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes the Company's target allocation for 2022 and pension plan asset allocation, both domestic and foreign, as of the periods indicated:\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nTarget Allocations 2022 2021\nAsset Category U.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign U.S. Foreign\nEquity securities 22% 12% 22.17 % 3.53 % 31.26 % 14.76 %\nDebt securities 78% 82% 77.28 % 92.14 % 68.37 % 82.40 %\nReal estate -% 2% - % 1.09 % - % 1.11 %\nOther -% 4% 0.55 % 3.24 % 0.37 % 1.73 %\nTotal pension assets 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 % 100.00 %\nThe U.S. DB Plans seek to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\nmaintenance of sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits and other lump sum payments;\nlong-term rate of return in excess of the annualized inflation rate;\nlong-term rate of return, net of relevant fees, that meets or exceeds the assumed actuarial rate; and\nlong-term competitive rate of return on investments, net of expenses, that equals or exceeds various benchmark rates.\nThe asset allocation is reviewed periodically to determine a suitable asset allocation which seeks to manage risk through portfolio diversification and takes into account the above-stated objectives, in conjunction with current funding levels, cash flow conditions, and economic and industry trends.

The redemption of the preferred shares was considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity. In December 2022, AES Indiana redeemed all of its outstanding preferred shares for $60 million. The preferred shares were retired upon redemption as there is no intention for the shares to be reissued. AES Indiana is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Development Tax Equity Partnerships - The majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy Development have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects. In some cases, these agreements contain certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that would enable the tax equity investor to exit in the future. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity.\nIn 2022, AES Clean Energy Development, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in multiple project companies to tax equity partners, resulting in a $157 million increase to Redeemable stock of subsidiaries. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nIPALCO - In December 2021, CDPQ made equity capital contributions of $34 million to AES U.S. Investments, subsequently contributed to IPALCO by AES U.S. Investments, and $48 million to IPALCO as part of a capital call to raise proceeds for AES Indiana's TDSIC and replacement generation projects. In December 2022, CDPQ made additional capital contributions of $77 million. The Company and CDPQ made capital contributions on a proportional share basis; therefore, the capital calls did not change CDPQ or AES' ownership interests in IPALCO. IPALCO is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\n172 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nPotengi - In March 2022, Tucano Holding I (Tucano), a subsidiary of AES Brasil, issued new shares in the Potengi wind development project. BRF S.A. (BRF) acquired shares representing 24% of the equity in the project for $12 million, reducing the Companys indirect ownership interest in Potengi to 35.5%. As the Company maintained control after the transaction, Potengi continues to be consolidated by the Company. As part of the transaction, BRF was given an option to sell its entire ownership interest at the conclusion of the PPA term. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity, which will be adjusted for earnings or losses allocated to the noncontrolling interest under ASC 810. Any subsequent changes in the redemption value of the exit rights will be recognized against permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. Potengi is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nColon - In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 49.9% minority ownership interest in Colon, reducing the value of the Colon temporary equity to zero. See Note 17-Equity for further information. Colon is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Development - On February 1, 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. As part of the transaction, AlMCo, our existing partner in the sPower equity method investment, received a 25% minority ownership interest in the newly formed entity along with certain partnership rights, though not currently in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future. As a result, the minority ownership interest is considered temporary equity.\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms and the value of the partnership rights initially recorded in the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in an $81 million increase in the value of the temporary equity. The temporary equity will be adjusted for earnings or losses allocated to the noncontrolling interest under ASC 810. Any subsequent changes in the redemption value of the exit rights will be recognized against permanent equity in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable. See Note 25-Acquisitions for further information. AES Clean Energy Development is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\n17. EQUITY\nEquity Units\nIn March 2021, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Units with a total notional value of $1,043 million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a forward stock purchase contract (2024 Purchase Contracts) and a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, issued without par and with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (Series A Preferred Stock).\nUpon reconsideration of the nature of the Equity Units, the Company re-evaluated its accounting assessment and concluded that the Equity Units should be accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2024 Purchase Contracts and the Series A Preferred Stock, as well as the Company's assessment of the applicable accounting guidance relating to combining freestanding instruments. The Equity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Accordingly, the shares associated with the combined instrument are reflected in diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also corrected the classification of certain amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Statement of Changes in Equity to reflect the 2024 Purchase Contracts and Series A Preferred Stock as one unit of account. The corrections have no impact on the Company's net earnings, total assets, cash flows, or segment information.\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Equity Units, the Company received approximately $1 billion in proceeds, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses. The proceeds for the issuance of 1,043,050 shares are attributed to the Series A Preferred Stock for $838 million and $205 million for the present value of the quarterly payments due to holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts (\"Contract Adjustment Payments\"). The proceeds will be used for the development of the AES renewable businesses, U.S. utility businesses, LNG infrastructure, and for other developments determined by management.\n173 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe Series A Preferred Stock will initially not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock will not accrete. The Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of the shares of the convertible preferred stock will have limited voting rights.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to support holders purchase obligations under the 2024 Purchase Contracts and can be remarketed. In connection with any successful remarketing, the Company may increase the dividend rate, increase the conversion rate, and modify the earliest redemption date for the convertible preferred stock. After any successful remarketing in connection with which the dividend rate on the convertible preferred stock is increased, the Company will pay cumulative dividends on the convertible preferred stock, if declared by the board of directors, quarterly in arrears from the applicable remarketing settlement date.\nHolders of Corporate Units may create Treasury Units or Cash Settled Units from their Corporate Units as provided in the Purchase Contract Agreement by substituting Treasury securities or cash, respectively, for the Convertible Preferred Stock comprising a part of the Corporate Units.\nThe Company may not redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to March 22, 2024. At the election of the Company, on or after March 22, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nThe 2024 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to purchase, on February 15, 2024, for a price of $100 in cash, a maximum number of 57,292,650 shares of the Companys common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments). The 2024 Purchase Contract holders may elect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series A Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to guarantee the holders obligations to purchase common stock under the terms of the 2024 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate and is determined over a market value averaging period preceding February 15, 2024.\nThe initial maximum settlement rate of 3.864 was calculated using an initial reference price of $25.88, equal to the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock on March 4, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the maximum settlement rate was 3.8691, equivalent to a reference price of $25.85. If the applicable market value of the Companys common stock is less than or equal to the reference price, the settlement rate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of common stock is greater than the reference price, the settlement rate will be a number of shares of the Companys common stock equal to $100 divided by the applicable market value. Upon successful remarketing of the Series A Preferred Stock (Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock), the Company expects to receive additional cash proceeds of $1 billion and issue shares of Remarketed Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe Company pays Contract Adjustment Payments to the holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts at a rate of 6.875% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2021. The $205 million present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments at inception reduced the Series A Preferred Stock. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment is made, the related liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to interest expense, approximately $5 million over the three-year term. As of December 31, 2022, the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments was $89 million.\nThe holders can settle the purchase contracts early, for cash, subject to certain exceptions and conditions in the prospectus supplement. Upon early settlement of any purchase contracts, the Company will deliver the number of shares of its common stock equal to 85% of the number of shares of common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable.\nEquity Transactions with Noncontrolling Interests\nAES Clean Energy Tax Equity Partnerships - The majority of solar projects under AES Clean Energy have been financed with tax equity structures, in which tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, including tax attributes, that vary over the life of the projects.\n174 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nIn 2022, AES Clean Energy Development, through multiple transactions, sold noncontrolling interests in multiple project companies to tax equity partners, resulting in a $230 million increase to NCI. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, AES Renewable Holdings completed similar sales of noncontrolling interests to tax equity partners, resulting in an $88 million, $127 million, and $144 million increase to NCI, respectively.

However, under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company was entitled to all earnings or losses until March 1, 2021, and any distributions related thereto. This transaction resulted in a $275 million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $266 million, net of tax and transaction costs, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from AOCL to NCI of $9 million.\nIn December 2022, the Company completed the sale of an additional 14.9% ownership interest for $157 million, which decreased the Company's economic interest to 50.1%. This transaction resulted in a $91 million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in-capital of $94 million, net of tax and transaction costs, partially offset by the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income from AOCL to NCI of $3 million. As the Company maintained control after these transactions, Southland Energy continues to be consolidated by the Company within the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nAES Brasil - In August 2020, AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. (\"AHB\") completed the acquisition of an additional 18.5% ownership in AES Brasil for $240 million. During the fourth quarter of 2020, through multiple transactions, AHB acquired another 1.3% ownership in AES Brasil for $16 million. In aggregate, these transactions increased the Company's economic interest in AES Brasil to 44.1% and resulted in a $214 million decrease in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $94 million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $120 million.\nIn addition, AHB committed to migrate AES Tiet\u00ea to the Novo Mercado, which is a listing segment of the Brazilian stock exchange that requires equity capital to be composed only of common shares.

The reorganization and the exchange of shares was completed on March 26, 2021, and the shares issued by AES Brasil started trading on Novo Mercado on March 29, 2021. The Company maintains majority representation on AES Brasils board of directors.\nThrough multiple transactions in 2021, AHB acquired an additional 1.6% ownership in AES Brasil for $17 million. These transactions increased the Companys economic interest in AES Brasil to 45.7% and resulted in a $13 million decrease in Parent Company Stockholders Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $6 million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $7 million.\nIn October 2021, AES Brasil concluded a follow-on offering for the issuance of 93 million newly issued shares, which further increased the Company's indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil to 46.7% and resulted in a $7 million increase in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to an increase in additional paid-in capital.\nIn September 2022, AES Brasil commenced a private placement offering for its existing shareholders to subscribe for up to 116 million newly issued shares, of which 107 million were subscribed. AES Holdings Brasil Ltda. and noncontrolling interest holders subscribed for 54 million and 53 million shares, respectively, thereby increasing AES indirect beneficial interest in AES Brasil to 47.4%% and resulting in additional capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $98 million, an increase in additional paid-in capital of $10 million, and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $3 million. AES Brasil is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nChile Renovables - In July 2021, AES Andes completed the sale of a 49% ownership interest in Chile Renovables SpA (Chile Renovables), a subsidiary which owns the Los Cururos wind facility, to Global Infrastructure Management, LLC (GIP) for $53 million.

As part of the transaction, AES Andes will contribute a specified pipeline of renewable development projects to Chile Renovables as the projects reach commercial operations, and GIP will make additional contributions to maintain its 49% ownership interest.\n175 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nIn January 2022, AES Andes completed the sale of Andes Solar 2a to Chile Renovables for $37 million, resulting in an increase to NCI of $28 million and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $9 million.

The transaction decreased the Companys indirect ownership interest in the operational entities from 45.3% to 36.3%.\nIn January 2022, the Ventus wind complex and AGV solar complex were incorporated by Guaimb\u00ea Holding. Guaimb\u00ea Holding issued additional preferred shares representing 3.5% ownership in the subsidiary for total proceeds of $63 million. The transaction further decreased the Companys indirect ownership interest to 35.8%. As the Company maintained control after these transactions, Guaimb\u00ea Holding continues to be consolidated by the Company within the South America SBU reportable segment.\nAES Andes - On December 29, 2020, AES Andes commenced a preemptive rights offering for its existing shareholders to subscribe for up to 1.98 billion of newly issued shares to fund its renewable growth program. The period ended on February 5, 2021 and Inversiones Cachagua SpA, an AES subsidiary, subscribed for 1.35 billion shares at a cost of $205 million, increasing AES indirect beneficial interest in AES Andes from 67% to 67.1%. The noncontrolling interest holders subscribed for 629 million shares, resulting in additional capital contributions of $94 million.\nIn December 2021, AES Andes sold shares acquired in the 2020 share buyback program as required by the holding period terms of the program, resulting in a decline in the Company's indirect beneficial interest in AES Andes from 67.1% to 67%. This transaction resulted in a $3 million decrease in Parent Company Stockholder's Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital.\nIn January 2022, Cachagua completed a tender offer for the shares of AES Andes held by minority shareholders for $522 million, net of transaction costs.

Through multiple transactions in 2022 following the tender offer, Cachagua acquired an additional 1% ownership in AES Andes for $22 million, further increasing AES indirect beneficial interest to 99%. The tender offer and these follow-on transactions resulted in a $172 million decrease to Parent Company Stockholders Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in capital of $96 million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from NCI to AOCL of $76 million. AES Andes is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nColon - In September 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 49.9% minority ownership interest in Colon, becoming its sole owner. In conjunction with the acquisition, a note payable was recorded that is expected to be satisfied over two installments by the end of 2023. This transaction resulted in a $12 million decrease in Parent Company Stockholders Equity due to a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $8 million and the reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive losses from Redeemable stock of subsidiaries to AOCL of $4 million. Colon is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nCochrane - In September 2020, AES Andes completed the sale of a portion of its stake in Cochrane. The transaction included the issuance of preferred shares and the sale of 5% of its stake in the subsidiary for $113 million, which decreased the Companys economic interest in Cochrane to 38%. The preferred shareholders have the preferential right to receive an annual amount equal to $12 million, from any dividends or distributions of capital, until reaching the original investment of $113 million plus a specified rate of return. As the Company maintained control after the sale, Cochrane continues to be consolidated by the Company within the South America SBU reportable segment.\nThe following table summarizes the net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation and all transfers (to) from noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated (in millions):\n176 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDecember 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation $ (546) $ (409) $ 46\nTransfers from noncontrolling interest:\nIncrease (decrease) in The AES Corporation's paid-in capital for sale of subsidiary shares 78 (7) 260\nIncrease (decrease) in The AES Corporation's paid-in-capital for purchase of subsidiary shares (78) (9) (89)\nNet transfers (to) from noncontrolling interest - (16) 171\nChange from net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation and transfers (to) from noncontrolling interests $ (546) $ (425) $ 217\nDeconsolidations\nAlto Maipo - In November 2021, Alto Maipo SpA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nThe segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the businesses internally and is mainly organized by geographic regions which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The management reporting structure is organized by four SBUs led by our President and Chief Executive Officer: US and Utilities, South America, MCAC, and Eurasia SBUs. Using the accounting guidance on segment reporting, the Company determined that its four operating segments are aligned with its four reportable segments corresponding to its SBUs.\nCorporate and Other - Included in \"Corporate and Other\" are the results of the AES self-insurance company and certain equity affiliates, corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our four reportable segments, and certain intercompany charges such as self-insurance premiums which are fully\n178 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\neliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company uses Adjusted PTC as its primary segment performance measure. Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the Company as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions and equity securities; (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses; (c) gains, losses, benefits and costs associated with dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, including early plant closures, and gains and losses recognized at commencement of sales-type leases; (d) losses due to impairments; (e) gains, losses and costs due to the early retirement of debt; and (f) net gains at Angamos, one of our businesses in the South America SBU, associated with the early contract terminations with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis adjusted for the same gains or losses excluded from consolidated entities. The Company has concluded Adjusted PTC better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company and is the most relevant measure considered in the Company's internal evaluation of the financial performance of its segments. Additionally, given its large number of businesses and complexity, the Company concluded that Adjusted PTC is a more transparent measure that better assists investors in determining which businesses have the greatest impact on the Company's results.\nRevenue and Adjusted PTC are presented before inter-segment eliminations, which includes the effect of intercompany transactions with other segments except for interest, charges for certain management fees, and the write-off of intercompany balances, as applicable. All intra-segment activity has been eliminated within the segment. Inter-segment activity has been eliminated within the total consolidated results.\nThe following tables present financial information by segment for the periods indicated (in millions):\nTotal Revenue\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 5,013 $ 4,335 $ 3,918\nSouth America SBU 3,539 3,541 3,159\nMCAC SBU 2,868 2,157 1,766\nEurasia SBU 1,217 1,123 828\nCorporate and Other 119 116 231\nEliminations (139) (131) (242)\nTotal Revenue $ 12,617 $ 11,141 $ 9,660\nReconciliation from Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations before Taxes and Equity in Earnings of Affiliates: Total Adjusted PTC\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nLoss from continuing operations before taxes and equity in earnings of affiliates $ (169) $ (1,064) $ 488\nAdd: Net equity in losses of affiliates (71) (24) (123)\nLess: Income from continuing operations before taxes, attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable stock of subsidiaries (96) 644 (192)\nPre-tax contribution (336) (444) 173\nUnrealized derivative and equity securities losses (gains) 128 (1) 3\nUnrealized foreign currency losses (gains) 42 14 (10)\nDisposition/acquisition losses 40 861 112\nImpairment losses 1,658 1,153 928\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 35 91 223\nNet gains from early contract terminations at Angamos - (256) (182)\nTotal Adjusted PTC $ 1,567 $ 1,418 $ 1,247\nTotal Adjusted PTC\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 570 $ 660 $ 505\nSouth America SBU 573 423 534\nMCAC SBU 559 314 287\nEurasia SBU 192 196 177\nCorporate and Other (326) (182) (256)\nEliminations (1) 7 -\nTotal Adjusted PTC $ 1,567 $ 1,418 $ 1,247\n179 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nTotal Assets Depreciation and Amortization Capital Expenditures\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 20,531 $ 16,512 $ 14,464 $ 574 $ 549 $ 534 $ 3,352 $ 1,115 $ 1,099\nSouth America SBU 9,423 7,728 11,329 267 273 294 1,071 833 650\nMCAC SBU 4,760 4,545 4,847 155 155 164 127 143 183\nEurasia SBU 2,870 3,466 3,621 44 66 63 23 20 9\nCorporate and Other 779 712 342 13 13 13 11 29 19\nTotal $ 38,363 $ 32,963 $ 34,603 $ 1,053 $ 1,056 $ 1,068 $ 4,584 $ 2,140 $ 1,960\nInterest Income Interest Expense\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 50 $ 28 $ 17 $ 359 $ 362 $ 371\nSouth America SBU 177 100 64 342 239 237\nMCAC SBU 8 7 14 150 139 157\nEurasia SBU 151 161 171 107 98 113\nCorporate and Other 3 2 2 159 73 160\nTotal $ 389 $ 298 $ 268 $ 1,117 $ 911 $ 1,038\nInvestments in and Advances to Affiliates Net Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Affiliates\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nUS and Utilities SBU $ 453 $ 510 $ 568 $ 54 $ 83 $ (8)\nSouth America SBU 22 19 13 2 - (80)\nMCAC SBU 180 144 168 (14) (23) (11)\nEurasia SBU 11 - 1 - 2 4\nCorporate and Other 286 407 85 (113) (86) (28)\nTotal $ 952 $ 1,080 $ 835 $ (71) $ (24) $ (123)\nThe following table presents information, by country, about the Company's consolidated operations for each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions).

In all circumstances, RSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the RSU in cash or other assets of AES.\n180 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, RSUs issued had a grant date fair value equal to the closing price of the Company's stock on the grant date. The Company does not discount the grant date fair values to reflect any post-vesting restrictions. RSUs granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 had grant date weighted average fair values per RSU of $20.92, $26.46, and $20.75, respectively.\nThe 2021 and 2022 RSUs awarded to certain executives have a performance condition related to the achievement of environmental, social and governance goals for the three-year periods ending December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. This performance condition can adjust the final number of units that vest to increase or decrease by up to 15% of the total units for all three years. The adjustment will be reflected in the number of units that vest at the end of the three-year performance period.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the Company's stock-based compensation related to its employee RSUs recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nRSU expense before income tax $ 16 $ 12 $ 10\nTax benefit (2) (2) (2)\nRSU expense, net of tax $ 14 $ 10 $ 8\nTotal value of RSUs converted (1)\n$ 8 $ 13 $ 11\nTotal fair value of RSUs vested $ 13 $ 10 $ 10\n_____________________________\n(1)Amount represents fair market value on the date of conversion.\nCash was not used to settle RSUs or compensation cost capitalized as part of the cost of an asset for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs of $25 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.16 years. There were no modifications to RSU awards during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nA summary of the activity of RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows (RSUs in thousands):\nRSUs Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Values Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Term\nNonvested at December 31, 2021 1,558 $ 24.14\nVested (576) 22.33\nForfeited and expired (102) 23.72\nGranted 821 20.92\nNonvested at December 31, 2022 1,701 $ 23.22 1.97\nExpected to vest at December 31, 2022 1,572 $ 23.25\nThe Company initially recognizes compensation cost on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. In 2022, AES has estimated a weighted average forfeiture rate of 5.27% for RSUs granted in 2022. This estimate will be revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments forfeited is likely to differ from previous estimates. Based on the estimated forfeiture rate, the Company expects to expense $16 million on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of three years years.\nThe following table summarizes the RSUs that vested and were converted during the periods indicated (RSUs in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nRSUs vested during the year 576 634 806\nRSUs converted during the year, net of shares withheld for taxes 380 452 547\nShares withheld for taxes 196 182 259\nOTHER SHARE BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has three other share-based award programs. The Company has recorded expense of $23 million, $14 million, and $21 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, related to these programs.\nStock options - AES grants options to purchase shares of common stock under stock option plans to non-employee directors. Under the terms of the plans, the Company may issue options to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a price equal to 100% of the market price at the date the option is granted. Stock options issued in 2020, 2021, and 2022 have a three-year vesting schedule and vest in one-third increments over\n181 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nthe three-year period. The stock options have a contractual term of 10 years. In all circumstances, stock options granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock option in cash or other assets of AES.\nPerformance Stock Units - In 2020, 2021, and 2022, the Company issued PSUs to officers under its long-term compensation plan. PSUs are stock units which include performance conditions. For 2020, 2021, and 2022, performance conditions are based on the Companys Parent Free Cash Flow target. The performance conditions determine the vesting and final share equivalent per PSU and can result in earning an award payout range of 0% to 200%, depending on the achievement. The Company believes it is probable that the performance condition will be met and will continue to be evaluated throughout the performance period. In all circumstances, PSUs granted by AES do not entitle the holder the right, or obligate AES, to settle the stock units in cash or other assets of AES.\nPerformance Cash Units - In 2020, 2021, and 2022, the Company issued PCUs to its officers under its long-term compensation plan. The value for the 2020, 2021, and 2022 units is dependent on the market condition of total stockholder return on AES common stock as compared to the total stockholder return of the Standard and Poor's 500 Utilities Sector Index, Standard and Poor's 500 Index, and MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America Index over a three-year measurement period. Since PCUs are settled in cash, they qualify for liability accounting and periodic measurement is required.\n20.

The contract liabilities from contracts with customers were $337 million and $216 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized revenue of $36 million and $410 million, respectively, that was included in the corresponding contract liability balance at the beginning of the periods.\nIn August 2020, AES Andes reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile, further accelerating AES Andes' decarbonization strategy. As a result of the termination payment, Angamos recognized a contract liability of $655 million, of which $55 million was derecognized each month through the end of the remaining performance obligation in August 2021.\nA significant financing arrangement exists for our Mong Duong plant in Vietnam. The plant was constructed under a BOT contract and will be transferred to the Vietnamese government after the completion of a 25 year PPA. The performance obligation to construct the facility was substantially completed in 2015. Contract consideration related to the construction, but not yet collected through the 25 year PPA, was reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2021, Mong Duong met the held-for-sale criteria and the loan receivable balance of $1.2 billion, net of CECL reserve of $30 million, was classified as held-for-sale assets. Of the loan receivable balance, $91 million was classified as Current held-for-sale assets, and $1.1 billion was classified as Noncurrent held-for-sale assets. As of December 31, 2022, Mong Duong no longer met the held-for-sale criteria, as such, the loan receivable balance of $1.1 billion, net of CECL reserve of $28 million, was classified as a Loan receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information.\nRemaining Performance Obligations - The transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents future consideration for unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations at the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $9 million, primarily consisting of fixed consideration for the sale of renewable energy credits (\"RECs\") in long-term contracts in the U.S. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately one-fifth of the remaining performance obligations in 2023 and 2024, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n21. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE\nOther income generally includes gains on insurance recoveries in excess of property damage, gains on asset sales and liability extinguishments, favorable judgments on contingencies, allowance for funds used during construction, and other income from miscellaneous transactions. Other expense generally includes losses on asset\n183 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nsales and dispositions, losses on legal contingencies, and losses from other miscellaneous transactions.

The quantitative impairment test resulted in an estimated fair value of the reporting unit which was less than its carrying amount. The failure of the goodwill impairment test was identified as an impairment indicator for the long-lived assets of the TEG TEP reporting unit. The Company performed an impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, in which it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The TEG TEP asset group was determined to have a fair value of $311 million using the income approach. As a\n184 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nresult, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $193 million. Subsequent to the asset impairment being recorded, the Company re-performed the goodwill test and no impairment was noted. TEG TEP is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nJordan - In November 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell 26% ownership interest in Amman East and IPP4 for $58 million and as of December 31, 2022, the generation plants were classified as held-for-sale. Due to the delay in closing the transaction, the carrying amount of the asset group in subsequent periods exceeded the agreed-upon sales price and total pre-tax impairment expense of $76 million was recorded during 2022. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. Jordan is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.\nMaritza - In May 2022, the Council for the European Union approved Bulgarias National Recovery and Resilience plan which commits the country to cease generating electricity from coal beyond 2038. As this plan is expected to prohibit the Company from operating the Maritza coal-fired plant through its estimated useful life, it was determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred. The Company reassessed the useful life of the facility and performed an impairment analysis as of April 30, 2022, in which it was determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. The Maritza asset group was determined to have a fair value of $452 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $468 million. Maritza is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.\nBuffalo Gap - During the fourth quarter of 2021, due to an expired PPA and volatile spot prices in the ERCOT market, management concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets of Buffalo Gap I, II, and III wind generation facilities may not be recoverable. As such, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the fair value of each asset group, using the income approach, was zero for Buffalo Gap I, II and III. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $29 million, $73 million, and $91 million at Buffalo Gap I, II, and III, respectively. Buffalo Gap is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nVentanas and Angamos - In August 2020, AES Andes reached an agreement with Minera Escondida and Minera Spence to early terminate two PPAs of the Angamos coal-fired plant in Chile, further accelerating AES Andes decarbonization strategy. AES Andes also announced its intention to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 1 and Ventanas 2 coal-fired plants. Management will no longer be pursuing a contracting strategy for these assets and the plants will primarily be utilized as peaker plants and for grid stability. Due to these developments, the Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amounts of these asset groups were not recoverable. The Angamos asset group was determined to have a fair value of $306 million, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $564 million and $213 million at Angamos and Ventanas 1 & 2, respectively.\nIn July 2021, AES Andes entered into an agreement committing to accelerate the retirement of the Ventanas 3, Ventanas 4, Angamos 1, and Angamos 2 coal-fired plants in Chile. Due to these strategic developments, the Company performed impairment analyses as of June 30, 2021, and determined that the carrying amounts of the asset groups were not recoverable. The Ventanas 3 & 4 and Angamos asset groups were determined to have fair values of $12 million and $86 million, respectively, using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $649 million and $155 million, respectively. Ventanas and Angamos are reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nMountain View I & II - In April 2021, the Company approved plans to execute a repowering project for the Mountain View I & II wind facility and signed two new PPAs for the energy and capacity related to the repowered asset. As the repowering will result in decommissioning the majority of the existing wind turbines in advance of their depreciable lives, the execution of the new PPAs was identified as an impairment indicator. The asset group was determined to have a fair value of $11 million using the income approach. As a result, the Company recognized pre-tax asset impairment expense of $67 million. Mountain View I & II is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nPuerto Rico - New factors arose in the first quarter of 2021 associated with the economic costs and operational and reputational risks of disposal of coal combustion residuals off island. In addition, new legislative initiatives surrounding the prohibition of coal generation assets in Puerto Rico were introduced. Collectively, these factors along with managements decision on how to best achieve our stated decarbonization goals resulted in an indicator of impairment at our asset group in Puerto Rico. As such, management performed a recoverability test in accordance with ASC 360 and concluded that Puerto Ricos undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying\n185 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nvalue of the asset group. The fair value of the asset group was determined to be $73 million, resulting in pre-tax impairment expense of $475 million. Puerto Rico is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\nEstrella del Mar I - In August 2020, the Estrella del Mar I power barge was disconnected from the Panama grid. Upon disconnection, the Company concluded that the barge was no longer part of the AES Panama asset group and performed an impairment analysis. The Company determined that the carrying amount of the asset was not recoverable and recognized asset impairment expense of $30 million. In September 2021, the Company recognized additional asset impairment expense of $11 million due to a change in the estimated market value of the power barge. See Note 24-Held-for-Sale and Dispositions for further information. Estrella del Mar I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nHawaii - In July 2020, the Hawaii State Legislature passed Senate Bill 2629 which will prohibit AES Hawaii from generating electricity from coal after December 31, 2022. Therefore, management further reassessed the economic useful life of the generation facility and a decrease in the useful life was identified as an impairment indicator. The Company performed an impairment analysis and determined that the carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Company recognized asset impairment expense of $38 million during the third quarter of 2020. The Company retired the generation facility in August 2022. Hawaii is reported in the US and Utilities SBU reportable segment.\n23. INCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision - The following table summarizes the expense for income taxes on continuing operations for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nFederal: Current $ 3 $ (2) $ (8)\nDeferred (18) 42 (17)\nState: Current 2 1 -\nDeferred 1 18 2\nForeign: Current 256 273 458\nDeferred 21 (465) (219)\nTotal $ 265 $ (133) $ 216\nEffective and Statutory Rate Reconciliation - The following table summarizes a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate as a percentage of income from continuing operations before taxes for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nStatutory Federal tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 %\nState taxes, net of Federal tax benefit (1) % (6) % (6) %\nTaxes on foreign earnings (42) % (2) % 15 %\nValuation allowance (10) % 7 % 16 %\nUncertain tax positions 7 % 16 % - %\nChange in tax law - % (1) % 3 %\nU.S. Investment Tax Credit - % - % (8) %\nAlto Maipo deconsolidation - % (17) % - %\nNoncontrolling interest on Buffalo Gap impairments - % (3) % - %\nNondeductible goodwill impairments (127) % - % - %\nOther-net (5) % (2) % 3 %\nEffective tax rate (157) % 13 % 44 %\nFor 2022, included in the (42)% taxes on foreign earnings is the impact of favorable LNG sales at certain MCAC businesses and inflation and foreign currency impacts at certain Argentine businesses. The (127)% nondeductible goodwill impairments relates to the impairments at AES Andes and AES El Salvador. Not included in the 2022 effective tax rate is $27 million of income tax expense recorded to additional paid-in capital related to the Company's sale of 14.9% of its ownership interest in the Southland Energy assets. See Note 17-Equity for details of the sale.\nFor 2021, included in the 7% for valuation allowance is approximately $93 million related to the release of valuation allowance at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries. Included in the 16% uncertain tax positions is approximately $176 million of income tax benefit related to effective settlement resulting from the exam closure of the Companys U.S. 2017 tax return, the focus of which was on the TCJA one-time transition tax. The (17)% included in the Alto Maipo deconsolidation item above primarily reflects the lack of tax benefit for approximately\n186 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n$775 million of the $2,074 million pretax Alto Maipo deconsolidation loss. Also included in this item is approximately $41 million of tax benefit related to resulting tax over book outside basis difference in Alto Maipo, which is offset by $41 million of tax expense in the valuation allowance line item. The (3)% Buffalo Gap impairments item relates to the amounts of impairment allocated to tax equity noncontrolling interest which are nondeductible.\nFor 2020, the 15% taxes on foreign earnings item includes $20 million of tax benefit associated with the Company's equity investment in Guacolda. Included in the 2020 (8)% U.S. investment tax credit is $35 million of benefit associated with the Na Pua Makani wind facility. Not included in the 2020 effective tax rate is $75 million of income tax expense recorded to additional paid-in-capital related to the Company's sale of 35% of its ownership interest in the Southland Energy assets. See Note 17-Equity for details of the sale.\nIncome Tax Receivables and Payables - The current income taxes receivable and payable are included in Other current assets and Accrued and other liabilities, respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The noncurrent income taxes receivable and payable are included in Other noncurrent assets and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively, on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes the income taxes receivable and payable as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nIncome taxes receivable-current $ 107 $ 184\nIncome taxes receivable-noncurrent 69 2\nTotal income taxes receivable $ 176 $ 186\nIncome taxes payable-current $ 104 $ 133\nIncome taxes payable-noncurrent - -\nTotal income taxes payable $ 104 $ 133\nDeferred Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and (b) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. These items are stated at the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards for tax return purposes of approximately $1.4 billion, of which approximately $30 million expire in 2036 and $1.37 billion carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had federal general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately $70 million, of which $14 million expire in years 2023 to 2032 and $56 million expire in years 2035 to 2042. Additionally, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022 of approximately $6.1 billion expiring primarily in years 2023 to 2042. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.1 billion that expire at various times beginning in 2023 and some of which carry forward without expiration.\nValuation allowances increased $49 million during 2022 to $577 million at December 31, 2022. This net increase was primarily the result of valuation allowance established at acquisition of a Brazilian subsidiary.\nValuation allowances decreased $106 million during 2021 to $528 million at December 31, 2021. This net decrease was primarily due to the release of valuation allowance at one of our Brazilian subsidiaries.\nThe Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets as shown below will be realized when future taxable income is generated through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and income that is expected to be generated by businesses that have long-term contracts or a history of generating taxable income.\n187 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes deferred tax assets and liabilities, as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nDifferences between book and tax basis of property $ (903) $ (961)\nInvestment in U.S. tax partnerships (582) (629)\nOther taxable temporary differences (350) (418)\nTotal deferred tax liability (1,835) (2,008)\nOperating loss carryforwards 1,129 979\nCapital loss carryforwards 62 77\nBad debt and other book provisions 57 380\nTax credit carryforwards 62 68\nOther deductible temporary differences 282 464\nTotal gross deferred tax asset 1,592 1,968\nLess: Valuation allowance (577) (528)\nTotal net deferred tax asset 1,015 1,440\nNet deferred tax liability $ (820) $ (568)\nThe Company considers undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Except for the one-time transition tax in the U.S., no taxes have been recorded with respect to our indefinitely reinvested earnings in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for income taxes. Should the earnings be remitted as dividends, the Company may be subject to additional foreign withholding and state income taxes. Under the TCJA, future distributions from foreign subsidiaries will generally be subject to a federal dividends received deduction in the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative amount of U.S. GAAP foreign un-remitted earnings upon which additional income taxes have not been provided is approximately $3 billion. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of any additional taxes which may be payable on the undistributed earnings.\nIncome from operations in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. The Company's income tax benefits related to the tax status of these operations are estimated to be $27 million, $27 million and $33 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The per share effect of these benefits after noncontrolling interests was $0.02, $0.02 and $0.03 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in the Company's income tax benefits is the benefit related to our operations in Vietnam, which is estimated to be $18 million, $16 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The per share effect of these benefits related to our operations in Vietnam after noncontrolling interest was $0.01 for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table shows the income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes, net equity in earnings of affiliates and noncontrolling interests, for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nU.S. $ 22 $ 622 $ (135)\nNon-U.S. (191) (1,686) 623\nTotal $ (169) $ (1,064) $ 488\nUncertain Tax Positions - Uncertain tax positions have been classified as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless they are expected to be paid within one year. The Company's policy for interest and penalties related to income tax exposures is to recognize interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table shows the total amount of gross accrued income taxes related to interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nInterest related $ 2 $ 2\nPenalties related - 1\nThe following table shows the expense/(benefit) related to interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021 2020\nTotal benefit for interest related to unrecognized tax benefits $ - $ 1 $ -\nTotal expense for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits - 1 -\nWe are potentially subject to income tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and internationally until the applicable statute of limitations expires. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. The following is a summary of tax years potentially subject to examination in the significant tax and\n188 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nbusiness jurisdictions in which we operate:\nJurisdiction Tax Years Subject to Examination\nArgentina 2016-2022\nBrazil 2016-2022\nChile 2019-2022\nColombia 2016-2022\nDominican Republic 2019-2022\nEl Salvador 2019-2022\nNetherlands 2016-2022\nPanama 2019-2022\nUnited Kingdom 2019-2022\nUnited States (Federal) 2017-2022\nAs of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $107 million, $122 million and $458 million, respectively. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would benefit the effective tax rate as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is $107 million, $122 million and $439 million, respectively, of which $2 million, $4 million, and $33 million, respectively, would be in the form of tax attributes that would warrant a full valuation allowance. Further, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that would benefit the effective tax rate as of 2022 would be reduced by approximately $34 million of tax expense related to remeasurement from 35% to 21%.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated to result in a net decrease to unrecognized tax benefits within 12 months of December 31, 2022 is estimated to be between zero and $10 million, primarily relating to statute of limitation lapses and tax exam settlements.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the periods indicated (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance at January 1 $ 122 $ 458 $ 465\nAdditions for current year tax positions 4 28 -\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years - 14 3\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (16) - (6)\nSettlements (3) (377) -\nLapse of statute of limitations - (1) (4)\nBalance at December 31 $ 107 $ 122 $ 458\nThe 2021 settlement amount of $377 million above primarily relates to effective settlement of historic unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the exam closure of the Companys U.S. 2017 tax return, the focus of which was on the TCJA one-time transition tax assessed on cumulative foreign earnings and profits. This amount is based on the pre-TCJA income tax rate of 35% though the actual impact to the Companys income tax expense is an income tax benefit computed at 21%.\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are currently under examination by the relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe we have appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits. However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty. It is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax benefits in amounts that could be material, but cannot be estimated as of December 31, 2022. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted.\n189 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\n24. HELD-FOR-SALE AND DISPOSITIONS\nHeld-for-Sale\nMong Duong - In December 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its entire 51% ownership interest in Mong Duong, a coal-fired plant in Vietnam, and 51% equity interest in Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V, an SPV accounted for as an equity affiliate. As a result, the Mong Duong plant and SPV were classified as held-for-sale, but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. The transaction was not closed by December 31, 2022 and the agreement was terminated by the parties. As of December 31, 2022, the Mong Duong plant and SPV no longer met the held-for-sale criteria and were reclassified to held and used. Mong Duong is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.\nJordan - In November 2020, the Company signed an agreement to sell 26% ownership interest in IPP1 and IPP4 for $58 million. The sale is expected to close in 2023. After completion of the sale, the Company will retain a 10% ownership interest in IPP1 and IPP4, which will be accounted for as an equity method investment. As of December 31, 2022, the generation plants were classified as held-for-sale, but did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. On a consolidated basis, the carrying value of the plants held-for-sale as of December 31, 2022 was $164 million. Jordan is reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.\nExcluding any impairment charges, pre-tax income attributable to AES of businesses held-for-sale as of December 31, 2022 was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nJordan (6) 21 20\nDispositions\nColon transmission line - In December 2021, Gas Natural Atl\u00e1ntico II S. de.

Prior to its sale, the Colon transmission line was reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nAlto Maipo - In November 2021, Alto Maipo SpA filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, the Company determined it no longer had control over Alto Maipo, resulting in its deconsolidation. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss on deconsolidation of $2,074 million in Loss on disposal and sale of business interests on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As Alto Maipo represents a component of AES Andes single reporting unit, the carrying value of the net assets of Alto Maipo included an allocation of $224 million of AES Andes consolidated goodwill balance of $868 million prior to deconsolidation. The Company allocated AES Andes goodwill based on the relative fair value of the component, which was determined based on the relative fair values of the business to be disposed and the portion of the reporting unit to be retained. Subsequent to the deconsolidation of Alto Maipo, the company evaluated the remaining Andes Reporting Unit goodwill and determined the goodwill was not at-risk.\nThe deconsolidation did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. After deconsolidation, the Company's retained investment in Alto Maipo was recognized as a financial asset with zero fair value, utilizing a restructuring model of cash flows and a cost of equity of 21%. Prior to deconsolidation, Alto Maipo was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.

Prior to its sale, Itabo was reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\nUruguaiana - In September 2020, the Company completed the sale of its entire interest in AES Uruguaiana, resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $95 million, primarily due to the write-off of cumulative translation adjustments. As part of the sale agreement, the Company has guaranteed payment of certain contingent liabilities and provided indemnifications to the buyer which were estimated to have a fair value of $22 million. The sale did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations. Prior to its sale, Uruguaiana was reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nKazakhstan Hydroelectric - Affiliates of the Company (the Affiliates) previously operated Shulbinsk HPP and Ust-Kamenogorsk HPP (the HPPs), two hydroelectric plants in Kazakhstan, under a concession agreement with the Republic of Kazakhstan (ROK). In April 2017, the ROK initiated the process to transfer these plants back to the ROK. The ROK indicated that arbitration would be necessary to determine the correct Return Share Transfer Payment (\"RST\") and, rather than paying the Affiliates, deposited the RST into an escrow account. In exchange, the Affiliates transferred 100% of the shares in the HPPs to the ROK, under protest and with a full reservation of rights. In February 2018, the Affiliates initiated the arbitration process in international court to recover at least $75 million of the RST placed in escrow, based on the September 30, 2017 RST calculation.\nIn May 2020, the arbitrator issued a final decision in favor of the Affiliates, awarding the Affiliates a net amount of damages of approximately $45 million, which has been collected. AES recorded the remaining $30 million as a loss on sale during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Prior to their transfer, the Kazakhstan HPPs were reported in the Eurasia SBU reportable segment.\nRedondo Beach Land - In March 2020, the Company completed the sale of land held by AES Redondo Beach, a gas-fired generating facility in California.

These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration. Caju\u00edna is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nCubico I - In April 2021, AES Brasil completed the acquisition of the Cubico I wind complex for $109 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, therefore the consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, were allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Cubico I is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nAES Clean Energy Development - In February 2021, the Company substantially completed the merger of the sPower and AES Renewable Holdings development platforms to form AES Clean Energy Development, which will serve as the development vehicle for all future renewable projects in the U.S. As part of the transaction, AES acquired an additional 25% ownership interest in the sPower development platform from AIMCo, our existing partner in the sPower equity method investment, in exchange for a 25% ownership interest in specifically identified development entities of AES Renewable Holdings, certain future exit rights in the new partnership, and $7 million of cash.\nThe sPower development platform was carved-out of AES existing equity method investment. AES basis in the portion of assets transferred was $102 million, and the contribution to AES Clean Energy Development resulted in a corresponding decrease in the carrying value of the sPower investment. See Note 8-Investments in and Advances to Affiliates for further information.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the sPower development assets transferred were remeasured at their acquisition-date preliminary fair values, resulting in the recognition of a $36 million gain, recorded in Other income on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recorded $81 million in Goodwill as of the acquisition date, representing the difference between the fair value of the consideration transferred, the noncontrolling interest in the sPower development platform, and the acquisition-date fair value of the Companys previously held equity interest and the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n193 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments as result of additional facts and circumstances that existed as of the date of the acquisition but were not yet known as of the time of the valuation performed in the first quarter of 2021. As a result, the estimated acquisition-date carrying value and fair values of the sPower development assets transferred were increased, which resulted in the recognition of an additional $178 million gain, for an updated gain of $214 million. Furthermore, the estimated goodwill as of the acquisition date was reduced to $45 million, as a result of adjustments to the fair value of the consideration paid and updates to the fair values of separately identifiable intangible assets. The Company finalized the purchase price allocation in the third quarter of 2021, which did not result in any material measurement period adjustments.\nSubsequent to the closing of the transaction, AES holds a 75% ownership interest in AES Clean Energy Development. AIMCo holds the remaining 25% minority interest along with certain partnership rights, though currently not in effect, that would enable AIMCo to exit in the future.

These acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions of variable interest entities that did not meet the definition of a business; therefore, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their fair values, which equaled the fair value of the consideration. During the third quarter of 2021, the contingent liabilities which related primarily to certain price adjustment features were remeasured, resulting in contingent consideration assets of $2 million and $12 million for Great Cove I and Great Cove II, respectively. This remeasurement resulted in a gain of $32 million recorded in Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2021. In October 2021, the Company amended the agreement, resulting in the reclassification of the previously contingent consideration assets to Prepaid Expenses. In December 2021, the Company acquired Community Energy, LLC (as further described above), and such remaining prepaid amounts were written off to Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

At closing, the Company made an initial cash payment of $44 million. The remainder was paid in the second and third quarter of 2021. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition; therefore, the total amount of consideration, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Ventus is reported in the South America SBU reportable segment.\nPenonome I - In May 2020, AES Panama completed the acquisition of the Penonome I wind farm from Goldwind International for $80 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, therefore the consideration transferred, plus transaction costs, was allocated to the individual assets and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values. Penonome I is reported in the MCAC SBU reportable segment.\n26. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the period. Potential common stock, for purposes of determining diluted earnings per share, includes the effects of dilutive RSUs, stock options, and equity units. The effect of such potential common stock is computed using the treasury stock method for RSUs and stock options, and is computed using the if-converted method for equity units.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share computation for income from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, where income represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator.\n194 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYear Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\n(in millions, except per share data) Loss Shares $ per Share Loss Shares $ per Share Income Shares $ per Share\nBASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to The AES Corporation common stockholders $ (546) 668 $ (0.82) $ (413) 666 $ (0.62) $ 43 665 $ 0.06\nEFFECT OF DILUTIVE SECURITIES\nStock options - - - - - - - 1 -\nRestricted stock units - - - - - - - 2 -\nEquity units - - - - - - - - -\nDILUTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE $ (546) 668 $ (0.82) $ (413) 666 $ (0.62) $ 43 668 $ 0.06\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the calculation of diluted earnings per share excluded 5 million outstanding stock awards and 40 million shares underlying our March 2021 Equity Units because their impact would be anti-dilutive given the loss from continuing operations. These shares could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future. Had the Company generated income, potential shares of common stock of 3 million and 4 million related to the stock awards and 40 million and 33 million related to the Equity Units, would have been included in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nAs described in Note 17-Equity, the Company issued 10,430,500 Equity Units in March 2021 with a total notional value of $1,043 million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and was initially issued as a Corporate Unit, consisting of a 2024 Purchase Contract and a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock. Prior to February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted at the option of the holder only in connection with a fundamental change. On and after February 15, 2024, the Series A Preferred Stock may be converted freely at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to the holder with respect to each share of Series A Preferred Stock being converted (i) a share of our Series B Preferred Stock, or, solely with respect to conversions in connection with a redemption, cash and (ii) shares of our common stock, if any, in respect of any conversion value in excess of the liquidation preference of the preferred stock being converted. The conversion rate is initially 31.5428 shares of common stock per one share of Series A Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $31.70 per share of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, due to customary anti-dilution provisions, the conversion rate was 31.5846, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $31.66 per share of common stock. The Series A Preferred Stock and the 2024 Purchase Contracts are being accounted for as one unit of account. In calculating diluted EPS, the Company has applied the if-converted method to determine the impact of the forward purchase feature and considered if there are incremental shares that should be included related to the Series A Preferred conversion value.\n27. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nAES is a diversified power generation and utility company organized into four market-oriented SBUs. See additional discussion of the Company's principal markets in Note 18-Segments and Geographic Information. Within our four SBUs, we have two primary lines of business: generation and utilities. The generation line of business uses a wide range of fuels and technologies to generate electricity such as coal, gas, hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. Our utilities business comprises businesses that transmit, distribute, and in certain circumstances, generate power. In addition, the Company has operations in the renewables area. These efforts include projects primarily in wind, solar, and energy storage.\nOperating and Economic Risks - The Company operates in several developing economies where macroeconomic conditions are typically more volatile than developed economies. Deteriorating market conditions and evolving industry expectations to transition away from fossil fuel sources for generation expose the Company to the risk of decreased earnings and cash flows due to, among other factors, adverse fluctuations in the commodities and foreign currency spot markets, and potential changes in the estimated useful lives of our thermal plants. Additionally, credit markets around the globe continue to tighten their standards, which could impact our ability to finance growth projects through access to capital markets. Currently, the Company has an investment grade rating from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch of BBB- and an investment grade rating from Moody's of Baa3. A downgrade in our current investment grade ratings could affect the Company's ability to finance new and/or existing development projects at competitive interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\n195 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nDuring 2022, 68% of our revenue was generated outside the U.S. and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. We continue to invest in several developing countries to expand our existing platform and operations. International operations, particularly the operation, financing, and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\neconomic, social, and political instability in any particular country or region;\ninability to economically hedge energy prices;\nvolatility in commodity prices;\nadverse changes in currency exchange rates;\ngovernment restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;\nunexpected changes in foreign laws, regulatory framework, or in trade, monetary or fiscal policies;\nhigh inflation and monetary fluctuations;\nrestrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas, or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;\nthreatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, similar organizations, or other counterparties to honor their commitments;\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts, or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and economically unfavorable to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;\ninability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative, and legal systems;\nadverse changes in government tax policy;\npotentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions;\ndifficulties in enforcing our contractual rights, enforcing judgments, or obtaining a just result in local jurisdictions; and\ninability to obtain financing on expected terms.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, our Latin American operations experience volatility in revenue and earnings which have caused and are expected to cause significant volatility in our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility is caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability, indexation of certain PPAs to fuel prices, and currency fluctuations being experienced in many of these countries. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.\nOur inability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any inability to obtain reasonable increases in tariffs or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly our utility businesses where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:\nchanges in the determination, definition, or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs;\nchanges in the definition or determination of controllable or noncontrollable costs;\nadverse changes in tax law;\nchanges in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;\nchanges in the timing of tariff increases;\nother changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions; or\nchanges in environmental regulations, including regulations relating to GHG emissions in any of our businesses.\n196 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nAny of the above events may result in lower margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic - The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global economic activity, including electricity and energy consumption, and caused significant volatility in financial markets.The magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time and may have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods.\nAlto Maipo - On August 27, 2021, Alto Maipo updated its creditors with respect to the construction budget and long-term business plan for the project, which considers different scenarios for spot prices, decarbonization initiatives, and hydrological conditions, among other significant variables. Under some of these scenarios, Alto Maipo may experience reduced future cash flows, which would limit its ability to repay debt. Alto Maipos management initiated negotiations with its creditors to restructure its obligations and achieve a sustainable long-term capital structure for Alto Maipo. On November 17, 2021, Alto Maipo SpA commenced a reorganization proceeding in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, through a voluntary petition. Consequently, after the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is no longer considered to have control over Alto Maipo, which resulted in its deconsolidation. The Company recognized an after-tax loss of approximately $1.2 billion, net of noncontrolling interests, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the fourth quarter of 2021, associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest.\nOn May 26, 2022, Alto Maipo emerged from bankruptcy in accordance with Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Alto Maipo, as restructured, is considered a VIE. As the Company lacks the power to make significant decisions, it does not meet the criteria to be considered the primary beneficiary of Alto Maipo and therefore will not consolidate this entity. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for its investment in Alto Maipo. If Alto Maipo is unable to meet its obligations under the restructured arrangements as they come due, the creditors may enforce their rights under the credit agreements. These finance agreements are non-recourse with respect to The AES Corporation.\nForeign Currency Risks - AES operates businesses in many foreign countries and such operations could be impacted by significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rate between the USD and the following currencies could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows: the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso, the Dominican peso, the Euro, the Indian rupee, and the Mexican peso.\nConcentrations - Due to the geographical diversity of its operations, the Company does not have any significant concentration of customers or sources of fuel supply. Several of the Company's generation businesses rely on PPAs with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant businesses' output over the term of the PPAs. However, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nThe cash flows and results of operations of our businesses depend on the credit quality of our customers and the continued ability of our customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under PPAs and fuel supply agreements. If a substantial portion of the Company's long-term PPAs and/or fuel supply were modified or terminated, the Company would be adversely affected to the extent that it would be unable to replace such contracts at equally favorable terms.\n28. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nCertain of our businesses in Panama and the Dominican Republic are partially owned by governments either directly or through state-owned institutions. In the ordinary course of business, these businesses enter into energy purchase and sale transactions, and transmission agreements with other state-owned institutions which are controlled by such governments. At two of our generation businesses in Mexico, the offtakers exercise significant influence, but not control, through representation on these businesses' Boards of Directors. These offtakers are also required to hold a nominal ownership interest in such businesses. Furthermore, in 2021, the Company began construction projects with Fluence relating to energy storage. These related party transactions primarily present themselves as construction in progress as seen below. Additionally, the Company provides certain support and management services to several of its affiliates under various agreements.\nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations included the following transactions with related parties for the periods indicated (in millions):\n197 | Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued) | December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nYears Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020\nRevenue-Non-Regulated $ 1,093 $ 1,159 $ 1,506\nCost of Sales-Non-Regulated 352 324 504\nInterest income 10 12 20\nInterest expense 95 88 131\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet accounts with related parties included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the periods indicated (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nReceivables from related parties $ 484 $ 131\nAccounts and notes payable to related parties (1)\n1,264 1,421\nConstruction in progress 714 134\n_____________________________\n(1)Includes $1 billion of debt to Mong Duong Finance Holdings B.V., an SPV accounted for as an equity affiliate as of December 31, 2022 (see Note 11-Debt).

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nThe Company carried out the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b), under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that as of December 31, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\nprovide reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements are prevented or detected timely.\nManagement, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls is subject to risks that those internal controls may become inadequate in future periods because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\") in 2013. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nThere were no changes that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n200 | 2022 Annual Report\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The AES Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The AES Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The AES Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 1, 2023\n201 | 2022 Annual Report ITEM 9B.

In 2008, an amendment to the Plan to provide an additional 12,000,000 shares was approved by AES' stockholders, bringing the total authorized shares to 29,000,000. In 2010, an additional amendment to the Plan to provide an additional 9,000,000 shares was approved by AES' stockholders, bringing the total authorized shares to 38,000,000. In 2015, an additional amendment to the Plan to provide an additional 7,750,000 shares was approved by AES' stockholders, bringing the total authorized shares to 45,750,000. The weighted average exercise price of Options outstanding under this plan included in Column (b) is $13.70 (excluding performance stock units, restricted stock units and director stock units), with 10,314,146 shares available for future issuance.\n(b)The AES Corporation Second Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation Plan for directors provided for 2,000,000 shares authorized for issuance.
