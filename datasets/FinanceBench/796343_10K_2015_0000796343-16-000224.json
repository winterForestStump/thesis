Across these markets, we help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in a streamlined workflow, and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anywhere, anytime.\nWhile we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth areas:\nDigital Media-providing tools, services and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. Our customers include content creators, web designers, app developers and digital media professionals, as well as management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents. This is the core of what we have delivered for over 25 years, and we have evolved our business model rapidly to provide these customers with a more complete and integrated workflow across the variety of new devices, formats and business models that continue to emerge.\nDigital Marketing-providing solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital advertising and marketing campaigns across multiple channels. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, marketing executives, information management executives, product development executives, and\nsales and support executives. We process over forty trillion data transactions a year via our SaaS products, providing our customers with analytics, social, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management and video solutions. This complements our digital media franchise, bringing together the art of creating and managing content with the science of measuring and optimizing it, enabling our customers to achieve their optimal business outcomes.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories, where our mission is to change the world through digital experiences. By integrating products from each of these two areas of Adobes business, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other entity currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of rich and engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers invest more to engage their constituents digitally.\nSEGMENTS\nOur business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. These segments provide Adobes senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around the companys two strategic growth opportunities described above, placing our Print and Publishing business in a third segment that contains many of our mature products and solutions.\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2016 and beyond for each of our segments. See Results of Operations within Part II, Item 7 titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further segment information.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVERVIEW\nDigital Media\nDigital Media Opportunity\nRecent trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Due to the increase in mobile computing, rich media consumed in digital environments and the rise of online social communities, the demand for digital media solutions to create engaging online experiences is higher than ever. Adobe is in a unique position to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering rapid innovation to increase our customer reach, deepen engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.\nThe flagship of our Digital Media business is Creative Cloud-a subscription service that allows members to download and install the latest versions of our creative products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and Adobe InDesign. Creative Cloud members can also access a growing marketplace of digital content through Adobe Stock, a leading online marketplace for photos, graphics and videos. Creative Cloud also offers members access to online services to sync, store, and share files, participate in our Behance community of more than five million creative professionals, publish and deliver digital content via app stores, develop mobile apps, and create and manage websites. Adobe is redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud so that our customers can obtain everything they need to create, collaborate and deliver engaging digital content.\nCreative Cloud addresses the needs of creative professionals including graphic designers, production artists, web designers and developers, user interface designers, videographers, motion graphic artists, prepress professionals, video game developers, mobile application developers, students and administrators. They rely on our solutions for publishing, web design and development, video and animation production, mobile app and gaming development and document creation and collaboration. End users of our creative tools work in businesses ranging from large publishers, media companies and global enterprises, to smaller design agencies, small and medium-sized businesses and individual freelancers. Moreover, our creative products are used to create much of the printed and online information people see, read and interact with every day, including video, animation, mobile and advertising content. Knowledge workers, educators, hobbyists and consumers also use our products to create and deliver creative content.\nIn addition to Creative Cloud, our Digital Media business offers many of the products included in Creative Cloud on a standalone basis, including subscriptions to the Creative Cloud version of certain point products, and also offers a range of other creative tools and services, including our hobbyist products such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements, Adobe Digital Publishing Solution (formerly Adobe Digital Publishing Suite), Adobe Typekit and mobile apps such as Adobe Photoshop Mix, Adobe Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Photoshop Fix and Adobe Premiere Clip that run on tablets and mobile devices. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under Principal Products and Services.\nAdobes Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud business, built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Acrobat Reader and a set of integrated cloud-based document services. For over twenty years, Adobe Acrobat has provided for the reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. Users can collaborate on documents with electronic comments and tailor the security of a file in order to distribute reliable Adobe PDF documents that can be viewed, printed or filled out utilizing our free Adobe Acrobat Reader. Acrobat provides essential electronic document capabilities and services to help knowledge workers accomplish a wide range of tasks ranging from simple publications and forms to mission-critical engineering documentation and architectural plans. With our Acrobat product and its innovative cloud services, we have extended the capabilities of our solution. Users can take advantage of electronic document signing with Adobe eSign (formerly EchoSign) and manage, track and control documents through Adobe Send & Track.\nDigital Media Strategy\nOur goal is to be the leading provider of tools and services that allow individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish and monetize their content anywhere.\nCreative Cloud, a subscription service with competitive monthly pricing, is attractive to users of older versions of our products who desire to use our latest releases and services, but who in the past have been unwilling to upgrade to newer versions due to price sensitivity. Similarly, as we gain new customers, we expect to continue to drive new user adoption of our creative business over the next several years outside of our core creative professional target market because of Creative Clouds attractive monthly subscription pricing combined with the strong brand of our creative products and the broad value proposition provided by Creative Cloud. We anticipate that our sustained focus on a subscription model will continue to increase the amount of our recurring revenue that is ratably reported, driven by broader Creative Cloud adoption over the next several years.\nTo accelerate the adoption of Creative Cloud, we have focused on migrating existing users of our creative products from perpetual licenses to a subscription-based offering, as well as driving new customer adoption. Aspects of this strategy include: focusing future innovation by our engineering teams on delivering new cloud-based functionality, such as Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe CreativeSync, to enable our customers to use our creative tools and services across a variety of devices in ways that are not possible with previous desktop versions; integrating Creative Cloud with our Adobe Stock online marketplace offerings; increasing the value of Creative Cloud by delivering frequent product updates and enhancements to subscribers to address their content creation challenges; using promotions to attract customers to the offering; expanding our go-to-market reach through channel partners to reach new customers; and utilizing Creative Cloud for teams and Creative Cloud for enterprise offerings to drive broad adoption with customers who license our products in volume.\nAs part of our Creative Cloud strategy, we utilize our digital marketing solutions to drive customer awareness of our creative products and increase sales of our products through our website and across other channels. Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the destination site where we engage individual and small business customers to sign up for and renew Creative Cloud subscriptions. We utilize channel partners to target mid-size creative customers with our Creative Cloud for teams offering. Our direct sales force is focused on building relationships with our largest customers and driving adoption of our Creative Cloud for enterprise offering.\nIn our Document Cloud business, although Acrobat has achieved strong market adoption in document-intensive industries such as government, financial services, pharmaceutical, legal, aerospace, insurance and technical publishing, we believe there are tens of millions of users who still need the capabilities provided by Acrobat. We plan to continue to market the benefits of our Document Cloud solutions, combined with the low entry point of subscription-based pricing, to individuals as well as small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises and government institutions around the world and increase our seat penetration in these markets through the utilization of our corporate and volume licensing programs. We also intend to increase our focus on marketing and licensing Acrobat in targeted vertical markets such as education, financial services, telecommunications and government, as well as on expanding into emerging markets, while simultaneously enhancing and building out the delivery of cloud-based document services to our Acrobat and Adobe Acrobat Reader users. We intend to continue to promote the capabilities of our cloud-based document solution, such as its integration with users Dropbox documents, to millions of Acrobat users and hundreds of millions of Adobe Acrobat Reader users. Our Adobe eSign services provide a green alternative to costly paper-based solutions, and are an easier way for customers to manage their contract workflows. We believe that by growing the awareness of eSign services in the broader contract delivery and signing market and continuing to add new capabilities to this offering, we can help our customers migrate away from paper-based express mailing and adopt our solution, growing our revenue with this business in the process.\nDigital Marketing\nDigital Marketing Opportunity\nConsumers today increasingly demand personalized content and experiences in their online interactions, across multiple channels and devices. As a result, any business or entity with an online presence must figure out how to best attract, engage, acquire and retain customers in a world where the reach and quality of experiences directly impacts success. Delivering the best experience\nto a consumer at a given moment requires the right combination of data, insights and content. Marketing executives are increasingly demanding solutions that optimize their consumers experiences and deliver the greatest return on their marketing spend so they can demonstrate the success of their programs using objective metrics.\nWe believe there is a significant opportunity to address these challenges and help customers transform their businesses. Chief Marketing Officers, digital marketers, advertisers and publishers are increasingly steering their marketing, advertising, and development budgets toward digital media. Many industry analysts predict more advertising dollars will be spent in digital than in traditional media in the future. As marketers make this move to digital, our opportunity is accelerating as customers look for vendors to help them navigate this transition. However, marketing in a digital world is not simply about executing campaigns in each digital channel. Marketers, and entire enterprises, also need to ensure they deliver meaningful experiences to their consumers across both digital and traditional channels and in areas such as sales, support, and product interactions where consumers expect experiences to be personalized.\nOur Digital Marketing business targets this large and growing opportunity by providing comprehensive solutions that include analytics, social marketing, targeting, media optimization, digital experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, premium video delivery and monetization. We deliver these capabilities through our Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated offering enabling marketers to measure, personalize and optimize marketing campaigns and digital experiences across channels for optimal marketing performance. With its broad set of solutions, including Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime, as well as real-time dashboards and a collaborative interface, customers of Adobe Marketing Cloud are able to combine data, insights and digital content to deliver a personalized brand experience to their consumers.\nIn addition to Chief Marketing Officers and digital marketers, users of our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions include marketing professionals such as search engine marketers, media managers, media buyers and marketing research analysts. Customers also include web content editors, web analysts and web marketing managers. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings and our video workflow and delivery technologies. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Marketing business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\nOur Digital Marketing segment also contains two legacy enterprise software offerings: our Adobe Connect web conferencing platform and Adobe LiveCycle, an enterprise document and forms platform. Since fiscal 2012, the focus of marketing and licensing of these products has been to financial services and government markets, driven by a subset of our enterprise sales force. We have also been focused on migrating some legacy LiveCycle customers to an updated offering with similar capabilities based on our Adobe Experience Manager solution.\nDigital Marketing Strategy\nOur goal is to be the leading provider of marketing solutions and a standard for the way digital advertising and marketing is created, measured, managed, executed and optimized.\nWe believe that our success will be driven by focusing our efforts on making Adobe Marketing Cloud the most comprehensive and integrated marketing solution available. Adobe Marketing Cloud consists of eight key solutions-Adobe Analytics, Adobe Target, Adobe Social, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime. Adobe Marketing Cloud provides marketers with key capabilities, such as the ability to:\nCombine data across the Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions and third-party data sources, such as customer relationship management, point of sale, email, and survey, to create a single view of the consumer;\nDeliver personalized customer experiences across channels and on any device;\nUse predictive analytics to enable marketers to utilize past marketing program data and success to predict and drive their future success with digital marketing programs;\nAccess all Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions from one centralized platform and visualize, socialize, and collaborate across teams with the interface;\nInteract with creatives through integration with Creative Cloud, enabling content creators and marketers to collaborate and communicate in real time within a cloud-based platform;\nAccurately forecast and continually optimize their mix of campaigns across digital media;\nProvide robust cross-channel campaign management capabilities utilizing real-time insights, rich customer data and a sophisticated automation and execution platform;\nManage, publish, track, and monetize social programs;\nStore, assemble, and distribute digital assets to deliver high-quality brand, campaign, and content experiences;\nBuild unique audience profiles, allowing marketers to identify their most valuable segments and use them across digital channels;\nEasily add, alter, and deploy marketing tags on websites, resulting in consistent page performance and accurate data collection; and\nIntegrate with a robust network of partners, covering the expansive digital marketing ecosystem.\nTo drive growth of Adobe Marketing Cloud, we also intend to streamline how customers learn about, acquire and deploy Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. We believe we can accelerate the growth of our business by continuing to build out more direct sales capacity, as well as continuing to enable a rich ecosystem of agencies and SIs who sell, implement and service our solutions. We believe these investments will result in continued growth in revenue in our Digital Marketing segment in fiscal 2016 and beyond.\nPrint and Publishing\nOur Print and Publishing segment contains legacy products and services that address diverse market opportunities including eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing. Graphics professionals and professional publishers continue to require quality, reliability and efficiency in production printing, and our Adobe PostScript and Adobe PDF printing technologies provide advanced functionality to meet the sophisticated requirements of this marketplace. As high-end printing systems evolve and transition to fully digital, composite workflows, we believe we are uniquely positioned to be a supplier of software and technology based on the PostScript and Adobe PDF standards for use by this industry.\nWe generate revenue by licensing our technology to OEMs that manufacture workflow software, printers and other output devices. In fiscal 2015, we maintained a relatively consistent quarterly revenue run-rate with the mature products we market and license in our Print and Publishing business.\nPRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nDigital Media Products\nCreative Cloud\nCreative Cloud is a subscription offering that enables the creation of rich and engaging digital content.

Competition in this market is also emerging with drawing and illustration applications on tablet and smartphone platforms. The demand for professional web page layout and professional web content creation tools is constantly evolving and highly volatile. In this area we face direct and indirect competition from desktop software companies and various proprietary and open source web-authoring tools.\nThe needs of digital imaging and video editing software users are constantly evolving due to rapid technology and hardware advancements in digital cameras, digital video cameras, printers, personal computers, tablets, smartphones and other new devices. Our imaging and video software offerings, including Photoshop, Lightroom, After Effects and Premiere Pro, face competition from established and emerging companies offering similar products.\nNew image editing applications for mobile devices and tablets with features that compete with our professional products are also emerging as adoption of these devices grows. Our consumer digital imaging and video editing offerings are subject to intense competition, including customer price sensitivity, competitor brand awareness and competitor strength in OEM bundling\nand retail distribution. We face direct and indirect competition in the consumer digital imaging market from a number of companies that market software that competes with ours.\nThe stock content market has significant competition, especially in the microstock segment, where Adobe primarily operates today with Fotolia.com and the newly launched Adobe Stock offering. Key competitors in this market include Shutterstock,Getty Images and a number of smaller companies. Adobe Stocks deep product integration with Creative Cloud and superior reach and relationships with creative professionals around the world differentiate our offerings.\nIn addition, we face competition from device, hardware and camera manufacturers as they try to differentiate their offerings by bundling, for free, their own digital imaging software, or those of our competitors. Similarly, we face potential competition from operating system manufacturers as they integrate or offer hobbyist-level digital imaging and image management features with their operating systems. We also face competition from smartphone and tablet manufacturers that integrate imaging and video software into their devices to work with cameras that come as part of their smartphone and tablet offerings. In addition, social networking platforms such as Facebook (including Instagram), Snapchat, Twitter (including Vine) and Pinterest, as well as portal sites such as Google and Yahoo! are becoming a direct means to post, edit and share images, bypassing the step of using image editing and sharing software. Online storage and synchronization are becoming free and ubiquitous. Consumers in particular will be encouraged to use the image and video editing software offered by those storage products, thus competing with our software.\nCompetition is also emerging with imaging and video applications on smartphone and tablet platforms. Competitors are extending their products and feature sets to platforms such as Apples iPhone and iPad, and other smartphone and tablet devices. Similarly, new cloud-based offerings continue to emerge which offer image editing and video-editing capabilities, as well as social and sharing features.\nAs customers such as publishers and media companies increase their desire to deliver their assets to new platforms, we expect new and existing companies to continue to offer solutions that address these challenges that are competitive with our Digital Publishing Solution. Many design agencies are building capabilities to offer such solutions, and companies such as Amazon, Apple and Google offer an alternative format and business model for the delivery of newspaper and magazine content to mobile devices.\nThe nature of traditional digital document creation, storage, and collaboration has been rapidly evolving as knowledge workers and consumers shift their behavior increasingly to non-desktop workflows. Competitors like Microsoft, Google, Box and Dropbox all offer competitive alternatives to our Document Cloud business for creating and managing PDFs. In addition, other PDF creation solutions can be found at a low cost or for free on the web. To address these competitive threats, we are working to ensure our Adobe Document Cloud applications stay at the forefront of innovation in emerging opportunities such as PDF document generation, document collaboration and document security.\nAs electronic signatures with Adobe eSign Services are quickly becoming a core element of digital documents, competitors such as DocuSign and Citrix have been jumping in to take advantage of the growing space. We face strong competition from these and other companies in this market.\nDigital Marketing\nThe markets in which our Digital Marketing business unit competes are growing rapidly and characterized by intense competition. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions face competition from large companies such as Google, IBM, Oracle, salesforce.com, SAP, SAS, Teradata and others, in addition to point product solutions and focused competitors. Additionally, new competitors are constantly entering these markets. Some of these competitors provide SaaS solutions to customers, generally through a web browser, while others provide software that is installed by customers directly on their servers. In addition, we compete at times with our customers or potential customers internally developed applications. Of the competitors listed above, no single company has products identical to our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud competes in a variety of areas, including: reporting and analytics; cross-channel marketing and optimization; online and social marketing; audience management; video delivery and monetization; web experience management and others.\nMany of the companies with which we compete offer a variety of products or services and as a result could also bundle their products or services, which may result in these companies effectively selling their products or services at or below market prices for individual products. In addition, large software, Internet and database management companies have expanded their offerings in the digital marketing area, either by developing competing services or by acquiring existing competitors or strategic partners of ours. We believe competitive factors in our markets include the proven performance, security, scalability, flexibility and reliability of services; the strategic relationships and integration with third-party applications; the intuitiveness and visual appeal of user interfaces; demonstrable cost-effective benefits to customers; pricing; the flexibility of services to match changing business demands; enterprise-level customer service and training; perceived market leadership; the usability of services; real-time data and reporting; independence from portals and search engines; the ability to deploy the services globally; and success in educating customers in how to utilize services effectively. We believe we compete favorably with both the enterprise and low-\ncost alternatives based on many of these competitive factors including our strong feature set, the breadth of our offerings, our focus on global, multi-brand companies, our superior user experience, tools for building multi-screen, cross-channel applications, standards-based architecture, scalability and performance and leadership in industry standards efforts.\nCreative and digital agencies, as well as SIs, are increasingly investing in acquiring their own digital marketing technology platforms to complement their creative services offerings. Adobe may face competition from these agencies and SIs as they come to market with best-of-breed offerings in one or more digital marketing capabilities, or if agencies attempt to create a more complete technology platform offering. We believe our creative tools heritage differentiates us from our competitors. We have worked closely with marketing and creative customers for over thirty years. We also believe we have leadership in this market, with current customers representing leading global brands. Our comprehensive solutions extend more broadly than any other company in serving the needs of marketers and addressing this market opportunity; we integrate content and data, analytics, personalization, web experience management, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization and social capabilities in our Adobe Marketing Cloud, surpassing the reach of any competitor. Most importantly, we provide a vision for our digital marketing customers as we engage with them across the important aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud, to how they manage, deliver, measure and monetize their content with our Adobe Marketing Cloud.\nPrint and Publishing\nOur Print and Publishing product offerings face competition from large-scale electronic and web publishing systems, XML-based publishing companies as well as lower-end desktop publishing products. Depending on the product line, competition is based on a number of factors, including: the quality and features of products, ease-of-use, printer service support, the level of customization and integration with other publishing system components, the number of hardware platforms supported, service and price. We believe we can successfully compete based upon the quality and features of our products, our strong brand among users, the widespread adoption of our products among printer service bureaus, and our extensive application programming interface.\nIn printing technologies, we believe the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities, market leadership, reliability, price, support and engineering development assistance. We believe that our competitive advantages include our technology competency, OEM customer relationships and our intellectual property portfolio.\nOPERATIONS\nMarketing and Sales\nWe market and license our products directly using our sales force and through our own website at www.adobe.com. We also market and distribute our products through sales channels, which include distributors, retailers, software developers, SIs, ISVs and VARs, as well as through OEM and hardware bundle customers.\nWe support our end users through local field offices and our worldwide distribution network, which includes locations in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nWe sell the majority of our products through a software subscription model where our customers purchase access to a product for a specific period of time during which they always have rights to use the most recent version of that product. We also license perpetual versions of our software with maintenance and support, which includes rights to upgrades, when and if available, support, updates and enhancements.\nFor fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no customers that represented at least 10% of net revenue. In fiscal 2015 and 2014, no single customer was responsible for over 10% of our trade receivables.\nOrder Fulfillment Distribution\nThe procurement of the various components of packaged products, including DVDs and printed materials, and the assembly of packages for retail and other applications products is controlled by our product delivery operations organization. We outsource our procurement, production, inventory and fulfillment activities to third parties in the United States, Germany and Singapore.\nTo date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials for the manufacture of our products or in the replication of DVDs, printing and assembly of components.\nOur evolution to a services and subscription-based business model has decreased the need to produce and distribute physical products. We still produce packaged products for a subset of our business, but that percentage is declining as the digital delivery of our services and subscriptions continues to grow.\nServices and Support\nAdobe Global Services provides expert consulting, customer success management, technical support, and training across all our customer segments, including enterprises, small and medium businesses, creative professionals, and consumers. With a focus on ensuring sustained customer success and realized value, this comprehensive portfolio of services is designed to help customers and partners maximize the return on their investments in our cloud solutions and licensed products.

Our professional services team uses a comprehensive, customer-focused methodology, that has been refined over years of capturing and analyzing best practices from numerous customer engagements across a diverse mix of solutions, industries, and customer segments.

Using our methodology, our professional services teams are able to accelerate customers time to value, and maximize the return customers earn on their investment in Adobe solutions.\nIn addition, Adobe Global Services focuses on its large and vibrant partner ecosystem that includes a mix of global SIs, regional SIs, VARs, digital agencies, and solution partners. Adobe invests in this ecosystem to ensure its partners have with the right skills and knowledge about our technologies and integration best practices. Consequently, this ecosystem provides our customers several different options to supplement their internal capabilities, and a large accessible pool of skilled resources that can help deploy and manage Adobe solutions. This approach not only creates value for our customers and partners, but also creates a large and productive go-to-market channel for our sales teams.\nCustomer Success Account Management\nFor our largest Digital Marketing and Digital Media customers, Adobe Global Services provides post-sales Customer Success Managers, who work individually with customers on an ongoing basis to understand their current and future business needs, promote faster solution adoption, and align solution capabilities to customers business objectives to maximize the return on their investment in Adobes solutions. We engage customers to share innovative best practices, relevant industry and vertical knowledge, and proven success strategies based on our extensive engagements with leading marketers and brands. The performance of these teams is directly associated with customer-focused outcomes, notably ongoing customer retention.\nTechnical Support\nAdobe provides enterprise maintenance and support services to customers of subscription products as part of the subscription entitlement, and to perpetual license customers via annual fee-based maintenance and support programs. These offerings provide:\ntechnical support on the products they have purchased from Adobe;\nhow to help in using our products; and\nproduct upgrades and enhancements during the term of the maintenance and support or subscription period, which is typically one to three years.\nWe provide product support through a global support organization that includes several regional and global support centers, supplemented with outsourced vendors for specific services. Customers can seek help through multiple channels including phone, chat, web, social media, and email, allowing quick and easy access to the information they need. These teams are responsible for providing timely, high-quality technical expertise on all our products.\nWe also offer a range of support programs, from fee-based incidents to annual support contract options. As a registered owner of the current version of an Adobe desktop product, consumers are eligible to receive Getting Started support on certain matters, to support easy adoption of their products. Support for some products and in some countries may vary. For enterprise customers with higher-level support needs, we offer personalized service options through Premium Services options, delivered by technical account managers who can also provide proactive risk mitigation services and on-site support services for those with business critical deployments.\nLastly, we also offer delivery assurance, technical support, and enablement services to partners and developer organizations. Through the Adobe Partner Connection Program, we provide developers with high-quality tools, software development kits, information and services.\nTraining Services\nAdobe Global Services offers a comprehensive portfolio of training services to assist our customer and partner teams in the use of our products, including those within Digital Marketing, Digital Media and other legacy products and solutions. Our training portfolio includes a large number of free online self-service learning options on www.training.adobe.com.

Adobe also provides a number of fee-based education options, including a wide range of traditional classroom, virtual, and on-demand training and certifications delivered by our team of training professionals and partners across the globe.\nThese core offerings are complemented by our custom learning and education services, such as our Digital Marketing Learning Center of Excellence, to support our largest enterprise customers and their unique requirements. Solution-specific Skills Assessments help our enterprise customers objectively assess the knowledge and competencies within their marketing teams, and tailor their learning priorities accordingly. Finally, aligned with our cloud strategy, we have introduced a new learning subscription service that enables customers to access all available Digital Marketing training over a 12-month period, to support the ongoing advancement of our customers marketing teams and skill sets.\nInvestments\nWe make direct investments in privately held companies. We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial returns as well as for strategic purposes as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as expand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services.\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\nAs the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required for the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We develop our software internally as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity that owned the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, typically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses were $862.7 million, $844.4 million and $826.6 million, respectively.\nPRODUCT PROTECTION\nWe regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. While we believe our patents have value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting segments. We protect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties only under limited circumstances and subject to specific security and confidentiality constraints. From time to time, we secure rights to third-party intellectual property if beneficial to our business.\nOur products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:\n(1)\nWe offer products on a right to use basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products to a designated number of devices, users or both. We also rely on copyright laws and on shrink wrap and electronic licenses that are not physically signed by the end user. Copyright protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries and the enforceability of shrink wrap and electronic licenses has not been conclusively determined in all jurisdictions.\n(2)\nWe offer products under a SaaS or on-demand model, where hosted software is provided on demand to customers, generally through a web browser. The use of these products is governed by either the online terms of use or an enterprise licensing agreement associated with the product.\nPolicing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult and software piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry. This problem is particularly acute in international markets. We conduct piracy conversion and prevention programs\ndirectly and through certain external software associations. In addition, we have activation technology in certain products to guard against illegal use and will continue to do so in certain future products.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of November 27, 2015, we employed 13,893 people. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available free of charge on our Investor Relations website at www.adobe.com/adbe as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

RISK FACTORS\nAs previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below. These and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\nThe process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and services. If we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate or respond to technological changes, the markets acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would suffer. Additionally, any delay in the development, production, marketing or offering of a new product or service or enhancement to an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline in our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. We maintain strategic relationships with third parties to market certain of our products and services and support certain product functionality. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and geographies or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.\nWe offer our products on a variety of personal computers, tablet and mobile devices. Recent trends have shown a technological shift from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. If we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile devices, our business could be harmed. To the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that significant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those platforms, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products to perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. These potential costs and delays could harm our business.\nIntroduction of new products, services and business models by competitors or others could harm our competitive position and results of operations.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers and frequent new product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower costs or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological developments, such as the evolution and emergence of digital application marketplaces as a direct sales and software delivery environment. These digital application marketplaces often have exclusive distribution for certain platforms, which may make it more difficult for us to compete in these markets. If any competing products, services or operating systems (that do not support our solutions) achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results could suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. Further consolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations.\nThe introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products. For example, some of our products rely on third-party cookies, which are placed on individual browsers when consumers visit websites that contain advertisements. We use these cookies to help our customers more effectively advertise, to gauge the performance of their advertisements, and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity. Consumers can block or delete cookies through their browsers or ad-blocking software\nor applications. The most common Internet browsers allow consumers to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being accepted by their browsers, or are set to block third-party cookies by default. Increased use of methods, software or applications that block cookies could harm our business.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate, see the section entitled Competition contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nIf we fail to successfully manage transitions to new business models and markets, our results of operations could suffer.\nWe often release new offerings and employ new product and services delivery methods in connection with our diversification into new business models and markets. It is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors. Market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to (1) include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and (2) optimally price our products and services in light of marketplace conditions, our costs and customer demand. New product and service offerings may increase our risk of liability related to the provision of services and cause us to incur significant technical, legal or other costs. For example, with our cloud-based services and subscription-based licensing models, such as Creative Cloud, we have entered markets that may not be fully accustomed to cloud-based subscription offerings. Market acceptance of such services is affected by a variety of factors, including information security, reliability, performance, customer preference, social and community engagement, local government regulations regarding online services and user-generated content, the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our products and services in certain geographies, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage its data, consumer concerns regarding data privacy and the enactment of laws or regulations that restrict our ability to provide such services to customers in the United States or internationally. If we are unable to respond to these threats, our business could be harmed.\nFrom time to time we open-source certain of our technology initiatives, provide broader open access to our technology, license certain of our technology on a royalty-free basis, or release selected technology for industry standardization. Additionally, customer requirements for open standards or open-source products could impact adoption or use of some of our products or services. To the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirements for such products or services, or if there is a delay in market acceptance of such products or services, our business could be harmed.\nWe also devote significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive, such as the marketplace for stock imagery. These new offerings and markets may require a considerable investment of technical, financial, compliance and sales resources, and a scalable organization. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their larger presence, larger developer network, deeper market experience and larger sales, consulting and marketing resources. In addition, the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge. If we are unable to successfully establish new offerings in light of the competitive environment, our results of operations could suffer.\nSubscription offerings and ETLAs could create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\nOur subscription model creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows. A portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period, but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription-based or hosted services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenue over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.\nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could affect our revenue, including longer than expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-element revenue arrangements and alternate licensing arrangements. If any of our assumptions about revenue from our new businesses or our addition of a subscription-based model prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected.\nUncertainty about current and future economic conditions and other adverse changes in general political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in economic and political conditions, both domestically and globally. Uncertainty about the effects of current and future economic and political\nconditions on us, our customers, suppliers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. If economic growth in countries where we do business slows, customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, advertising spending or marketing spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. Our customers include government entities, including the U.S. federal government, and if spending cuts impede the governments ability to purchase our products and services, our revenue could decline. Deterioration in economic conditions in any of the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable, which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nA financial institution credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers, including our distribution partners and channels. A disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners, on which we rely for operating cash management. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPolitical instability in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe increased emphasis on a cloud strategy may give rise to risks that could harm our business.\nOver the past several years, our business has shifted away from pre-packaged creative software to focus on a subscription model that prices and delivers our products and services in a way that differs from the historical pricing and delivery methods of our creative tools and document services products. These changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period. This cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operations, and may give rise to a number of risks, including the following:\nif customers desire only perpetual licenses or to purchase or renew subscriptions for specific products rather than acquire the entire Creative Cloud offering, our subscription sales may lag behind our expectations;\nour cloud strategy may raise concerns among our customer base, including concerns regarding changes to pricing over time, service availability, information security of a cloud solution and access to files while offline or once a subscription has expired;\ncustomers may turn to competitive or open-source offerings;\nwe may be unsuccessful in maintaining our target pricing, new seat adoption and projected renewal rates; or we may have to rely heavily on promotional rates to achieve target seat adoption, which could reduce average revenue per user; and\nwe may incur costs at a higher than forecasted rate as we expand our cloud operations.\nWe may be unable to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nThe hosted business model we utilize in our Adobe Marketing Cloud offerings typically involves selling services on a subscription basis pursuant to service agreements that are generally one to three years in length. Our individual Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription agreements are generally month-to-month or one year in length, ETLAs for our Digital Media products and services are generally three years in length, and subscription agreements for other products and services may provide for shorter or longer terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their initial subscription period, and some customers elect not to renew. We cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or licenses or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms of their agreements. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates. Our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline.\nOur future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers satisfaction with our products and services, the level of innovation reflected\nin those additional features, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows might decline.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in our products and systems could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claims.\nMaintaining the security of our products, computers and networks is a critical issue for us and our customers. Security researchers, criminal hackers and other third parties regularly develop new techniques to penetrate computer and network security measures and, as we have previously disclosed, certain parties have in the past managed to breach certain of our data security systems and misused certain of our systems and software in order to access our end users authentication and payment information. In addition, cyber-attackers also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, some of which may be specifically designed to attack our products, systems, computers or networks. Sophisticated hardware and operating system applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including bugs and other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system, or impair a customers ability to operate or use our products. The costs to prevent, eliminate or alleviate cyber- or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities are significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. It is impossible to predict the extent, frequency or impact of these problems on us.\nOutside parties have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or users of our products or services to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain physical access to our facilities in order to infiltrate our information systems. These actual and potential breaches of our security measures and the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our employees, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information. This may result in litigation and potential liability or fines, governmental inquiry or oversight or a loss of customer confidence, any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers and thereby requiring time and resources to repair our brand.\nThese problems affect our products and services in particular because cyber-attackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular offerings (such as those with a large user base), and we expect them to continue to do so. Critical vulnerabilities may be identified in certain of our applications. These vulnerabilities could cause such applications to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system, which could result in liability to us or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our products and services to customers. We devote significant resources to address security vulnerabilities through engineering more secure products, enhancing security and reliability features in our products and systems, code hardening, conducting rigorous penetration tests, deploying updates to address security vulnerabilities and improving our incident response time, but these security vulnerabilities cannot be totally eliminated. The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins, and we may be unable to implement these measures quickly enough to prevent cyber-attackers from gaining unauthorized access into our systems and products. Despite our preventative efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us (and have in the past led to such claims), and could lead some customers to seek to return products, to stop using certain services, to reduce or delay future purchases of products or services, or to use competing products or services. If we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology systems or if our systems become out-of-date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customers require, our business could be adversely affected. Customers may also adopt security measures designed to protect their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Further, if we or our customers are subject to a future attack, or our technology is utilized in a third-party attack, it may be necessary for us to take additional extraordinary measures and make additional expenditures to take appropriate responsive and preventative steps. Any of these events could adversely affect our revenue or margins. Moreover, delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from the disruptions of cyber-attacks or preventative measures could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.\nSome of our lines of business rely on us or our third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation.\nSome of our lines of business and services, including our online store at adobe.com, Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, other hosted Digital Media offerings and our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, rely on hardware and services hosted and controlled directly by us or by our third-party service providers. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. If our business relationship with a third-party provider of hosting or content delivery services is negatively affected, or if one of our content delivery suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted\nofferings to our customers, which could subject us to reputational harm and cause us to lose customers and future business, thereby reducing our revenue.\nWe hold large amounts of customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. A security incident at those facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data. Unauthorized access to customer data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers. Accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. Additionally, failure by customers to remove accounts of their own employees, or granting of accounts by the customer in an uncontrolled manner, may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representatives. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of personal information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the personal information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and harm our business.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage on behalf of our customers, it is possible that hardware or software failures or errors in our systems (or those of our third-party service providers) could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by a number of factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer websites. In addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports to our customers in near real time because of a number of factors, including significant spikes in customer activity on their websites or failures of our network or software. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of a company, division, product or technology, each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:\ndifficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\ndifficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies, products or services with our current technologies, products or services;\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration;\nentry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other employees from other opportunities and challenges;\ninability to retain personnel of the acquired business;\ninability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;\ninability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\ninability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits as a result of unforeseen difficulties in our integration activities;\nincurring acquisition-related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results;\npotential elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of the acquired business we assume;\npotential additional exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\npotential additional costs of bringing acquired companies into compliance with laws and regulations applicable to us as a multinational corporation;\npotential impairment of our relationships with employees, customers, partners, distributors or third-party providers of our technologies, products or services;\npotential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, including, but not limited to, issues with the acquired companys intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, data back-up and security (including security from cyber-attacks), privacy practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner issues or legal and financial contingencies;\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition, including, but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\nincurring significant exit charges if products or services acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful;\npotential inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;\npotential inability to obtain, or obtain in a timely manner, approvals from governmental authorities, which could delay or prevent such acquisitions;\nthe failure of strategic investments to perform as expected or to meet financial projections\npotential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings; and\npotential incompatibility of business cultures.\nMergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky. If we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated, and in certain circumstances an acquisition could harm our financial position.\nWe may incur substantial costs enforcing or acquiring intellectual property rights and defending against third-party claims as a result of litigation or other proceedings.\nIn connection with the enforcement of our own intellectual property rights, the acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights, or disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations and complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation are typically costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved many past lawsuits and other disputes, we may not prevail in every case in the future. Third-party intellectual property disputes, including those initiated by patent assertion entities, could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers, including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements. In addition, we may incur significant costs in acquiring the necessary third-party intellectual property rights for use in our products, in some cases to fulfill contractual obligations with our customers. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our business.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset. Infringement or misappropriation of assets in this portfolio can result in lost revenues and thereby ultimately reduce their value. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our intellectual property rights is inherently difficult. We actively combat software piracy as we enforce our intellectual property rights, but we nonetheless lose significant revenue due to illegal use of our software. If piracy activities continue at historical levels or increase, they may further harm our business.\nAdditionally, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets, including our source code. Despite these measures, as we have previously disclosed, hackers have managed to access certain of our source code and may obtain access in the future. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs through security breach, cyber-attack or otherwise, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could cause us to\nlose customers and could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. We also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non-disclosure agreements with our customers, contractors, vendors and partners. However, there is a risk that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization, and in these situations, enforcing our rights may be difficult or costly.\nIncreasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws and regulations could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability.\nOur industry is highly regulated, including for privacy and data security. We are also expanding our business in countries that have more stringent data protection laws than those in the United States, and such laws may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing interpretations. Privacy laws, including laws enforcing a right to be forgotten by consumers are changing and evolving globally. Governments, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New laws and industry self-regulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers, to understand how our products and services are being used, to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws, and to implement our new business models effectively. Any perception of our practices, products or services as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputational harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally, both laws regulating privacy, as well as third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns, could affect the functionality of and demand for our products and services, thereby harming our revenue.\nOn behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail, point of sale, text messaging and call centers. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information. Our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with such consumers expectations. We also rely on contractual representations made to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. We contractually obligate customers to represent to us that they provide their consumers the opportunity to opt out of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. We do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these representations are false or if our customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other regulatory action. In addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as Adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increased liability.\nIn the past we have relied on the U.S.-European Union and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU) and Switzerland as a means to legally transfer European personal information from Europe to the United States. However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. As a result, we have been establishing alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. The legitimacy of these alternate means are subject to differing interpretations among various European jurisdictions. The requirements or rulings of these jurisdictions may reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer services in certain locations, impact our customers ability to deploy our solutions in Europe, or subject us to sanctions, including fines and a prohibition on data transfers, by EU data protection regulators. Furthermore, the European Court of Justices decision may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. These developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure.\nBecause our products are distributed and used globally, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to process transactions effectively, our revenue and earnings may be harmed.\nWe process a significant volume of transactions on a daily basis in both our Digital Marketing and Digital Media businesses. Due to the size and volume of transactions that we handle, effective processing systems and controls are essential, but even the most sophisticated systems and processes may not be effective in preventing all errors. The systems supporting our business are comprised of multiple technology platforms that may be difficult to scale. If we are unable to effectively manage these systems and processes, we may be unable to process customer data in an accurate, reliable and timely manner, which may harm our customer relationships or results of operations.\nFailure to manage our sales and distribution channels and third-party customer service and technical support providers effectively could result in a loss of revenue and harm to our business.\nWe contract with a number of software distributors, none of which is individually responsible for a material amount of our total net revenue for any recent period. If any single agreement with one of our distributors were terminated, any prolonged delay in securing a replacement distributor could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nSuccessfully managing our indirect channel efforts to reach various customer segments for our products and services is a complex process across the broad range of geographies where we do business or plan to do business. Our distributors and other channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Notwithstanding the independence of our channel partners, we face potential legal risk and reputational harm from the activities of these third parties including, but not limited to, export control violations, workplace conditions, corruption and anti-competitive behavior. We cannot be certain that our distribution channel will continue to market or sell our products and services effectively. If our distribution channel is not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenue.\nOur distributors also sell our competitors products and services, and if they favor our competitors products or services for any reason, they may fail to market our products or services effectively or to devote resources necessary to provide effective sales, which would cause our results to suffer. We also distribute some products and services through our OEM channel, and if our OEMs decide not to bundle our applications on their devices, our results could suffer.\nIn addition, the financial health of our distributors and our continuing relationships with them are important to our success. Some of these distributors may be adversely impacted by changes to our business model or unable to withstand adverse changes in economic conditions, which could result in insolvency and/or the inability of such distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flows of our distributors who could, in turn, delay paying their obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure. Our business could be harmed if the financial condition of some of these distributors substantially weakened and we were unable to timely secure replacement distributors.\nWe also sell certain of our products and services through our direct sales force. Risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales and collection cycles associated with direct sales efforts, challenges related to hiring, retaining and motivating our direct sales force, and substantial amounts of training for sales representatives, including regular updates to cover new and upgraded systems, products and services. Moreover, recent hires may not become as productive as we would like, as in most cases it takes a significant period of time before they achieve full productivity. Our business could be seriously harmed if our expansion efforts do not generate a corresponding significant increase in revenue and we are unable to achieve the efficiencies we anticipate. In addition, the loss of key sales employees could impact our customer relationships and future ability to sell to certain accounts covered by such employees.\nWe also provide products and services, directly and indirectly, to a variety of government entities, both domestically and internationally. Risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include longer sales cycles, varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other government-specific contractual requirements. Ineffectively managing these risks could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as harm to our reputation.\nWe outsource a substantial portion of our customer service and technical support activities to third-party service providers. We rely heavily on these third-party customer service and technical support representatives working on our behalf, and we expect to continue to rely heavily on third parties in the future. This strategy provides us with lower operating costs and greater flexibility, but also presents risks to our business due to the fact that we may not be able to influence the quality of support as directly as we would be able to do if our own employees performed these activities. Our customers may react negatively to providing information to, and receiving support from, third-party organizations, especially if the third-party organizations are based overseas. If we encounter problems with our third-party customer service and technical support providers, our reputation may be harmed and we could lose customers and associated revenue.\nCertain of our enterprise offerings have extended and complex sales cycles.\nSales cycles for some of our enterprise offerings, including our Adobe Marketing Cloud Solutions and ETLAs in our Digital Media business, are multi-phased and complex. The complexity in these sales cycles is due to a number of factors, including:\nthe need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of our large-scale deployments of our products and services, including technical capabilities, security features, potential cost savings and return on investment;\nthe desire of large and medium size organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements prior to making information technology expenditures;\nthe need for our representatives to spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services;\nthe negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts, as often required by our and our customers business and legal representatives;\nthe need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations; and\ncustomer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.\nWe spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without any assurance that potential customers will ultimately purchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and could have a greater impact on our results of operations. Additionally, our enterprise sales pattern has historically been uneven, where a higher percentage of a quarters total sales occur during the final weeks of each quarter, which is common in our industry. Our extended sales cycle for these products and services makes it difficult to predict when a given sales cycle will close.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nWe are a highly automated business and rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems and our website for our development, marketing, operational, support, hosted services and sales activities. In addition, some of our businesses rely on third-party hosted services, and we do not control the operation of third-party data center facilities serving our customers from around the world, which increases our vulnerability. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, certain of our data centers and certain other critical business operations are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, and additional facilities where we conduct significant operations are located in the Salt Lake Valley Area, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nAccess to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices or for our vendors, is a priority. Our major sites in California and India are vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change. While we seek to partner with organizations that mitigate their business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent risks wherever business is conducted. In the event of a natural disaster that disrupts business due to limited access to these resources, Adobe has the potential to experience losses to our business, time required to recover, and added costs to resume operations.\nAdditionally, climate change may pose regulatory and environmental challenges that affect where we locate our offices, who we partner with, and how we deliver products and services to our customers.\nNet revenue, margin or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nThe market price for our common stock has in the past experienced significant fluctuations and may do so in the future. A number of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:\nshortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, the number of paid Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscribers, Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), bookings within our Adobe Marketing Cloud business or other key performance metrics;\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\nwhether our results meet analysts expectations\nthe announcement of new products and services, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;\nthe loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new customers;\nvariations in our or our competitors results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and developments in our industry; and\nunusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory, political or market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nWe are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, privacy practices, data residency, corporate governance, employee and third-party complaints, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in U.S. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the United States. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We cannot provide assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our internal policies. Any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe face various risks associated with our operating as a multinational corporation.\nAs a global business that generates approximately 42% of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the Americas, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\nforeign currency fluctuations;\nchanges in government preferences for software procurement;\ninternational and regional economic, political and labor conditions, including any instability or security concerns abroad;\ntax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries);\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\nunexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements;\nchanges in laws governing the free flow of data across international borders;\nfailure of laws to protect our intellectual property rights adequately;\ninadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\ndelays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers;\nthe imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;\noperating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices; and\nother factors beyond our control, including terrorism, war, natural disasters and pandemics.\nIf sales to any of our customers outside of the Americas are delayed or canceled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may decline.\nIn addition, approximately 53% of our employees are located outside the United States. Accordingly, we are exposed to changes in laws governing our employee relationships in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including laws and regulations regarding wage and hour requirements, fair labor standards, employee data privacy, unemployment tax rates, workers compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll and other taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. We may continue to expand our international operations and international sales and marketing activities. Expansion in international markets has required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may be unable to scale our infrastructure effectively or as quickly as our competitors in these markets, and our revenue may not increase to offset these expected increases in costs and operating expenses, which would cause our results to suffer.\nWe have issued $1.9 billion of notes in debt offerings and may incur other debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nWe have $1.9 billion in senior unsecured notes outstanding. We also have a $1 billion revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn. This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things:\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing.\nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls.\nFor example, the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow GAAP under SEC regulations and those who are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards outside of the United States. These efforts by the FASB and IASB may result in different accounting principles under GAAP that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting. Additionally, significant changes to GAAP\nresulting from the FASBs and IASBs efforts may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.\nIt is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective, whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in or our interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the EU and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIf we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service, availability and performance of our senior management. These individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to Adobe. The loss of any of these individuals could harm our business, especially in the event that we have not been successful in developing adequate succession plans. Our business is also dependent on our ability to retain, hire and motivate talented, highly skilled personnel across all levels of our organization. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense in many areas where our employees are located. If we are unable to continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel, our business may be harmed. Effective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions of our key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.\nOur investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the financial markets.\nOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015 consisted of corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, money market mutual funds, municipal securities, time deposits and asset-backed securities. We follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes.\nShould financial market conditions worsen in the future, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns. In addition, any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations. As of November 27, 2015, we had no material impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio, and although we believe our current investment portfolio has little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity, or credit availability, and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe following table sets forth the location, approximate square footage and use of each of the principal properties used by Adobe during fiscal 2015. We lease or sublease all of these properties with the exception of our property in Noida, India where we own the building and lease the land, in Lehi where we own the building and land, in San Francisco at 601 and 625 Townsend Street where we own the building and land, and our corporate offices in San Jose where we own the land and the East and West tower buildings and lease the Almaden Tower building. All leased properties are leased under operating leases. Such leases expire at various times through 2028, with the exception of our land lease in Noida, India that expires in 2091. The annual base rent expense (including operating expenses, property taxes and assessments, as applicable) for all leased facilities is currently approximately $87.3 million and is subject to annual adjustments as well as changes in interest rates.\nLocation\nApproximate\nSquare\nFootage\nUse\nNorth America:\nWest Tower, 345 Park Avenue\nSan Jose, CA 95110, USA\n391,000\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\nEast Tower, 321 Park Avenue\nSan Jose, CA 95110, USA\n325,000\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\nAlmaden Tower, 151 Almaden Boulevard\nSan Jose, CA 95110, USA\n273,000\nProduct development, sales and administration\n601 and 625 Townsend Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94103, USA\n346,000\n(1)\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\n801 N. 34th Street-Waterfront\nSeattle, WA 98103, USA\n182,000\n(2)\nProduct development, sales, technical support and administration\n410 Townsend Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n47,000\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\n3900 Adobe Way\nLehi, UT 84043, USA\n257,000\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\n7930 Jones Branch Drive\nMcLean, VA 22102, USA\n34,000\n(3)\nSales and marketing\n1540 Broadway\nNew York, NY 10036, USA\n55,000\nSales and marketing\n343 Preston Street\nOttawa, Ontario K1S 5N4, Canada\n122,000\n(4)\nResearch, product development, sales, marketing and administration\n25100 NW Evergreen Rd\nHillsboro, OR 97124, USA\n85,000\nData center\nIndia:\nAdobe Towers, 1-1A, Sector 25A\nNoida, U.P.\n191,000\nProduct development and administration\nLocation\nApproximate\nSquare\nFootage\nUse\nTech Boulevard, Plot #6, Sector 127\nExpressway, Noida, U.P.\n107,000\nProduct development and administration\nPlot A3, A4 & A5, Sector 125\nNoida, U.P.\n63,000\nProduct development and administration\nSalapuria Infinity\n#5 and #6 Bannerghatta Road,\nBangalore\n185,000\n(5)\nResearch, product development and administration\nPrestige Platina Technology Park\nBuilding 1, Block A\nBangalore\n250,000\n(5)\nResearch, product development and administration\nJapan:\nGate City Osaki East Tower\n1-11 Osaki\nShinagawa-ku, Tokyo\n56,000\nProduct development, sales and marketing\nRomania:\n26 Z Timisoara Blvd, Anchor Plaza\nLujerului, Sector 6\nBucharest\n71,000\nResearch and product development\nUK:\nMarket House Providence Place\nMaidenhead, Berkshire, SL6 8AD\n49,000\nProduct development, sales, marketing and administration\nGermany:\nGrosse Elbstrasse 27\nHamburg\n36,000\nResearch and product development\nGeorg-Brauchle-Ring No. 56/58\nMunich\n39,000\nSales, marketing and administration\nFrance:\n18 rue Roger Simon-Barboux\nArcueil, France\n28,000\nProduct development, sales and administration\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nThe total square footage is 346,000, of which we occupy 273,000 square feet, or approximately 79% of this facility; 74,000 square feet is unoccupied basement space.\n(2)\nThe total square footage is 182,000, of which we occupy 162,000 square feet, or approximately 89% of this facility.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nIn connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.\nBetween May 4, 2011 and July 14, 2011, five putative class action lawsuits were filed in Santa Clara Superior Court and Alameda Superior Court in California. On September 12, 2011, the cases were consolidated into In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation (HTEAL) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. In the consolidated complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Adobe, along with Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar, agreed not to recruit each others employees in violation of Federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintiffs claim the alleged agreements suppressed employee compensation and deprived employees of career opportunities. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. All defendants deny the allegations and that they engaged in any wrongdoing of any kind. On October 24, 2013, the court certified a class of all persons who worked in the technical, creative, and/or research and development fields on a salaried basis in the United States for one or more of the following: (a) Apple from March 2005 through December 2009; (b) Adobe from May 2005 through December 2009; (c) Google from March 2005 through December 2009; (d) Intel from March 2005 through December 2009; (e) Intuit from June 2007 through December 2009; (f) Lucasfilm from January 2005 through December 2009; or (g) Pixar from January 2005 through December 2009, excluding retail employees, corporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of all defendants. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation. In March 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and on September 2, 2015, the court granted final approval of the settlement. We expect to incur no additional losses associated with this matter.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\nIn connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information for Common Stock\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADBE.

Because many of such shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.\nDividends\nWe did not declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock during fiscal 2015 or fiscal 2014. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nBelow is a summary of stock repurchases for the three months ended November 27, 2015.

The new stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors is similar to our previous $2 billion repurchase program.\n(2)\nIn September 2015, as part of our stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $125.0 million. As of November 27, 2015, approximately $38.2 million of the prepayment remained under this agreement. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nThe following selected consolidated financial data (presented in thousands, except per share amounts and employee data) is derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nACQUISITIONS\nDuring fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology for $616.7 million, and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work for $111.1 million. During fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital Media reportable segments, respectively.\nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, perpetual and time-based software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.\nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (BESP), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nProduct revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nIn the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report.\nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition\ndate. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\nfuture expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\nexpected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;\nthe acquired companys trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and\ndiscount rates.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company has significant historical data on their employees exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired companys history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\nWe completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined there was no impairment. The results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their carrying values.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic\ntax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS of our fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax returns. We expect future examinations to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of any of these examinations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings.\nOur income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nWith the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of 2015\nFor fiscal 2015, we reported financial results consistent with the continued execution of our long-term plans for our two strategic growth areas, Digital Media and Digital Marketing, while continuing to market and license a broad portfolio of products and solutions.\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Adobe Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud, first delivered in May 2012, is our next-generation offering that supersedes our historical model of licensing our creative products with perpetual licenses. Creative Cloud delivers value through more frequent product updates, storage and access to user files stored in the cloud with syncing of files across users' machines, access to marketplace, social and community-based features with our Adobe Stock and Behance services, app creation capabilities and lower entry point pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals and for teams, and we enable larger enterprise customers to acquire Creative Cloud capabilities through Enterprise Term License Agreements (ETLAs). The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple routes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our business model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers, most notably with our acquisition of Fotolia in January of 2015, to enable the delivery and purchase of stock assets in our new service called Adobe Stock. Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new customers, and shift our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offering. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive such as offering new mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and ETLAs, perpetual revenue for older Creative products has continued to decline, and revenue from perpetual licensing of these products was immaterial for fiscal 2015.\nWe are also a market leader with our Document Cloud offerings built around our Acrobat family of products, the Adobe Reader DC and a set of integrated cloud-based document services, including Adobe eSign. Adobe Acrobat provides reliable creation and exchange of electronic documents, regardless of platform or application source type. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered the next generation of this offering called Adobe Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices. Adobe Document Cloud includes all-new Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe eSign releases and a set of integrated services enable users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Acrobat DC, with a touch-enabled user interface, is licensed both through subscription and perpetual pricing.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) is currently our key performance metric to assess the health and trajectory of our overall Digital Media segment. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue, deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We plan to adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material exchange rates changes. We calculate ARR as follows:\nCreative ARR\nAnnual Value of Creative Cloud Subscriptions and Services\n+\nAnnual Digital Publishing Suite Contract Value\n+\nAnnual Creative ETLA Contract Value\nDocument Cloud ARR\nAnnual Value of Document Cloud Subscriptions and Services\n+\nAnnual Document Cloud ETLA Contract Value\nDigital Media ARR\nCreative ARR\n+\nDocument Cloud ARR\nTotal Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2015 was $2.60 billion, up from $1.61 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. We exited fiscal 2015 with 6.167 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 78% from 3.458 million at the end of fiscal 2014.\nOur Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud products and solutions, including our newly released Acrobat DC product which helped grow Document Cloud ARR to $397 million exiting fiscal 2015, up from $265 million at the end of fiscal 2014.\nTotal Digital Media ARR grew to approximately $3.00 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, up from $1.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2015 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2015 and held constant throughout the year. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2015 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2016, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2015 would be $2.88 billion or approximately $114 million lower than the ARR reported above.\nWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud now includes eight solutions which address the expanding needs of marketers. In fiscal 2015, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion, which represents 16% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition, we drove strong demand and bookings growth for our Marketing Cloud solutions, which we expect will positively benefit revenue growth in future quarters.\nFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2015\nDuring fiscal 2015, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 67% from 50% compared with fiscal 2014, as we transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.\nTotal Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.00 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $1.12 billion, or 60%, from $1.88 billion as of November 28, 2014. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and continued adoption of our ETLAs, and to a lesser extent, the adoption of our Document Cloud offering through our ETLAs and increases in Document Cloud subscriptions.\nAdobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion increased by $188.5 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2015, from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) offering and increases in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics revenue.\nOur total deferred revenue of $1.49 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $330.0 million, or 29%, from $1.16 billion as of November 28, 2014, primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, ETLAs and new contracts and existing renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Also contributing to the increase in deferred revenue were the increases associated with our stock photography offering from the acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.\nCost of revenue of $744.3 million increased by $122.2 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2015, from $622.1 million in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and costs of professional services driven by the increase in our professional services business.\nOperating expenses of $3.15 billion increased by $35.8 million during fiscal 2015, from $3.11 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase is due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and amortization of intangibles from the Fotolia acquisition in fiscal 2015.\nNet income of $629.6 million increased by $361.2 million, or 135%, during fiscal 2015 from $268.4 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to revenue growth.\nNet cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion during fiscal 2015 increased by $182.0 million, or 14%, from $1.29 billion during fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net income.\nRevenue (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nSubscription\n$\n3,223.9\n$\n2,076.6\n$\n1,137.9\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nProduct\n1,125.1\n1,627.8\n2,470.1\n(31\n)%\n(34\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nServices and support\n446.5\n442.7\n447.2\n%\n(1\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,795.5\n$\n4,147.1\n$\n4,055.2\n%\n%\nOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud services. We recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of the service. We expect our subscription revenue will continue to increase as a result of our investments in new software-as-a-service (SaaS) and subscription models.\nWe have the following reportable segments-Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. Subscription revenue by reportable segment for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 is as follows (dollars in millions):\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nDigital Media\n$\n2,264.7\n$\n1,268.3\n$\n471.9\n%\n%\nDigital Marketing\n937.0\n797.5\n663.1\n%\n%\nPrint and Publishing\n22.2\n10.8\n2.9\n*\n*\nTotal subscription revenue\n$\n3,223.9\n$\n2,076.6\n$\n1,137.9\n%\n%\n_________________________________________\n(*)\nPercentage is not meaningful.\nOur services and support revenue is comprised of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products and the sale of our hosted Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nSegments\nIn fiscal 2015, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:\nDigital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents.\nDigital Marketing-Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officers and chief revenue officers.\nPrint and Publishing-Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses.\nSegment Information (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nDigital Media\n$\n3,095.2\n$\n2,603.2\n$\n2,625.9\n%\n(1\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nDigital Marketing\n1,508.9\n1,355.2\n1,228.8\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nPrint and Publishing\n191.4\n188.7\n200.5\n%\n(6\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,795.5\n$\n4,147.1\n$\n4,055.2\n%\n%\nFiscal 2015 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2014 Revenue\nDigital Media\nRevenue from Digital Media increased $492.0 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by increases in revenue associated with our creative offerings due to continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud. Document Cloud revenue remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nCreative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud and perpetual creative offerings, increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, primarily due to the increase in subscription revenue associated with our Creative Cloud offerings driven by the increase in number of paid Creative Cloud team, individual and enterprise subscriptions. The increases associated with our creative products were offset in part by expected declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings.\nDocument Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to the year ago period, as increases in revenue associated with eSign and our Document Cloud subscription offering were offset by decreases in revenue associated with our Document Cloud perpetual license offerings. Driving the increase in our Document Cloud subscription revenue was the adoption of our cloud offering through subscriptions and ETLAs.\nDigital Marketing\nRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $153.7 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 16% as compared with the year-ago period. Contributing to this increase was the continued adoption of our AEM term-based offering, and to a lesser extent, increases in revenue associated with Adobe Campaign, Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target.\nPrint and Publishing\nRevenue from Print and Publishing remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nFiscal 2014 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2013 Revenue\nDigital Media\nRevenue from Digital Media decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The slight decrease was primarily driven by declines in revenue associated with our perpetual creative offerings, distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. With respect to the Hobbyist product revenue decline, we began actively migrating customers to our Creative Cloud Photography Plan in fiscal 2014, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Largely offsetting these decreases were increases in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud revenue.\nCreative revenue, which includes our Creative Cloud, Creative Suite editions and CS point products, decreased slightly during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to decreases in revenue from CS point products and Creative Suite editions, as we discontinued the general availability of our perpetually licensed CS6 products in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. Also contributing to the decline in creative revenue were decreases in revenue associated with the distribution of third-party software downloads and Hobbyist products launched in fiscal 2013. Decreases were largely offset by increases in revenue from subscriptions and ETLAs and revenue from our Digital Publishing Suite.\nDocument Cloud revenue, which includes our Acrobat product family, increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to increases in our Document Cloud subscription revenue. Increases were slightly offset by decreases due to our continued shift to ETLAs.\nDigital Marketing\nRevenue from Digital Marketing increased $126.3 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to continued revenue growth associated with our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which increased 15% during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Contributing to this increase was Adobe Campaign and the strong adoption of AEM.\nPrint and Publishing\nRevenue from Print and Publishing decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in legacy product revenue and increased ETLAs for certain products in this group.\nGeographical Information (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nAmericas\n$\n2,788.1\n$\n2,314.4\n$\n2,134.4\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nEMEA\n1,336.4\n1,179.9\n1,129.2\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nAPAC\n671.0\n652.8\n791.6\n%\n(18\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal revenue\n$\n4,795.5\n$\n4,147.1\n$\n4,055.2\n%\n%\nFiscal 2015 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography\nRevenue increased in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 while revenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 compared with the year-ago period. Revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. The overall increase in EMEA revenue was slightly offset by declines due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA currencies in fiscal 2015. Within the Americas and EMEA, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.\nRevenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue.The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nFiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2013 Revenue by Geography\nOverall revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Revenue in the Americas increased due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Marketing revenue. Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue in EMEA remained relatively stable. Despite strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound during the latter part of fiscal 2014, the overall weakening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in EMEA to increase as compared to fiscal 2013. Within the Americas and EMEA, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above.\nRevenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in Digital Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies. Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing revenue in APAC remained relatively stable during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013.\nIncluded in the overall change in revenue for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 were impacts associated with foreign currency as shown below. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue.\n(in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nRevenue impact:\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nEMEA:\nEuro\n$\n(104.3\n)\n$\n12.3\nBritish Pound\n(16.1\n)\n12.9\nOther currencies\n(12.3\n)\n(0.2\n)\nTotal EMEA\n(132.7\n)\n25.0\nJapanese Yen\n(35.0\n)\n(25.7\n)\nOther currencies\n(23.9\n)\n(8.9\n)\nTotal revenue impact\n(191.6\n)\n(9.6\n)\nHedging impact:\nEMEA\n40.1\n10.1\nJapanese Yen\n16.2\n8.6\nTotal hedging impact\n56.3\n18.7\nTotal impact\n$\n(135.3\n)\n$\n9.1\nDuring fiscal 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in EMEA and APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease as compared to fiscal 2014. These decreases were partially offset by hedging gains from our EMEA currencies and Japanese Yen hedging programs during fiscal 2015.\nDuring fiscal 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies causing revenue in APAC measured in U.S. Dollar equivalents to decrease compared to fiscal 2013. This decrease was offset in part by the favorable impact to revenue measured in EMEA currencies as the U.S. Dollar weakened against the Euro and the British Pound for the majority of fiscal 2014. Our EMEA and Yen currency hedging programs resulted in hedging gains during fiscal 2014.\nSee Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further geographic information.\nProduct Backlog\nThe actual amount of product backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal shippable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. We expect that our shippable backlog will continue to be insignificant in future periods.\nDeferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year, non-cancelable commercial subscription agreements or government contracts with fiscal funding clauses. Unbilled deferred revenue represents expected future billings which are contractually committed under our existing subscription, SaaS and managed services agreements that have not been invoiced and are not recorded in deferred revenue within our financial statements. Our presentation of unbilled deferred revenue backlog may differ from that of other companies in the industry. As of November 27, 2015, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.89 billion of which approximately 40% to 50% is not reasonably expected to be billed during fiscal 2016. As of November 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.19 billion, which has been updated to include $433 million of individual annual subscriptions which were not captured in the prior year due to current year enhancements to our management reporting system.\nWe expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, including the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles of these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes in customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior to renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.\nCost of Revenue (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nSubscription\n$\n409.2\n$\n335.5\n$\n278.1\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nProduct\n90.0\n97.1\n138.2\n(7\n)%\n(30\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nServices and support\n245.1\n189.5\n170.3\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n744.3\n$\n622.1\n$\n586.6\n%\n%\nSubscription\nCost of subscription revenue consists of third-party royalties and expenses related to operating our network infrastructure, including depreciation expenses and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment, data center costs, salaries and related expenses of network operations, implementation, account management and technical support personnel, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. We enter into contracts with third parties for the use of their data center facilities and our data center costs largely consist of amounts we pay to these third parties for rack space, power and similar items.\nCost of subscription revenue increased due to the following:\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nData center cost\n%\n%\nCompensation cost and related benefits associated with headcount\nDepreciation expense\nRoyalty cost\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n-\nVarious individually insignificant items\nTotal change\n%\n%\nCost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to data center costs, compensation and related benefits, royalty cost, depreciation expense, and purchased intangible amortization. Data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures in recent periods as we continue to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our subscription and hosted services business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings and increased royalties due to the introduction of our stock photography offering from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015. Amortization of purchased intangibles increased primarily due to amortization of intangibles acquired from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.\nCost of subscription revenue increased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to data center costs, compensation and related benefits, depreciation expense, and royalty cost. Data center costs increased primarily due to higher transaction volumes in our Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud services. Compensation cost and related benefits increased primarily due to additional headcount in fiscal 2014, including from our acquisition of Neolane in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Depreciation expense increased primarily due to higher capital expenditures as we continued to invest in our network and data center infrastructure to support the growth of our business. Royalty cost increased primarily due to increases in subscriptions and downloads of our SaaS offerings.\nProduct\nCost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs, purchased intangibles and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products.\nFluctuations in cost of product revenue are due to the following:\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nCost of sales\n(3\n)%\n(4\n)%\nExcess and obsolete inventory\n(4\n)\nAmortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements\n(2\n)\n(20\n)\nRoyalty cost\n(2\n)\nVarious individually insignificant items\n(1\n)\n(5\n)\nTotal change\n(7\n)%\n(30\n)%\nCost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in excess and obsolete inventory, cost of sales and amortization of purchased intangibles, partially offset by an increase in royalty cost. The increase in royalty cost was driven by royalty payments related to our stock photography perpetual offering from our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.\nCost of product revenue decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreases in amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements, cost of sales and royalty cost, slightly offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements decreased as we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements for which payments of $26.5 million related to historical use of certain technology licensing arrangements were expensed as cost of product revenue during fiscal 2013. Cost of sales decreased due to decreases in the number of perpetual units sold and associated packaging costs as we continued to focus our development and sales efforts on Creative Cloud. Royalty cost decreased primarily due to decreases in revenue from our perpetual offerings. Excess and obsolete inventory increased as a result of changes in reserve requirements for CS6 shrink boxes as we discontinued the general availability of CS6 on a perpetual licensing basis.\nServices and Support\nCost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support.\nCost of services and support revenue increased in all periods presented due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and third-party fees to support the increase in our professional services business.\nOperating Expenses (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nResearch and development\n$\n862.7\n$\n844.4\n$\n826.6\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nSales and marketing\n1,683.2\n1,652.3\n1,620.5\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n531.9\n543.3\n520.1\n(2\n)%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nRestructuring and other charges\n1.6\n19.9\n26.5\n*\n(25\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n**\n**\n%\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n68.7\n52.4\n52.3\n%\n-\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n3,148.1\n$\n3,112.3\n$\n3,046.0\n%\n%\n_________________________________________\n(*) Percentage is not meaningful.\n(**) Percentage is less than 1%.\nResearch and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses\nResearch and development and sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the reversal of a previously anticipated loss associated with the HTEAL proceedings, offset in part by increases in compensation and related benefits associated with headcount.\nThe increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases in cash incentive and stock-based compensation. The increase in stock-based compensation was driven by a change in the vesting term for stock awards granted as part of our annual review process beginning in fiscal 2013, which decreased the term from four years to three years. The increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to compensation and related benefits associated with additional headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development.\nResearch and development expenses increased due to the following:\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nCompensation and related benefits associated with headcount\n%\n-\n%\nCompensation associated with cash and stock-based incentives\n(1\n)\nVarious individually insignificant items\n-\nTotal change\n%\n%\nWe believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products, subscription and solution offerings. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our application, tool, subscription and service offerings.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs.\nSales and marketing expenses increased due to the following:\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nCompensation and related benefits associated with headcount\n%\n%\nCompensation associated with cash incentives\n(2\n)\n-\nProfessional and consulting fees\n(2\n)\n-\nMarketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts\n-\nVarious individually insignificant items\nTotal change\n%\n%\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel.

See Note 15 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the HTEAL proceedings.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015, we considered all our restructuring plans to be substantially complete. We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial credits and charges to our restructuring plans.\nDuring fiscal 2014, in connection with our Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan, we recorded $19.4 million associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities. In connection with our Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded insignificant charges associated with closing redundant facilities.\nDuring fiscal 2013, we sold land, building and other assets located in Waltham, Massachusetts for net proceeds of $24.3 million. Because the total carrying amount of these assets was $47.4 million at the time it was classified as held for sale, we recorded a write-down of $23.1 million during fiscal 2013.\nAlso during fiscal 2013, in connection with our Fiscal 2011 Restructuring Plan and Other Restructuring Plans, we recorded immaterial charges and credits associated with termination benefits and closing redundant facilities during the fiscal year.\nSee Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles\nDuring the last several years, we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions. As a result of these acquisitions, we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to fourteen years.\nAmortization expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015, partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of Efficient Frontier and Day Software Holding AG that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal 2014.\nAmortization expense remained stable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nInterest and other income (expense), net\n$\n33.9\n$\n7.3\n$\n4.9\n*\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n**\n**\n**\nInterest expense\n(64.2\n)\n(59.7\n)\n(67.5\n)\n%\n(12\n)%\nPercentage of total revenue\n(1\n)%\n(1\n)%\n(2\n)%\nInvestment gains (losses), net\n1.0\n1.1\n(4.0\n)\n*\n*\nPercentage of total revenue\n**\n**\n**\nTotal non-operating income (expense), net\n$\n(29.3\n)\n$\n(51.3\n)\n$\n(66.6\n)\n(43\n)%\n(23\n)%\n_________________________________________\n(*) Percentage is not meaningful.\n(**) Percentage is less than 1%.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\nInterest and other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income (expense), net also includes gains and losses on fixed income investments and foreign exchange gains and losses other than any gains recorded to revenue from our hedging programs.\nInterest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the gain on the sale of certain property assets and, to a lesser extent, an increased average investment balance and average interest rate. See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the sale of our property assets.\nInterest and other income (expense), net increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to decreased foreign currency losses and increased realized gains on fixed income investments. The increases were partially offset by decreased interest income on our investment in lease receivable due to the purchase of the East and West Towers of our corporate headquarter offices during fiscal 2014. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily represents interest associated with our senior notes and interest rate swaps. Interest on our senior notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1. Floating interest payments on the interest rate swaps are paid monthly. The fixed-rate interest receivable on the swaps is received semi-annually concurrent with the senior notes interest payments.\nInterest expense increased during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to the increase in total debt, partially offset by the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps.\nInterest expense decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the favorable impact of the interest rate swaps. See Notes 5 and 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding our interest rate swaps.\nInvestment Gains (Losses), Net\nInvestment gains (losses), net consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities) and gains and losses associated with our direct and indirect investments in privately held companies.\nDuring fiscal 2015, total investment gains (losses), net remained stable compared to fiscal 2014.\nDuring fiscal 2014, total investment gains (losses), net increased to net gains primarily due to write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in value of our direct investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2013 that did not recur in fiscal 2014, offset in part by a decrease in net gains related to our trading securities.\nProvision for Income Taxes (dollars in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nProvision\n$\n244.2\n$\n93.0\n$\n66.2\n%\n%\nPercentage of total revenue\n%\n%\n%\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\n%\nOur effective tax rate increased by approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobes trading companies. The increase was partially offset by tax benefits related to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2014. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2014.\nOur effective tax rate increased by approximately seven percentage points during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2013 and stronger domestic profits for fiscal 2014.\nIn December 2015, the United States Congress passed the permanent extension of the federal research and development tax credit. As a result, we expect that our income tax provision for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 will include a discrete tax benefit for the 2015 credit which will reduce our effective tax rate for the quarter and, to a lesser extent, the effective annual tax rate.\nWe are a United States-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. A significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our Irish subsidiaries. In addition to providing for U.S. income taxes on earnings from the United States, we provide for U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. While we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings, if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. Currently, there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided. See Note 9 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. If the total unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 were recognized in the future, $220.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate, which is net of an estimated $38.5 million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future federal and state tax returns.\nAs of November 27, 2015, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately $27.8 million. This amount is included in non-current income taxes payable.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThis data should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs of\n(in millions)\nNovember 27, 2015\nNovember 28, 2014\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n876.6\n$\n1,117.4\nShort-term investments\n$\n3,111.5\n$\n2,622.1\nWorking capital\n$\n2,608.3\n$\n2,107.9\nStockholders equity\n$\n7,001.6\n$\n6,775.9\nA summary of our cash flows is as follows:\n(in millions)\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,469.5\n$\n1,287.5\n$\n1,151.7\nNet cash used for investing activities\n(1,488.4\n)\n(490.7\n)\n(1,177.8\n)\nNet cash used for financing activities\n(200.7\n)\n(507.3\n)\n(559.1\n)\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(21.2\n)\n(6.7\n)\n(5.2\n)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(240.8\n)\n$\n282.8\n$\n(590.4\n)\nOur primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses, general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent, and cost of revenue. Other sources of cash are proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan. Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase program, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscriptions for our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily due to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.\nFor fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee transition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.\nFor fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.15 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which were discontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission accruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue levels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.\nThe primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2013 were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses and other assets. The decrease in taxes payable was largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement adjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased primarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of federal research and development and foreign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor fiscal 2015, net cash used for investing activities of $1.49 billion was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and our acquisition of Fotolia. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2015 represented purchases of property and equipment, and long-term investments and other assets. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and proceeds received from the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 and Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisition of Fotolia and sale of property assets, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2014, net cash used for investing activities of $490.7 million was primarily due to purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment and a business acquisition. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments.\nFor fiscal 2013, net cash used for investing activities of $1.18 billion was primarily due to our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2013 represented purchases of short-term investments, purchases of property and equipment associated with our construction projects in Oregon and India and purchases of long-term technology licenses. These cash outflows were offset in part by sales and maturities of short-term investments and the sale of certain property assets. See Note 2 of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information regarding our acquisitions of Neolane and Behance.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million in connection with our 2025 Notes. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method.\nWe used $600 million of the proceeds from the 2025 Notes offering to repay the outstanding balance plus accrued and unpaid interest of the $600 million 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (2015 Notes). The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information.\nIn addition to the 2025 Notes issuance and 2015 Notes repayment, other financing activities during fiscal 2015 include payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\nFor fiscal 2014 and 2013, net cash used for financing activities of $507.3 million and $559.1 million, respectively, was primarily due to payments for our treasury stock repurchases and costs associated with the issuance of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of treasury stock and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. See the section titled Stock Repurchase Program discussed below.\nWe expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.\nRestructuring\nDuring the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. We consider our restructuring plans to be substantially complete.\nAs of November 27, 2015, we have accrued total restructuring charges of $4.7 million, substantially all of which relate to the cost of closing redundant facilities and is expected to be paid under contract through fiscal 2021 for which approximately 75% will be paid through fiscal 2017. During fiscal 2015, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $18.2 million which consisted of $16.6 million in payments associated with termination benefits and contract terminations and the remaining payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.\nAs of November 28, 2014, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $22.3 million of which approximately $15.0 million related to termination benefits and contract terminations. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $7.3 million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities. During fiscal 2014, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $11.0\nmillion which consisted of $5.7 million and $5.3 million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities, respectively.\nAs of November 29, 2013, we had accrued total restructuring charges of $13.9 million of which approximately $11.7 million\nrelated to the cost of closing redundant facilities. The remaining accrued restructuring charges of $2.2 million related to the cost of termination benefits and contract terminations. During fiscal 2013, we made payments related to our restructuring plans totaling $10.3 million which primarily consisted of $9.0 million in payments related to the closing of redundant facilities.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above.\nSee Note 10 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our restructuring plans.\nOther Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations\nOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2016 due to changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions. Our cash and investments totaled $3.99 billion as of November 27, 2015. Of this amount, approximately 85% was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects. Our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations, and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States and if U.S. tax has not already been previously provided, we would provide for and pay additional U.S. taxes in connection with repatriating these funds.\nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nOn March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. On March 1, 2013, we exercised our option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018. On July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement. As of November 27, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and the entire $1 billion credit line remains available for borrowing.\nAs of November 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion, consisting of $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes) and $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (together with the 2020 Notes, the Notes).\nOur short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper, U.S. agency securities and U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government securities, municipal securities and asset-backed securities.We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 57% of our consolidated invested balances during fiscal 2015.\nStock Repurchase Program\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we may repurchase shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third parties. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625 million, $600 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. Of the $625 million in prepayments made during fiscal 2015, $425 million were under the new $2 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $200 million were under the previous $2 billion authority. The $600 million and $1.1 billion in prepayments made during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were under the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions\nor fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nThe financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price per share of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.\nFor fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2015, November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2015, $38.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement. See Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our stock repurchase programs.\nSubsequent to November 27, 2015, as part of our $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $150 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion remains under our current authority.\nSee Item 5, Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 27, 2015.\nSummary of Stock Repurchases for Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013\n(in thousands, except average amounts)\nBoard Approval\nDate\nRepurchases\nUnder the Plan\nShares\nAverage\nShares\nAverage\nShares\nAverage\nApril 2012\nStructured repurchases(1)\n3,255\n$\n73.83\n10,852\n$\n63.48\n21,603\n$\n46.47\nJanuary 2015\nStructured repurchases(1)\n4,849\n$\n79.76\n-\n$\n-\n-\n$\n-\nTotal shares\n8,104\n$\n77.38\n10,852\n$\n63.48\n21,603\n$\n46.47\nTotal cost\n$627,082\n$688,902\n$1,003,794\n_________________________________________\n(1)\nStock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions.

See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 27, 2015 (in millions):\nPayment Due by Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 year\n1-3 years\n3-5 years\nMore than\n5 years\nNotes\n$\n2,401.1\n$\n75.3\n$\n150.5\n$\n1,029.1\n$\n1,146.2\nOperating lease obligations\n185.2\n39.5\n57.1\n43.2\n45.4\nPurchase obligations\n419.8\n341.3\n74.6\n3.9\n-\nTotal\n$\n3,006.1\n$\n456.1\n$\n282.2\n$\n1,076.2\n$\n1,191.6\nSenior Notes\nIn January 2015, we issued the 2025 Notes and settled the 2015 Notes. As of November 27, 2015, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes with a total carrying value of $1.91 billion. At November 27, 2015, our\nmaximum commitment for interest payments under the Notes was $501.1 million for the remaining duration of our Notes. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020.\nCovenants\nOur credit facility and Almaden Tower lease contain a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Our Notes do not contain any financial covenants.\nUnder the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nThe gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2015 was $258.7 million, exclusive of interest and penalties.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.\nRoyalties\nWe have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the directors or officers lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in millions, except Yen):\nFiscal\nFiscal\nFiscal\nEuro\n\u20ac\n589.6\n\u20ac\n455.5\n\u20ac\n434.7\nYen (in billions)\n\u00a5\n29.7\n\u00a5\n\u00a5\n32.5\nBritish Pounds\n\u00a3\n192.0\n\u00a3\n159.1\n\u00a3\n145.3\nAs of November 27, 2015, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $661.0 million which included the notional equivalent of $318.5 million in Euros, $144.4 million in British Pounds, $118.7 million in Yen and $79.4 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 27, 2015, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2016. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses which would be largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 27, 2015. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $39.0 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $18.4 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses.\nWe also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $61.9 million and $161.7 million, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedging-Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nWe record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. For the fiscal year ended November 27, 2015, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\nBalance Sheet Hedging-Hedging of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nWe hedge exposures related to our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income, net. These foreign exchange contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because\ngains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. At November 27, 2015, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.\nSee Note 5 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our hedging activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nShort-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities\nAt November 27, 2015, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $3.1 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. The following table separates these investments, based on stated maturities, to show the approximate exposure to interest rates (in millions):\nDue within one year\n$\n853.0\nDue within two years\n1,202.6\nDue within three years\n771.3\nDue after three years\n284.6\nTotal\n$\n3,111.5\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 27, 2015. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.\nThe following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (BPS), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 (dollars in millions):\n-150 BPS\n-100 BPS\n-50 BPS\nFair Value 11/27/15\n+50 BPS\n+100 BPS\n+150 BPS\n$\n3,172.3\n$\n3,156.6\n$\n3,135.2\n$\n3,111.5\n$\n3,087.7\n$\n3,063.9\n$\n3,040.1\n-150 BPS\n-100 BPS\n-50 BPS\nFair Value 11/28/14\n+50 BPS\n+100 BPS\n+150 BPS\n$\n2,663.3\n$\n2,656.3\n$\n2,641.9\n$\n2,621.6\n$\n2,599.8\n$\n2,578.0\n$\n2,556.2\nSenior Notes\nAs of November 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nAs of November 27, 2015, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.91 billion and the related fair value based on inactive market prices was $1.97 billion.\nOther Market Risk\nPrivately Held Long-Term Investments\nThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014. ITEM 8.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOperations\nFounded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We market and license our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as a hosted or cloud-based model) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), systems integrators, independent software vendors (ISVs), retailers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, excess inventory and purchase commitments, restructuring charges, facilities lease losses, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation, income taxes and investments. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 52-week years.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, time-based and perpetual software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services, consulting services, training and technical support.\nWe recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.\nMultiple Element Arrangements\nWe enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software, upgrades, maintenance and support, hosted services, and consulting.\nFor our software and software-related multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nproducts and services; (3) determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE); and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements. VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, consulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (BESP), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software or software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nSubscription and Services and Support Revenue\nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions, ratably beginning on the date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nOur services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, mobile and device products and solutions. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products.\nOur consulting revenue is recognized using a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as hours incurred to date, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones when applicable.\nOur maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the performance period of the arrangement.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur software subscription offerings, which may include product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis, hosted services, and online storage are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize revenue associated with these arrangements ratably over the subscription period.\nProduct Revenue\nWe recognize our product revenue upon shipment, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our desktop application product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. Our direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.\nWe recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided collection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing of securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting by our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately received from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.\nOur product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license agreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item as the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade to an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the right to the specified free upgrade expires.\nRights of Return, Rebates and Price Protection\nAs discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies and programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as an offset to revenue and accounts receivable. Below is a summary of each of the general provisions in our contracts:\nDistributors are allowed limited rights of return of products purchased during the previous quarter. In addition, distributors are allowed to return products that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and products that are being replaced by new versions.\nWe offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end user customers. The amount of revenue that is reduced for distributor and reseller rebates is based on actual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period (volume, timely reporting, etc.). If mail-in or other promotional rebates are offered, the amount of revenue reduced is based on the dollar amount of the rebate, taking into consideration an estimated redemption rate calculated using historical trends.\nFrom time to time, we may offer price protection to our distributors that allow for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. The amount of revenue that is reduced for price protection is calculated as the difference between the old and new price of a software product on inventory held by the distributor immediately prior to the effective date of the decrease.\nAlthough our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a customer cancels its contract, they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.\nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of revenue to determine a historical returns rate. We then apply the historical rate to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific returns reserve for product in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans and other factors.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRevenue Reserve\nRevenue reserve rollforward (in thousands):\nBeginning balance\n$\n17,402\n$\n28,664\n$\n57,058\nAmount charged to revenue\n45,676\n45,550\n74,031\nActual returns\n(43,632\n)\n(56,812\n)\n(102,425\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n19,446\n$\n17,402\n$\n28,664\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists substantially of payments received in advance of revenue recognition for our products and services described above. We recognize deferred revenue as revenue only when the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of potentially uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance is based on both specific and general reserves. We regularly review our trade receivables allowances by considering such factors as historical experience, credit-worthiness, the age of the trade receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay and we specifically reserve for those deemed uncollectible.\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n7,867\n$\n10,228\n$\n12,643\nIncrease due to acquisition\n1,038\nCharged to operating expenses\n1,472\nDeductions(1)\n(2,372\n)\n(3,015\n)\n(4,386\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n7,293\n$\n7,867\n$\n10,228\n________________________________________\n(1)\nDeductions related to the allowance for doubtful accounts represent amounts written off against the allowance, less recoveries.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 5 years for computers and equipment as well as server hardware under capital leases, 1 to 6 years for furniture and fixtures, and up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining respective lease term or estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 15 years.\nGoodwill, Purchased Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is assigned to one or more reporting segments on the date of acquisition. We evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segments to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine the fair values, we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors.\nWe review our goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently, if facts and circumstances warrant a review. We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We elected to use the Step 1 quantitative assessment for our reporting units and determined there was no impairment of goodwill.\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nexpected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nDuring fiscal 2015, our intangible assets were amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 14 years. Amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed or on a straight-line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent. The weighted average useful lives of our intangible assets were as follows:\nWeighted Average\nUseful Life (years)\nPurchased technology\nCustomer contracts and relationships\nTrademarks\nAcquired rights to use technology\nLocalization\nOther intangibles\nSoftware Development Costs\nCapitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use, generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. To date, software development costs incurred between completion of a working prototype and general availability of the related product have not been material.\nInternal Use Software\nWe capitalize costs associated with customized internal-use software systems that have reached the application development stage. Such capitalized costs include external direct costs utilized in developing or obtaining the applications and payroll and payroll-related expenses for employees who are directly associated with the development of the applications. Capitalization of such costs begins when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases at the point in which the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended purpose.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nTaxes Collected from Customers\nWe net taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities in our financial statements. Accordingly, taxes collected from customers are not reported as revenue.\nTreasury Stock\nWe account for treasury stock under the cost method. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price higher than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When treasury stock is re-issued at a price lower than its cost, the difference is recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital to the extent that there are previously recorded gains to offset the losses. If there are no treasury stock gains in additional paid-in-capital, the losses upon re-issuance of treasury stock are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $113.6 million, $87.9 million and $88.5 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe translate assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenue and expenses at the monthly average exchange rates. We include accumulated net translation adjustments in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nForeign Currency and Other Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We use foreign exchange option and forward contracts for revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Yen. We hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings. See Note 5 for information regarding our hedging activities.\nGains and losses from foreign exchange forward contracts which hedge certain balance sheet positions are recorded each period as a component of interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Foreign exchange option contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of tax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted transactions occur.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.\nOur investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. Our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these investments.\nWe enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions.\nThe aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 was $19.1 million and $33.0 million respectively. These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting date as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial liabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties.\nCredit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, customers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, dealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and require letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever deemed necessary. The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments from their customers. We also purchase credit insurance to mitigate credit risk in some foreign markets where we believe it is\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nwarranted. If we license our software or provide SaaS services to a customer where we have a reason to believe the customers ability to pay is not probable, due to country risk or credit risk, we will not recognize the revenue. We will revert to recognizing the revenue on a cash basis, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition has been met.\nWe derive a significant portion of our OEM PostScript and Other licensing revenue from a small number of OEMs. Our OEMs on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty arrangements. We evaluate these requests on a case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for us.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as noncurrent simplifies entities processes as it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We have not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWith the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS\nFotolia\nOn January 27, 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, images, graphics and HD videos. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we began integrating Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable segment.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Fotolia's net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of January 27, 2015. During fiscal 2015, we recorded immaterial purchase accounting adjustments based on changes to managements estimates and assumptions in regards to assumed intangible assets, calculation of deferred tax assets, liabilities and equity awards. The total final purchase price for Fotolia was $807.5 million of which $745.1 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $204.4 million to identifiable intangible assets and $142.0 million to net liabilities assumed.\nNeolane\nOn July 22, 2013, we completed our acquisition of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we began integrating Neolane into our Digital Marketing reportable segment. Neolane brings a platform for automation and execution of marketing campaigns across the web, e-mail, social, mobile, call center, direct mail, point of sale and other emerging channels which will drive consistent brand experiences and personalized campaigns for our customers.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total final purchase price was allocated to Neolanes net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of July 22, 2013. The total final purchase price for Neolane was $616.7 million of which $515.2 million was allocated to goodwill that was non-deductible for tax purposes, $115.0 million to identifiable intangible assets and $13.5 million to net liabilities assumed.\nBehance\nOn December 20, 2012, we completed our acquisition of privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover creative work. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we began integrating Behance into our Digital Media reportable segment. Behances community and portfolio capabilities have accelerated our strategy to bring additional community features to Creative Cloud.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price was allocated to Behances net tangible and intangible assets based upon their estimated fair values as of December 20, 2012. The total final purchase price for Behance was approximately $111.1 million of which $91.4 million was allocated to goodwill, $28.5 million to identifiable intangible assets and $8.8 million to net liabilities assumed.\nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not been presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was not material.\nNOTE 3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\nCash equivalents consist of instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We classify all of our cash equivalents and short-term investments as available-for-sale. In general, these investments are free of trading restrictions. We carry these investments at fair value, based on quoted market prices or other readily available market information. Unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses are recognized when realized in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When we have determined that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value has occurred, the amount of the decline that is related to a credit loss is recognized in income. Gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following as of November 27, 2015 (in thousands):\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$\n352,371\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n352,371\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds\n482,479\n-\n-\n482,479\nMunicipal securities\n1,850\n-\n(1\n)\n1,849\nTime deposits\n13,461\n-\n-\n13,461\nU.S. Treasury securities\n26,400\n-\n-\n26,400\nTotal cash equivalents\n524,190\n-\n(1\n)\n524,189\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n876,561\n-\n(1\n)\n876,560\nShort-term fixed income securities:\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n1,890,253\n2,273\n(5,612\n)\n1,886,914\nAsset-backed securities\n83,449\n(146\n)\n83,314\nForeign government securities\n1,276\n-\n(8\n)\n1,268\nMunicipal securities\n137,280\n(49\n)\n137,332\nU.S. agency securities\n130,397\n(14\n)\n130,468\nU.S. Treasury securities\n873,400\n(1,273\n)\n872,228\nTotal short-term investments\n3,116,055\n2,571\n(7,102\n)\n3,111,524\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n3,992,616\n$\n2,571\n$\n(7,103\n)\n$\n3,988,084\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments consisted of the following as of November 28, 2014 (in thousands):\nAmortized\nCost\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$\n348,283\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n348,283\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds\n705,978\n-\n-\n705,978\nTime deposits\n63,139\n-\n-\n63,139\nTotal cash equivalents\n769,117\n-\n-\n769,117\nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n1,117,400\n-\n-\n1,117,400\nShort-term fixed income securities:\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n1,514,632\n5,253\n(509\n)\n1,519,376\nForeign government securities\n4,499\n-\n4,511\nMunicipal securities\n174,775\n(12\n)\n175,201\nU.S. agency securities\n497,154\n1,295\n(64\n)\n498,385\nU.S. Treasury securities\n423,075\n1,080\n(28\n)\n424,127\nSubtotal\n2,614,135\n8,078\n(613\n)\n2,621,600\nMarketable equity securities\n-\nTotal short-term investments\n2,614,288\n8,416\n(613\n)\n2,622,091\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n$\n3,731,688\n$\n8,416\n$\n(613\n)\n$\n3,739,491\nSee Note 4 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses related to available-for-sale securities, aggregated by investment category, that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months, as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 (in thousands):\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n$\n1,112,883\n$\n(5,377\n)\n$\n291,890\n$\n(443\n)\nAsset-backed securities\n60,057\n(147\n)\n-\n-\nMunicipal securities\n35,594\n(50\n)\n21,759\n(12\n)\nForeign government securities\n1,268\n(8\n)\n-\n-\nU.S. Treasury and agency securities\n820,570\n(1,287\n)\n43,507\n(64\n)\nTotal\n$\n2,030,372\n$\n(6,869\n)\n$\n357,156\n$\n(519\n)\nThere were 914 securities and 213 securities in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months at November 27, 2015 and at November 28, 2014, respectively.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized losses related to available-for-sale securities, aggregated by investment category, that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for more than twelve months, as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 (in thousands):\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n$\n30,218\n$\n(233\n)\n$\n8,636\n$\n(66\n)\nMunicipal securities\n1,300\n(1\n)\n-\n-\nU.S. Treasury and agency securities\n-\n-\n5,884\n(28\n)\nTotal\n$\n31,518\n$\n(234\n)\n$\n14,520\n$\n(94\n)\nThere were fifteen securities and eight securities in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months at November 27, 2015 and at November 28, 2014, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the cost and estimated fair value of short-term fixed income securities classified as short-term investments based on stated effective maturities as of November 27, 2015 (in thousands):\nAmortized\nCost\nEstimated\nFair Value\nDue within one year\n$\n853,041\n$\n853,007\nDue between one and two years\n1,205,254\n1,202,586\nDue between two and three years\n773,150\n771,332\nDue after three years\n284,610\n284,599\nTotal\n$\n3,116,055\n$\n3,111,524\nWe review our debt and marketable equity securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not any security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For equity securities, the write-down would be recorded to investment gains (losses), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not consider any of our investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAssets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nWe measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. There have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the year ended November 27, 2015.\nThe fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at November 27, 2015 was determined using the following inputs (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds\n$\n482,479\n$\n482,479\n$\n-\n$\n-\nMunicipal securities\n1,849\n-\n1,849\n-\nTime deposits\n13,461\n13,461\n-\n-\nU.S. Treasury securities\n26,400\n-\n26,400\n-\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n1,886,914\n-\n1,886,914\n-\nAsset-backed securities\n83,314\n-\n83,314\n-\nForeign government securities\n1,268\n-\n1,268\n-\nMunicipal securities\n137,332\n-\n137,332\n-\nU.S. agency securities\n130,468\n-\n130,468\n-\nU.S. Treasury securities\n872,228\n-\n872,228\n-\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivatives\n19,126\n-\n19,126\n-\nOther assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets\n32,063\n31,092\n-\nInterest rate swap derivatives\n19,821\n-\n19,821\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n3,706,723\n$\n496,911\n$\n3,209,812\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses:\nForeign currency derivatives\n$\n2,154\n$\n-\n$\n2,154\n$\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n2,154\n$\n-\n$\n2,154\n$\n-\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at November 28, 2014 was determined using the following inputs (in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets\nSignificant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs\nSignificant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nCash equivalents:\nMoney market mutual funds\n$\n705,978\n$\n705,978\n$\n-\n$\n-\nTime deposits\n63,139\n63,139\n-\n-\nShort-term investments:\nCorporate bonds and commercial paper\n1,519,376\n-\n1,519,376\n-\nForeign government securities\n4,511\n-\n4,511\n-\nMarketable equity securities\n-\n-\nMunicipal securities\n175,201\n-\n175,201\n-\nU.S. agency securities\n498,385\n-\n498,385\n-\nU.S. Treasury securities\n424,127\n-\n424,127\n-\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets:\nForeign currency derivatives\n32,991\n-\n32,991\n-\nOther assets:\nDeferred compensation plan assets\n25,745\n25,196\n-\nInterest rate swap derivatives\n14,268\n-\n14,268\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n3,464,212\n$\n770,157\n$\n2,694,055\n$\n-\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses:\nForeign currency derivatives\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nTotal liabilities\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\nSee Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.\nOur fixed income available-for-sale securities consist of high quality, investment grade securities from diverse issuers with a minimum credit rating of BBB and a weighted average credit rating of AA-. We value these securities based on pricing from pricing vendors who may use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs) or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2 inputs) in determining fair value. However, we classify all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as having Level 2 inputs. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments and derivatives having Level 2 inputs were derived from non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models such as discounted cash flow techniques. Our procedures include controls to ensure that appropriate fair values are recorded such as comparing prices obtained from multiple independent sources.\nOur deferred compensation plan assets consist of prime money market funds and mutual funds.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe also have direct investments in privately held companies accounted for under the cost method, which are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment. If we determine that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, we write\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ndown the investment to its fair value. We estimate fair value of our cost method investments considering available information such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, we determined there were no other-than-temporary impairments on our cost method investments.\nAs of November 27, 2015, the carrying value of our lease receivables approximated fair value, based on Level 2 valuation inputs which include Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) interest rates and applicable credit spreads. See Note 15 for further details regarding our investment in lease receivables.\nThe fair value of our senior notes was $1.97 billion as of November 27, 2015, based on observable market prices in less active market and categorized as Level 2. See Note 16 for further details regarding our debt.\nNOTE 5. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nHedge Accounting and Hedging Programs\nWe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The net gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was insignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, we enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement of transactions. Our hedging policy also establishes maximum limits for each counterparty to mitigate any concentration of risk.\nFair Value Hedging-Hedges of Interest Rate Risks\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our $900 million of 4.75% fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). In effect, the interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount through February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 16 for further details regarding our debt.\nThe interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedging-Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Interest Rate Risks\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. We record changes in\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nthe intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income at that time. If we do not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from period to period are recorded in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a notional amount of $600 million to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. Upon issuance of our $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes) in January 2015, we terminated the instrument and incurred a loss of $16.2 million. This loss was recorded in the stockholders equity section in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to interest expense over a ten-year term consistent with the impact of the hedged item. See Note 16 for further details regarding our debt.\nFor fiscal 2015, there were no net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur. In fiscal 2014 and 2013 these net gains or losses were insignificant.\nBalance Sheet Hedging-Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nWe also hedge our net recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that the value of these assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These contracts hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged.\nAs of November 27, 2015, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $228.3 million which included the notional equivalent of $75.8 million in Euros, $44.3 million in British Pounds, $37.8 million in Australian Dollars, $28.8 million in Japanese Yen, and $41.6 million in other foreign currencies.

The total carrying value of the property assets was $36.3 million which mostly pertained to the land. The decision to sell these property assets was largely based upon a general lack of operational needs for the building and land, and recent improvements in market conditions for commercial real estate in the area. We began to actively market the assets during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and finalized the sale of these assets on September 23, 2015 for total proceeds of $57.8 million. The gain on the sale of the property assets was included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn August 2014, we exercised our option to purchase the East and West Towers of our corporate headquarter offices for a total purchase price of $143.2 million. We capitalized the East and West Towers as property and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at $144.1 million, the lesser of cost or fair value, which represented the total purchase price plus other direct costs associated with the purchase. These buildings are depreciated over their useful life of 40 years on a straight-line basis.\nNOTE 7.

Of these amounts, $104.4 million and $100.2 million were included in cost of sales for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2013, we acquired rights to use certain technology for $51.8 million, of which $26.5 million was related to historical use of licensing rights and was expensed as cost of product revenue.

The total change in deferred tax assets and liabilities includes changes that are recorded to other comprehensive income, additional paid-in capital, goodwill, unrecognized tax benefits and retained earnings.\nWe provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the United States. To the extent that the foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings. As of November 27, 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $3.7 billion. The unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings is approximately $1.0 billion.\nAs of November 27, 2015, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $52.1 million for federal, $16.4 million for state, and $7.6 million for foreign. We also have state and foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately $55.0 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credits will expire in various years from fiscal 2016 through 2034. The state tax credit carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely. The net operating loss carryforward assets and certain credits are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382, but are expected to be fully realized.\nIn addition, we have been tracking certain deferred tax attributes of approximately $55.0 million which have not been recorded in the financial statements pursuant to accounting standards related to stock-based compensation. These amounts are no longer included in our gross or net deferred tax assets. Pursuant to these standards, the benefit of these deferred tax assets will be recorded to equity if and when they reduce taxes payable.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs of November 27, 2015, a valuation allowance of $21.3 million has been established for certain deferred tax assets related to the impairment of investments and certain state and foreign assets. For fiscal 2015, the total change in the valuation allowance was immaterial.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nDuring fiscal 2015 and 2014, our aggregate changes in our total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are summarized as follows (in thousands):\nBeginning balance\n$\n148,848\n$\n136,098\nGross increases in unrecognized tax benefits - prior year tax positions\n3,784\nGross increases in unrecognized tax benefits - current year tax positions\n129,358\n18,877\nSettlements with taxing authorities\n(11,548\n)\n(995\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(2,687\n)\n(1,630\n)\nForeign exchange gains and losses\n(9,037\n)\n(3,646\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n258,718\n$\n148,848\nAs of November 27, 2015, the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns and included in non-current income taxes payable was approximately $27.8 million.\nWe file income tax returns in the United States on a federal basis and in many U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest fiscal years open for examination are 2008, 2010 and 2010, respectively. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from $0 to approximately $10 million.\nNOTE 10. RESTRUCTURING\nFiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, in order to better align our global resources for Digital Media and Digital Marketing, we initiated a restructuring plan to vacate our Research and Development facility in China and our Sales and Marketing facility in Russia. This plan consisted of reductions of approximately 350 full-time positions and we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $21.0 million through fiscal 2015 related to ongoing termination benefits for the positions eliminated. The amount accrued for the fair value of future contractual obligations under these operating leases was insignificant. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we vacated both of these facilities and as of November 27, 2015 we consider the Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan to be substantially complete.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nDuring the past several years, we have implemented Other Restructuring Plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015, we considered our Other Restructuring Plans to be substantially complete. We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSummary of Restructuring Plans\nThe following table sets forth a summary of restructuring activities related to all of our restructuring plans described above during fiscal 2015 (in thousands):\nNovember 28,\nCosts\nIncurred\nCash\nPayments\nOther\nAdjustments\nNovember 27,\nFiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan:\nTermination benefits\n$\n14,461\n$\n$\n(16,512\n)\n$\n1,290\n$\nCost of closing redundant facilities\n-\n(417\n)\n(55\n)\n-\nOther Restructuring Plans:\nTermination benefits\n-\n(120\n)\n(230\n)\nCost of closing redundant facilities\n6,844\n(1,130\n)\n(1,819\n)\n4,535\nTotal restructuring plans\n$\n22,314\n$\n1,413\n$\n(18,179\n)\n$\n(814\n)\n$\n4,734\nAccrued restructuring charges of $4.7 million as of November 27, 2015 include $1.5 million recorded in accrued restructuring, current and $3.2 million related to long-term facilities obligations recorded in accrued restructuring, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect to pay accrued termination benefits through fiscal 2016 and facilities-related liabilities under contract through fiscal 2021 of which approximately 75% will be paid through 2017.\nNOTE 11. BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\nIn 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is a retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2015, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employees eligible compensation. We contributed $25.7 million, $24.8 million and $22.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Adobe is under no obligation to continue matching future employee contributions and at the Companys discretion may change its practices at any time.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nOn September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, effective December 2, 2006 (the Deferred Compensation Plan). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified, deferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a portion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified compensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors fees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan year in which the election is made in the form of a lump sum or annual installments over five, ten or fifteen years. Upon termination of a participants employment with Adobe, such participant will receive a distribution in the form of a lump sum payment. All distributions will be made in cash, except for deferred performance-based and time-based restricted stock units which will be settled in stock. As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan total $32.1 million and $25.7 million, respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, $39.6 million and $31.0 million, respectively, was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur stock-based compensation programs are long-term retention programs that are intended to attract, retain and provide incentives for employees, officers and directors, and to align stockholder and employee interests. We have the following stock-based compensation plans and programs:\nRestricted Stock Unit Plans\nWe currently grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (2003 Plan). In February 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors retired our remaining share reserves under the 2005 Equity Incentive Assumption Plan (2005 Assumption Plan). Restricted stock units granted under these plans as part of our annual review process vest annually over three years. Other restricted stock units granted under these plans generally vest over four years, the majority of which vest 25% annually. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board of Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan. Performance awards granted under this plan between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 vest annually over three years, and performance awards granted in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 cliff-vest after three years.\nAs of November 27, 2015, we had reserved 173.2 million shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and had 48.5 million shares available for grant.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount through payroll deductions. The ESPP consists of a twenty-four month offering period with four six-month purchase periods in each offering period. Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our common stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The ESPP will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued.\nAs of November 27, 2015, we had reserved 93.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and approximately 10.8 million shares remain available for future issuance.\nStock Option Plans\nThe Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees in fiscal 2012. Stock option grants to non-employee directors were minimal in fiscal 2013, and in December 2013 the Board of Directors eliminated the use of option grants for directors as well.\nThe 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-employee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed. Option vesting periods are generally four years and expire seven years from the effective date of grant.\nPerformance Share Programs\nOn January 26, 2015, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2015 Performance Share Program, including the award calculation methodology, under the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Under our 2015 Performance Share Program (2015 Program), shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. The purpose of the 2015 Program is to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding Company performance and enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later of the three-year anniversary of the grant date on January 24, 2018 or the Executive Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement. Participants in the 2015 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOn January 24, 2014, our Executive Compensation Committee approved the 2014 Performance Share Program, including the award calculation methodology, under the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Under our 2014 Performance Share Program (2014 Program), shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. The purpose of the 2014 Program is to help focus key employees on building stockholder value, provide significant award potential for achieving outstanding company performance and enhance the ability of Adobe to attract and retain highly talented and competent individuals. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later of the three-year anniversary of the grant date on January 24, 2017 or the Executive Compensation Committees certification of the level of achievement. Participants in the 2014 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted.\nEffective January 24, 2013, our Executive Compensation Committee modified our Performance Share Program by eliminating the use of qualitative performance objectives, with 100% of shares to be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over a three-year performance period. Performance awards were granted under the 2013 Performance Share Program (2013 Program) pursuant to the terms of our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. The purpose of the 2013 Program is to align key management and senior leadership with stockholders interests over the long term and to retain key employees. Performance share awards will be awarded and fully vest at the later of the three-year anniversary of the grant date on January 24, 2016 or the Executive Compensation Committee's certification of the level of achievement. Participants in the 2013 Program generally have the ability to receive up to 200% of the target number of shares originally granted.\nIssuance of Shares\nUpon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock and performance shares, and purchases of shares under the ESPP, we will issue treasury stock. If treasury stock is not available, common stock will be issued. In order to minimize the impact of on-going dilution from exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock and performance shares, we instituted a stock repurchase program. See Note 13 for information regarding our stock repurchase programs.\nValuation of Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP shares and stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected dividends.\nWe estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on zero-coupon yields implied by U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model.\nWe eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees effective fiscal 2012, and for all of the non-employee directors effective fiscal 2014.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe expected term of ESPP shares is the average of the remaining purchase periods under each offering period.

The initial equity grant to a new non-employee director is a restricted stock unit award having an aggregate value of $0.3 million based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100% on the day preceding the next annual meeting. The actual target grant value will be prorated based on the number of days remaining before the next annual meeting or the date of the first anniversary of our last annual meeting if the next annual meeting is not yet scheduled.\nAnnual equity grants to non-employee directors shall have an aggregate value of $0.3 million as based on the average stock price over the 30 calendar days ending on the day before the date of grant and vest 100% on the day preceding the next annual meeting. Starting in fiscal 2014, we eliminated the use of non-qualified stock options for our non-employee directors and restricted stock units became the primary form of their annual equity grants.\nRestricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):\nRestricted stock units granted to existing directors\nRestricted stock units granted to new directors\n-\n-\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAs part of the annual equity awards process in 2013, there were approximately 25 thousand options granted to non-employee directors with a $45.03 exercise price, equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These options vested 100% on the day preceding the fiscal 2014 annual meeting and had a seven-year term.\nCompensation Costs\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures. The fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 awards are earned upon achievement of an objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year performance period, as described above, and are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards was fixed at grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. For the fiscal 2012 performance shares, expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche of the award.\nAs of November 27, 2015, there was $394.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting the Company authority to repurchase up to $2 billion in common stock through the end of fiscal 2017.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling $625.0 million, $600.0 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively. Of the $625.0 million prepayments during fiscal 2015, $425.0 million was under the new $2 billion stock repurchase program and the remaining $200.0 million was under the previous $2 billion authority. The $600.0 million and $1.1 billion prepayments during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were under the previous $2 billion stock repurchase authority. We enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than our estimate of the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us.\nThe financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an average price of $77.38 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares at an average price of $63.48 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2013, we repurchased approximately 21.6 million shares at an average price per share of $46.47 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012.\nFor fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2015, November 28, 2014 and November 29, 2013 were excluded from the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2015, $38.2 million of prepayments remained under the agreement.\nSubsequent to November 27, 2015, as part of our $2 billion stock repurchase program, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $150 million. This amount will be classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon completion of the $150 million stock repurchase agreement, $1.43 billion remains under our current authority.\nNOTE 14. NET INCOME PER SHARE\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested restricted stock. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock and stock options using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except per share data):\nNet income\n$\n629,551\n$\n268,395\n$\n289,985\nShares used to compute basic net income per share\n498,764\n497,867\n501,372\nDilutive potential common shares:\nUnvested restricted stock and performance share awards\n7,389\n8,586\n8,736\nStock options\n1,011\n2,027\n3,368\nShares used to compute diluted net income per share\n507,164\n508,480\n513,476\nBasic net income per share\n$\n1.26\n$\n0.54\n$\n0.58\nDiluted net income per share\n$\n1.24\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.56\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFor fiscal 2015, there were no options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of our stock of $79.22 that would have been anti-dilutive.\nFor fiscal 2014 and 2013, options to purchase shares of common stock with exercise prices greater than the average fair market value of our stock of $65.93 and $45.08, respectively, were not included in the calculation because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. The number of shares of common stock under these options was immaterial.\nNOTE 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLease Commitments\nWe lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2028. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and variable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was approximately $92.9 million, $111.1 million, and $119.0 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented.\nWe occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. We own the land and the East and West Tower buildings, and lease the Almaden Tower building. See Note 6 for discussion of our East and West Towers purchase.\nThe lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of $80.4 million, which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 27, 2015, the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower approximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the building at any time during the lease term for $103.6 million. If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against the purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is $89.4 million.\nThe Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable. The Almaden Tower lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment and, as such, the building and the related obligation are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations and operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter as of November 27, 2015 (in thousands):\nOperating Leases\nFiscal Year\nPurchase\nObligations\nFuture\nMinimum\nLease\nPayments\nFuture\nMinimum\nSublease\nIncome\n$\n341,288\n$\n41,192\n$\n1,678\n62,915\n32,138\n1,579\n11,730\n27,795\n1,257\n3,795\n24,437\n1,309\n21,416\n1,345\nThereafter\n-\n46,569\n1,198\nTotal\n$\n419,787\n$\n193,547\n$\n8,366\nThe table above includes operating lease commitments related to our restructured facilities. See Note 10 for information regarding our restructuring charges.\nRoyalties\nWe have royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under our cost of revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income, was approximately $62.3 million, $45.2 million and $40.2 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time, we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officers or directors lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn connection with disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights, we have been, are currently and may in the future be subject to claims, negotiations or complex, protracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation may be very costly and can be disruptive to our business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Although we have successfully defended or resolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our sale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service agreements.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nBetween May 4, 2011 and July 14, 2011, five putative class action lawsuits were filed in Santa Clara Superior Court and Alameda Superior Court in California. On September 12, 2011, the cases were consolidated into In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation (HTEAL) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. In the consolidated complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Adobe, along with Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar, agreed not to recruit each others employees in violation of Federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintiffs claim the alleged agreements suppressed employee compensation and deprived employees of career opportunities. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, monetary damages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. All defendants deny the allegations and that they engaged in any wrongdoing of any kind. On October 24, 2013, the court certified a class of all persons who worked in the technical, creative, and/or research and development fields on a salaried basis in the United States for one or more of the following: (a) Apple from March 2005 through December 2009; (b) Adobe from May 2005 through December 2009; (c) Google from March 2005 through December 2009; (d) Intel from March 2005 through December 2009; (e) Intuit from June 2007 through December 2009; (f) Lucasfilm from January 2005 through December 2009; or (g) Pixar from January 2005 through December 2009, excluding retail employees, corporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of all defendants. During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation. In March 2015, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement and on September 2, 2015, the court granted final approval of the settlement. We expect to incur no additional losses associated with this matter.\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary course of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal proceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a quarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably possible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue for such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with our Audit Committee and our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise specifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim against us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be incurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is immaterial.\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\nIn connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter-claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 16. DEBT\nOur debt as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nNotes\n$\n1,887,410\n$\n1,496,778\nFair value of interest rate swap\n19,821\n14,268\nAdjusted carrying value of Notes\n1,907,231\n1,511,046\nCapital lease obligations\n-\n3,269\nTotal debt and capital lease obligations\n1,907,231\n1,514,315\nLess: current portion\n-\n603,229\nDebt and capital lease obligations\n$\n1,907,231\n$\n911,086\nNotes\nIn February 2010, we issued $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2015 (the 2015 Notes) and $900 million of 4.75% senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes). Our proceeds were $1.5 billion and were net of an issuance discount of $6.6 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $10.7 million. Both the discount and issuance costs were or are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2015 and 2020 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2015 and 2020 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount and issuance costs was 3.45% for the 2015 Notes and is 4.92% for the 2020 Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1, and commenced on August 1, 2010. The 2015 Notes were settled on February 1, 2015, as discussed below.\nIn June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $900 million designated as a fair value hedge related to our 2020 Notes. The interest rate swaps effectively convert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. Under the terms of the swaps, we will pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR floating interest rate plus a spread of a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate swap derivatives.\nIn December 2014, prior to issuing new long-term fixed rate debt, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement on a notional amount of $600 million to hedge against the variability of future interest payments due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. See Note 5 for further details regarding our interest rate lock agreement.\nIn January 2015, we issued $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due February 1, 2025 (the 2025 Notes). Our proceeds were approximately $989.3 million which is net of an issuance discount of $10.7 million. In addition, we incurred issuance costs of $7.9 million. Both the discount and issuance costs are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2025 Notes rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The effective interest rate including the discount, issuance costs and interest rate agreement is 3.67% for the 2025 Notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1, commencing on August 1, 2015. A portion of the proceeds from this offering was used to repay $600 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2015 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest due February 1, 2015. The remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nAs of November 27, 2015, our outstanding notes payable consists of the 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes (the Notes) with a total carrying value of $1.91 billion. Based on quoted prices in inactive markets, the fair value of the Notes was $1.97 billion as of November 27, 2015. The total fair value of $1.97 billion excludes the effect of fair value hedge of the 2020 Notes for which we entered into interest rate swaps as described above.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe may redeem the Notes at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to repurchase the Notes, at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. The Notes also include covenants that limit our ability to grant liens on assets and to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to significant allowances. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants.\nIn February 2015, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2015 and 2020 Notes totaling $31.1 million. In August 2015, we made semi-annual interest payments on our 2020 and 2025 Notes totaling $38.1 million.\nCredit Agreement\nOn March 2, 2012, we entered into a five-year $1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement), providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, we may, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, request up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.5 billion. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our public debt ratings, ranging from 0.795% and 1.3% or (ii) the base rate, which is defined as the highest of (a) the agents prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (c) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.00% to 0.30%. Commitment fees are payable quarterly at rates between 0.08% and 0.20% per year, also based on our debt ratings. Subject to certain conditions stated in the Credit Agreement, we and any of our subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and re-borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility at any time during the term of the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and acquisition transactions, dispositions and other matters, all subject to certain exceptions. The financial covenant, based on a quarterly financial test, requires us not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio.\nOn March 1, 2013, we exercised an option under the Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement by one year to March 2, 2018.\nOn July 27, 2015, we entered into an amendment to further extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to July 27, 2020 and reallocated the facility among the syndicate of lenders that are parties to the Credit Agreement.\nThe facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on the maturity date unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain events, including an event of default, or (b) the maturity date is further extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders.\nAs of November 27, 2015, there were no outstanding borrowings under this Credit Agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nNOTE 17.

The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments.\nOur CEO, the chief operating decision maker, reviews revenue and gross margin information for each of our reportable segments, but does not review operating expenses on a segment by segment basis. In addition, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets, we do not identify or allocate our assets by the reportable segments.\nWe have the following reportable segments:\nDigital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere. Our customers include traditional content creators, web application developers and digital media professionals, as well as their management in marketing departments and agencies, companies and publishers. Our customers also include knowledge workers who create, collaborate and distribute documents.\nDigital Marketing-Our Digital Marketing segment provides solutions and services for how digital advertising and marketing are created, managed, executed, measured and optimized. Our customers include digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, web analysts, chief marketing officers, chief information officer and chief revenue officers.\nPrint and Publishing-Our Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse authoring and publishing needs of technical and business publishing to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses.\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur segment results for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDigital Media\nDigital\nMarketing\nPrint and Publishing\nTotal\nFiscal 2015\nRevenue\n$\n3,095,160\n$\n1,508,858\n$\n191,493\n$\n4,795,511\nCost of revenue\n210,587\n525,309\n8,421\n744,317\nGross profit\n$\n2,884,573\n$\n983,549\n$\n183,072\n$\n4,051,194\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue\n%\n%\n%\n%\nFiscal 2014\nRevenue\n$\n2,603,179\n$\n1,355,216\n$\n188,670\n$\n4,147,065\nCost of revenue\n148,958\n463,772\n9,350\n622,080\nGross profit\n$\n2,454,221\n$\n891,444\n$\n179,320\n$\n3,524,985\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue\n%\n%\n%\n%\nFiscal 2013\nRevenue\n$\n2,625,913\n$\n1,228,868\n$\n200,459\n$\n4,055,240\nCost of revenue\n170,788\n404,804\n10,965\n586,557\nGross profit\n$\n2,455,125\n$\n824,064\n$\n189,494\n$\n3,468,683\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue\n%\n%\n%\n%\nThe tables below list our revenue and property and equipment, net, by geographic area for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands).

We also have audited Adobe Systems Incorporateds internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Adobe Systems Incorporateds management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 27, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, Adobe Systems Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n(signed) KPMG LLP\nSanta Clara, California\nJanuary 19, 2016 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 27, 2015. Based on their evaluation as of November 27, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and regulations and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Adobe have been detected.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 27, 2015. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Our management has concluded that, as of November 27, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended November 27, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
