The Company's history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the United States of America. Today, Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other consumer goods end markets. The Company's innovation excellence and global packaging expertise enable the Company to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional, appealing, and cost effective for its customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") for interim financial information. Consistent with these requirements, this Form 10-Q does not include all the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Further, the year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2023 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. It is management's opinion, however, that all material and recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary for a fair statement of the Company's interim financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For further information, this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nThere have been no material changes to the accounting policies followed by the Company during the current fiscal year. Certain amounts in the Company's notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not add or recalculate due to rounding.\nNote 2 - New Accounting Guidance\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2022-04 that adds certain disclosure requirements for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements in ASU 2022-04 on July 1, 2023, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective in fiscal year 2025.\nThe Company facilitates several regional voluntary supply chain financing (\"SCF\") programs with financial institutions, all of which have similar characteristics. The Company establishes these SCF programs to provide its suppliers with a potential source of liquidity and to enable a more efficient payment process. Under these SCF programs, qualifying suppliers may elect, but are not obligated, to sell their receivables due from Amcor to these financial institutions in advance of the agreed payment due date. The Company is not involved in negotiations between the suppliers and the financial institutions, and its rights and obligations to its suppliers are not impacted by its suppliers decisions to sell amounts to the financial institutions. Under these SCF programs, the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated invoice amounts from its participating suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices. The range of payment terms negotiated with suppliers under these arrangements are consistent with industry norms and short-term in nature, regardless of whether a supplier participates in the program. The Company's SCF programs do not include any guarantees to the financial institutions, or any assets pledged as securities.\nAll outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF programs are reflected in trade payables in the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, and associated payments are included in operating activities within the Companys unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the amounts due to suppliers participating in the Companys SCF programs amounted to $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nAccounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 that adds new reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The new standard's amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods beginning July 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning July 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and will be applied retrospectively to all periods in the financial statements. The Company will adopt this guidance in fiscal year 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 that adds new income tax disclosure requirements, primarily related to existing income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The new standard's amendments are effective for the Company for annual periods beginning July 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its disclosures.\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. The Company determined at this time that all other ASUs not yet adopted are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position, and disclosures.\nNote 3 - Restructuring and Other Related Activities, Net\nRestructuring and other related activities, net, as reported on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income are summarized as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nGain on disposal of Russian business, net $ - $ 215 $ - $ 215\nRestructuring and related expenses, net (24) (2) (52) (3)\nRestructuring and other related activities, net $ (24) $ 213 $ (52) $ 212\nA pre-tax net gain on disposal of the Company's three manufacturing facilities in Russia (\"Russian business\") of $215 million was recognized in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2022. For further information refer to Note 4, \"Acquisitions and Disposals\".\nRefer to Note 5, \"Restructuring\" for information on restructuring and related expenses, net.\nNote 4 - Acquisitions and Disposals\nFiscal Year 2024 - Acquisition\nOn September 27, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a small manufacturer of flexible packaging for food, home care, and personal care applications in India for a purchase consideration of $14 million plus the assumption of debt of $10 million. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and the Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition.\nFiscal Year 2023 - Acquisitions\nOn May 31, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a New Zealand based leading manufacturer of state-of-the-art, automated protein packaging machines. The purchase consideration of $45 million is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes contingent consideration of $13 million, to be earned and paid in cash over the two years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting certain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired identifiable net assets of $21 million and goodwill of $24 million. Goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent consideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of December 31, 2023 using information available as of the acquisition date, and are considered preliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition.\nOn March 17, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of a 100% equity interest in a medical device packaging manufacturing site in Shanghai, China. The purchase consideration of $61 million includes contingent consideration of $20 million, to be earned and paid in cash over the three years following the acquisition date, subject to meeting certain performance targets. The acquisition is part of the Company's Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired identifiable net assets of $21 million and goodwill of $40 million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the contingent consideration, identifiable net assets acquired, and goodwill are based on the Company's best estimate as of December 31, 2023 using information available as of the acquisition date, and are considered preliminary. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition.\nThe fair value estimates for all three acquisitions in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. Pro forma information related to these acquisitions has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisitions on the Company's consolidated financial statements was not material.\nFiscal Year 2023 - Disposal\nOn December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash proceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale followed the Companys previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its Russian business. The total net cash consideration received, excluding disposed cash and items settled net, was $365 million and resulted in a net pre-tax net gain of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company's best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the wide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business was recorded as restructuring and other related activities, net within the condensed consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a net carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million, primarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.\nNote 5 - Restructuring\nRestructuring and related expenses, net, were $24 million and $2 million during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $52 million and $3 million during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company's restructuring activities for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 were primarily comprised of restructuring activities related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan (as defined below). The Company's restructuring activities in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 related to Other Restructuring Plans (as defined below).\nRestructuring related expenses are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on its restructuring activities.\n2023 Restructuring Plan\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company announced that it will allocate approximately $110 million to $130 million of the sale proceeds from the Russian business to various cost saving initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the \"2023 Restructuring Plan\" or the \"Plan\"). The Company expects the total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses to total approximately $230 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has initiated projects with an expected net cost of approximately $210 million, of which $87 million relates to employee related expenses, $45 million to fixed asset related expenses (net of expected gains on asset disposals), $55 million to other restructuring expenses, and $23 million to restructuring related expenses. The projects initiated as of December 31, 2023 are expected to result in approximately $110 million of net cash expenditures. The Plan includes both the Flexibles and Rigid Packaging reportable segments and is expected to be largely completed by the end of calendar year 2024.\nFrom the initiation of the Plan through December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred $77 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $27 million in other restructuring, and $13 million in restructuring related expenses, with $126 million incurred in the Flexibles reportable segment and $16 million incurred in the Rigid Packaging reportable segment. The Plan has resulted in cumulative net cash outflows of $49 million. Additional cash payments of approximately $40 million to $45 million, net of estimated proceeds from disposals, are expected for the remainder of the fiscal year 2024, the majority of which relates to the Flexibles reportable segment.\nThe restructuring related costs relate primarily to the closure of facilities and include startup and training costs after relocation of equipment, and other costs incidental to the Plan.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nThe Company has entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans (\"Other Restructuring Plans\").

As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximated fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.\nThe carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its fair value. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.\nThe carrying values and estimated fair values of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding the fair value of designated receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps) were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 June 30, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\n($ in millions) (Level 2) (Level 2)\nTotal long-term debt with fixed interest rates (excluding commercial paper (1) and finance leases)\n$ 4,149 $ 3,990 $ 4,123 $ 3,844\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, the Company held interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of commercial paper equal to $1.2 billion. These contracts are considered to be economic hedges and the related $1.2 billion notional amount of commercial paper is also excluded from the total long-term debt with fixed interest rates.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAdditionally, the Company measures and records certain assets and liabilities, including derivative instruments and contingent purchase consideration liabilities, at fair value. The following table summarizes the fair value of these instruments, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by level, within the fair value hierarchy:\nDecember 31, 2023\n($ in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nCommodity contracts $ - $ 1 $ - $ 1\nForward exchange contracts - 4 - 4\nInterest rate swaps - 7 - 7\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ - $ 12 $ - $ 12\nLiabilities\nContingent purchase consideration $ - $ - $ 38 $ 38\nCommodity contracts - 1 - 1\nForward exchange contracts - 4 - 4\nInterest rate swaps - 82 - 82\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 87 $ 38 $ 125\nJune 30, 2023\n($ in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nForward exchange contracts $ - $ 3 $ - $ 3\nInterest rate swaps - 16 - 16\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ - $ 19 $ - $ 19\nLiabilities\nContingent purchase consideration $ - $ - $ 46 $ 46\nCommodity contracts - 2 - 2\nForward exchange contracts - 5 - 5\nInterest rate swaps - 96 - 96\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 103 $ 46 $ 149\nThe fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and observed market forward prices discounted at a currency specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market based swap yield curves, taking into account current interest rates.\nContingent purchase consideration liabilities arise from business acquisitions and other investments. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had contingent purchase consideration liabilities of $38 million, consisting of $27 million of contingent purchase consideration predominantly relating to fiscal year 2023 acquisitions (refer to Note 4, \"Acquisitions and Disposals\") and a $11 million liability that is contingent on future royalty income generated by Discma AG, a subsidiary acquired in March 2017. The fair values of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities were determined for each arrangement individually. The fair values were determined using an income approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the selection of discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which require adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities. Changes arising from modifications in forecasts related to contingent consideration are not expected to be material. During the three and six months ended December 31, 2023, income of $9 million was recorded in other income/(expenses), net from remeasuring the fair value of the Company's contingent purchase consideration liability.\nThe fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, generally when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, or when they are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired. These assets include goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method and other investments, long-lived assets and disposal groups held for sale, and other long-lived assets. The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no impairment charges recorded on indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill. For information on long-lived asset impairments, refer to Note 5, \"Restructuring\".\nNote 8 - Derivative Instruments\nThe Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rates, commodity prices, and currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the instruments as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its designated hedges have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates, and, where appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate locks. For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, the gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income in other income/(expenses), net.\nIn March 2023, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of $1.2 billion. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company pays a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.88% and receives a variable rate of interest, based on 1-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), from July 2023 through June 2024, settled monthly. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, the Company had no other receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swaps. Although the Company is not applying hedge accounting, the Company believes that these economic hedging instruments are effective in protecting the Company against the risks of changes in the variable interest rate on a portion of its forecasted commercial paper issuances.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, the total notional amount of the Companys receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $650 million.\nForeign Currency Risk\nThe Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.\nTo manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated statements of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $450 million and $462 million, respectively.\nCommodity Risk\nCertain raw materials used in the Company's production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables, and other unpredictable factors. The Company's policy is to minimize exposure to price volatility by passing through the commodity price risk to customers, including through the use of fixed price swaps.\nIn some cases, the Company purchases, on behalf of customers, fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exposure of price volatility on the underlying sales contracts. These instruments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost or benefit is passed through to customers. Information about commodity price exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and these exposures are hedged by central treasury units. Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income when the forecasted transaction is realized.\nThe Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts to hedge forecasted purchases:\nDecember 31, 2023 June 30, 2023\nCommodity Volume Volume\nAluminum 14,670 tons 14,325 tons\nPET resin 16,600,000 lbs. - lbs.\nThe following table provides the location of derivative instruments in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets:\n($ in millions) Balance Sheet Location December 31, 2023 June 30, 2023\nAssets\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nCommodity contracts Other current assets $ 1 $ -\nForward exchange contracts Other current assets 3 2\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForward exchange contracts Other current assets 1 1\nInterest rate swaps Other current assets 7 16\nTotal current derivative contracts 12 19\nTotal non-current derivative contracts - -\nTotal derivative asset contracts $ 12 $ 19\nLiabilities\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nCommodity contracts Other current liabilities $ 1 $ 2\nForward exchange contracts Other current liabilities 2 3\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForward exchange contracts Other current liabilities 1 1\nTotal current derivative contracts 4 6\nDerivatives in cash flow hedging relationships:\nForward exchange contracts Other non-current liabilities - 1\nDerivatives in fair value hedging relationships:\nInterest rate swaps Other non-current liabilities 82 96\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForward exchange contracts Other non-current liabilities 1 -\nTotal non-current derivative contracts 83 97\nTotal derivative liability contracts $ 87 $ 103\nCertain derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and are eligible for offset.

The Company currently acquires shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments which exposes the Company to market price risk.\nTo protect the Company from share price volatility, the Company entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that were entered into in September 2022 and mature in March 2024 to purchase 6 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.11. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that were entered into in May 2022 and September 2022 that mature between September 2023 and November 2023 to purchase 9 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.39. During the six months ended December 31, 2023, forward contracts related to 3 million shares were settled, which were outstanding as of June 30, 2023.\nThe forward contracts to purchase the Company's own shares have been included in other current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contracts.\nNote 12 - Segments\nThe Company's business is organized and presented in the two reportable segments outlined below:\nFlexibles: Consists of operations that manufacture flexible and film packaging in the food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, fresh produce, snack food, personal care, and other industries.

Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options, restricted share units, performance rights, performance shares, and share rights, if dilutive.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nNumerator\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc $ 134 $ 459 $ 286 $ 691\nDistributed and undistributed earnings attributable to shares to be repurchased (1) (3) (1) (6)\nNet income available to ordinary shareholders of Amcor plc-basic and diluted $ 133 $ 456 $ 285 $ 685\nDenominator\nWeighted-average ordinary shares outstanding 1,444 1,486 1,445 1,485\nWeighted-average ordinary shares to be repurchased by Amcor plc (5) (11) (6) (11)\nWeighted-average ordinary shares outstanding for EPS-basic 1,439 1,475 1,439 1,474\nEffect of dilutive shares 1 10 1 11\nWeighted-average ordinary shares outstanding for EPS-diluted 1,440 1,485 1,440 1,486\nPer ordinary share income\nBasic earnings per ordinary share $ 0.093 $ 0.309 $ 0.198 $ 0.465\nDiluted earnings per ordinary share $ 0.092 $ 0.307 $ 0.198 $ 0.461\nNote: Per share amounts are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. The sum of the quarters may not equal the total year amount due to the impact of changes in average quarterly shares outstanding and all other quarterly amounts may not equal the total year due to rounding.\nCertain stock awards outstanding were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share above because they would not have had a dilutive effect. The excluded stock awards for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 represented an aggregate of 35 million and 31 million shares, respectively. The excluded stock awards for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 represented an aggregate of 15 million and 12 million shares, respectively.\nNote 14 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings\nContingencies - Brazil\nThe Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company vigorously defends its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the Company's liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded accruals of $14 million, included in other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the recorded accrual of $27 million as of December 31, 2023. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company's estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company provided letters of credit of $17 million, judicial insurance of $2 million, and deposited cash of $14 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases referenced above.\nContingencies - Environmental Matters\nThe Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or may only partially, cover the total potential exposures. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded aggregate accruals of $9 million for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites.\nIn addition to the matters described above, as of December 31, 2023, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $52 million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.\nThe SEC requires the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceeding may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023.\nWhile the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOther Matters\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. While the potential financial impact with respect to these ordinary course matters is subject to many factors and uncertainties, management believes that any financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nNote 15 - Subsequent Events\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1250 per share to be paid on March 19, 2024 to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2024. Amcor has received a waiver from the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") settlement operating rules, which will allow Amcor to defer processing conversions between ordinary share and CHESS Depositary Instrument (\"CDI\") registers from February 27, 2024 to February 28, 2024, inclusive.\nOn February 6, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors extended the approval for the remaining $39 million of ordinary shares and CDIs of the $100 million buyback until June 30, 2024.\nItem 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagements Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on August 17, 2023, together with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2023, Amcor generated $14.7 billion in net sales.\nSignificant Developments Affecting the Periods Presented\nEconomic and Market Conditions\nAs anticipated, market conditions have continued to remain challenging in the first half of fiscal year 2024, with softer customer demand and increased destocking in the second quarter, particularly in December, of fiscal year 2024. We also continue to be impacted by higher inflation in certain areas, such as labor costs. In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which has resulted in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt, particularly on U.S. dollar and Euro denominated debt in the first half of fiscal year 2024 compared to the same period in fiscal year 2023.\nThe underlying causes for the continued market volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine and the Gaza-Israel conflicts and higher inflation in many economies, which have resulted in increased volatility in food and other markets and impacted global economies. In this context, we remain focused on taking price and cost actions to offset inflation, aligning our cost base with market dynamics, and managing working capital. Improved operating leverage, combined with known benefits in the second half of fiscal year 2024, which include the elimination of the earnings headwinds from the sale of the three manufacturing facilities in Russia (\"Russian business\"), a lower interest expense headwind, and the realization of structural cost reduction and productivity initiatives, is expected to result in improved earnings in the second half of fiscal year 2024. However, there is no assurance that we will meet our performance expectations or that ongoing geopolitical tensions and other factors will not negatively impact our financial results.\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict / 2023 Restructuring Plan\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of the filing of this quarterly report. In advance of the invasion, we proactively suspended operations at our small manufacturing site in Ukraine. We also operated our Russian business until its sale on December 23, 2022, for net cash proceeds of $365 million. In addition, we repatriated approximately $65 million in cash held in Russia as part of the transaction. We recorded a pre-tax net gain on sale of $215 million. The carrying value of the Russian business had previously been impaired by $90 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nOn February 7, 2023, we announced that we expect to invest $110 million to $130 million of the sale proceeds from the Russian business in various cost savings initiatives to partly offset divested earnings from the Russian business (the \"2023 Restructuring Plan\" or the \"Plan\"). We expect total Plan cash and non-cash net expenses of approximately $230 million. Of the remaining cash received from the sale of the Russian business, we allocated $100 million to the repurchase of additional shares and the remainder was used to reduce debt.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have initiated restructuring and related projects with an expected net cost of approximately $210 million, of which approximately $110 million is expected to result in net cash expenditures. From the initiation of the Plan until December 31, 2023, we have incurred $77 million in employee-related expenses, $25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $27 million in other restructuring, and $13 million in restructuring related expenses. The Plan has resulted in $49 million of cash outflows to date.\nManagement initiated other restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 to help mitigate the impact of the Russian sale. Management expects to realize an annualized pre-tax benefit of approximately $50 million from structural cost reduction actions taken as a result of all Russia related restructuring by the end of fiscal year 2025.\nFor further information, refer to Note 5, \"Restructuring,\" of Part I, \"Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\".\nHighly Inflationary Accounting\nWe have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. Following the governmental election in the three months ended December 31, 2023, Argentina devalued the Argentine Peso by approximately 55% against the U.S. dollar. As a result, highly inflationary accounting in the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted in a negative impact on monetary assets of $34 million and $5 million, respectively, and $51 million and $13 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in foreign currency transaction losses that were reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. Our operations in Argentina represented approximately 2% of our consolidated net sales and annual adjusted earnings before interest and tax in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nResults of Operations - Three Months Ended December 31, 2023\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 3,251 $ 3,642\nOperating income 242 559\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales 7.4 % 15.3 %\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc $ 134 $ 459\nDiluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.092 $ 0.307\nNet sales decreased by $391 million, or 11%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the positive currency impacts of $72 million, the negative impacts from the pass-through of lower raw material costs of approximately $30 million, and the negative impact from the disposed Russian business of $85 million, the remaining variation in net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was a decrease of $348 million, or 10%, reflecting lower volumes.\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc decreased by $325 million, or 71%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to the non-recurrence of a pre-tax net gain of $215 million on disposal of the Russian business in the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease in gross profit of $41 million, a decrease in other income of $34 million, an increase in restructuring and related expenses, net, of $22 million, and higher net interest expense of $10 million.\nDiluted earnings per share (\"Diluted EPS\") decreased by $0.215, or 70%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, with the net income available to ordinary shareholders of Amcor plc decreasing by 71% due to the above items and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding decreasing by 3%. The decrease in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding was largely due to the repurchase of shares under previously announced share buyback programs.\nSegment Results of Operations\nFlexibles Segment\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 2,481 $ 2,812\nAdjusted EBIT 312 353\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of net sales 12.6 % 12.6 %\nNet sales decreased by $331 million, or 12%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the positive currency impacts of $63 million, the negative impacts from the pass-through of lower raw material costs of approximately $45 million, and the negative impact from the disposed Russian business of $85 million, the remaining variation in net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was a decrease of $264 million, or 9%, reflecting sales from acquired businesses of 1% and unfavorable volumes of 10% as a result of persistently broad based lower market and customer demand as well as accelerated destocking, particularly in December.\nAdjusted earnings before interest and tax (\"Adjusted EBIT\") decreased by $41 million or 12% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding positive currency impacts of $6 million and the negative net impact from the disposed Russian business of $29 million, the remaining decrease in Adjusted EBIT for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $18 million, or 5%, reflecting the net negative effect of 6% from unfavorable volumes and favorable operating cost performance, partially offset by favorable price/mix of 1%.\nRigid Packaging Segment\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 770 $ 830\nAdjusted EBIT 51 57\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of net sales 6.6 % 6.9 %\nNet sales decreased by $60 million, or 7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the positive currency impacts of $10 million and the positive impact from the pass-through of higher raw material costs of approximately $15 million, the remaining variation in net sales for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was a decrease of $85 million, or 10%, reflecting price/mix benefits of 2% and unfavorable volumes of 12% predominantly reflecting an incremental weaker consumer and customer demand and significant destocking.\nAdjusted EBIT decreased by $6 million, or 11%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the positive currency impacts of $1 million, the remaining variation in Adjusted EBIT for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was a decrease of $7 million, or 12%, reflecting the net negative effect of 29% from unfavorable volumes and favorable operating cost performance, partly offset by favorable price/mix of 17%.\nConsolidated Gross Profit\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nGross profit $ 621 $ 662\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales 19.1 % 18.2 %\nGross profit decreased by $41 million, or 6%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the disposed Russian business and lower volumes. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 19.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, driven by an improvement in operating cost performance.\nConsolidated Research And Development Expenses\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nResearch and development expenses $ (28) $ (24)\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of net sales (0.9 %) (0.7 %)\nResearch and development expenses increased by $4 million, or 17%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to continued investment in our research and development organization to further progress towards our innovation and sustainability goals.\nConsolidated Restructuring and Other Related Activities, Net\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nRestructuring and other related activities, net $ (24) $ 213\nRestructuring and other related activities, net, as a percentage of net sales (0.7 %) 5.8 %\nRestructuring and other related activities, net, changed by $237 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The change was mainly a result of a pre-tax net gain of $215 million on the disposal of the Russian business in three months ended December 31, 2022 and an increase in restructuring and related expenses, net, of $22 million, primarily related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan.\nConsolidated Other Income/(Expenses), Net\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nOther income/(expenses), net $ (28) $ 6\nOther income/(expenses), net as a percentage of net sales (0.9 %) 0.2 %\nOther income/(expenses), net changed by $34 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily from the adverse impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nInterest expense $ (89) $ (79)\nInterest expense as a percentage of net sales (2.7 %) (2.2 %)\nInterest expense increased by $10 million, or 13%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by increased variable interest rates.\nConsolidated Income Tax Expense\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nIncome tax expense $ (28) $ (33)\nEffective income tax rate 17.0 % 6.7 %\nThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for the respective fiscal years, and is applied on income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated companies, and adjusted for specific items that are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred.\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased by 10.3 percentage points compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the difference in the magnitude of discrete events in both periods, mainly driven by tax benefits attributable to the disposal of the Russian business in the three months ended December 31, 2022.\nResults of Operations - Six Months Ended December 31, 2023\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 6,694 $ 7,354\nOperating income $ 512 $ 901\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales 7.6 % 12.3 %\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc $ 286 $ 691\nDiluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.198 $ 0.461\nNet sales decreased by $660 million, or 9%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. Excluding the positive currency impacts of $154 million, the negative impacts from the pass-through of lower raw material costs of approximately $85 million, and the negative impact from the disposed Russian business of $156 million, the remaining decrease in net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2023 was $573 million, or 8%, reflecting favorable price/mix of 1% and unfavorable volumes of 9%.\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc decreased by $405 million, or 59%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022, mainly due to the non-recurrence of the pre-tax net gain of $215 million on disposal of the Russian business in the six months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease in gross profit of $64 million, a decrease in other income of $54 million, an increase in restructuring and related expenses, net, of $49 million, and higher net interest expense of $35 million.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased by $0.263, or 57%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022, with the net income available to ordinary shareholders of Amcor plc decreasing by 58% due to the above items and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding decreasing by 3% for the six months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding was due to the repurchase of shares under previously announced share buyback programs.\nSegment Results of Operations\nFlexibles Segment\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nNet sales $ 5,049 $ 5,591\nAdjusted EBIT $ 634 $ 706\nAdjusted EBIT as a percentage of net sales 12.6 % 12.6 %\nNet sales decreased by $542 million, or 10%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022.

The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the disposed Russian business and lower volumes. Gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 18.9% for the six months ended December 31, 2023, driven by favorable price/mix and an improvement in operating cost performance.\nConsolidated Research And Development Expenses\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nResearch and development expenses $ (55) $ (49)\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of net sales (0.8 %) (0.7 %)\nResearch and development expenses increased by $6 million, or 12%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022.

The change was mainly a result of a pre-tax net gain of $215 million on the disposal of the Russian business in the six months ended December 31, 2022, and an increase in restructuring and related expenses, net, of $49 million, primarily related to the 2023 Restructuring Plan.\nConsolidated Other Income/(Expenses), Net\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nOther income/(expenses), net $ (46) $ 8\nOther income/(expenses), net as a percentage of net sales (0.7 %) 0.1 %\nOther income/(expenses), net changed by $54 million, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily from the adverse impact of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso.\nConsolidated Interest Expense\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nInterest expense $ (174) $ (138)\nInterest expense as a percentage of net sales (2.6 %) (1.9 %)\nInterest expense increased by $36 million, or 26%, for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022, driven primarily by increased variable interest rates.\nConsolidated Income Tax Expense\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nIncome tax expense $ (67) $ (91)\nEffective income tax rate 18.7 % 11.6 %\nThe provision for income taxes for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for the respective fiscal years, and is applied on income before income taxes and equity in loss of affiliated companies and adjusted for specific items that are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred.\nThe effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased by 7.1 percentage points compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the difference in the magnitude of discrete events in both periods, mainly driven by tax benefits attributable to the disposal of the Russian business in the six months ended December 31, 2022.\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Information\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (\"Adjusted EBIT\"), earnings before interest and tax (\"EBIT\"), adjusted net income, and net debt. Such measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery, certain regulatory and litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction and integration expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of contingent acquisition payments and economic hedging instruments on commercial paper, and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Note that while amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted financial measures, the revenue of the acquired entities and all other expenses unless otherwise stated, are reflected in Adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income and the acquired assets contribute to revenue generation.\nThis adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.\nA reconciliation of reported net income attributable to Amcor plc to Adjusted EBIT, and adjusted net income for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet income attributable to Amcor plc, as reported $ 134 $ 459 $ 286 $ 691\nAdd: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 2 2 4 4\nNet income 136 461 290 695\nAdd: Income tax expense 28 33 67 91\nAdd: Interest expense 89 79 174 138\nLess: Interest income (11) (11) (21) (20)\nEBIT 242 562 510 904\nAdd: Amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combinations (1) 43 40 83 80\nAdd: Impact of hyperinflation (2) 34 5 51 13\nAdd/(Less): Restructuring and other related activities, net (3) 24 (207) 52 (204)\nAdd/(Less): Other (4) 9 (1) 13 (2)\nAdjusted EBIT $ 352 $ 399 $ 709 $ 791\nLess: Income tax expense (28) (33) (67) (91)\nLess: Adjustments to income tax expense (5) (17) (19) (32) (30)\nLess: Interest expense (89) (79) (174) (138)\nAdd: Interest income 11 11 21 20\nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (2) (2) (4) (4)\nAdjusted net income $ 227 $ 277 $ 453 $ 548\n(1)Amortization of acquired intangible assets from business combinations includes amortization expenses related to all acquired intangible assets from past acquisitions.\n(2)Impact of hyperinflation includes the adverse impact of highly inflationary accounting for subsidiaries in Argentina where the functional currency was the Argentine Peso.\n(3)Restructuring and other related activities, net includes incremental costs incurred in connection with the Russia-Ukraine conflict in fiscal year 2023.\n(4)Other includes various expense and income items relating to acquisitions, retroactive foil duties, certain litigation reserve settlements, and fair value movements on economic hedges.\n(5)Net tax impact on items (1) through (4) above.\nReconciliation of Net Debt\nA reconciliation of total debt to net debt as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 is as follows:\n($ in millions) December 31, 2023 June 30, 2023\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 12 $ 13\nShort-term debt 46 80\nLong-term debt, less current portion 7,011 6,653\nTotal debt 7,069 6,746\nLess cash and cash equivalents 430 689\nNet debt $ 6,639 $ 6,057\nSupplemental Guarantor Information\nAmcor plc, along with certain wholly owned subsidiary guarantors, guarantee the following senior notes issued by the wholly owned subsidiaries, Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc. and Amcor UK Finance plc.\n$500 million, 4.000%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2025 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n$300 million, 3.100%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2026 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n$600 million, 3.625%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2026 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n$500 million, 4.500%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2028 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n$500 million, 2.630%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2030 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n$800 million, 2.690%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2031 of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc.\n\u20ac500 million, 1.125%, Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2027 of Amcor UK Finance plc\n$500 million, 5.625% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2033 of Amcor Finance (USA), Inc.\nThe six notes issued by Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc. are guaranteed by its parent entity, Amcor plc, and the subsidiary guarantors Amcor Pty Ltd, Amcor Finance (USA), Inc., and Amcor UK Finance plc.

Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\".\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Judgments\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates and judgments as of December 31, 2023 from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources.\nWe believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future.\nOverview\nSix Months Ended December 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 228 $ 145\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (256) 24\nNet cash used in financing activities (191) (90)\nCash Flow Overview\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $83 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by lower working capital outflows more than offsetting lower net income in the current period.\nNet Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $280 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by the disposal proceeds collected from the sale of the Russian business in the prior period, partially offset by lower outflows for investments in affiliated companies and business acquisitions compared to the prior period.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $101 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily driven by lower net debt drawdowns in the current period.\nNet Debt\nWe borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings.\nIn March 2023, we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of $1.2 billion. Under the terms of the contracts, we pay a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 3.88% and receive a variable rate of interest based on 1-month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). The swaps have been effective as of July 1, 2023, and mature on June 30, 2024. The interest rate swap contracts economically hedge the SOFR component of our forecasted commercial paper issuances.\nShort-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.\nOur primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to 10.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities.\nOur net debt as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 was $6.6 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.\nDebt Facilities\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $1.0 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates. These facilities mature in April 2025 and April 2027, respectively, and the revolving tranches have two 12-month options available to us to extend the maturity date.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities). Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under each agreement to be increased by up to $500 million.\nDividend Payments\nWe declared and paid a $0.1225 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a $0.1250 cash dividend per ordinary share during the three months ended December 31, 2023.\nCredit Rating\nOur capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets, and from global financial institutions.\nShare Repurchases\nOn February 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $100 million buyback of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments (\"CDIs\") in the following twelve months. On February 6, 2024, our Board of Directors extended the approval for the remaining $39 million of ordinary shares and CDIs of the $100 million buyback until June 30, 2024. During the six months ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased approximately $30 million of ordinary shares and CDIs in the aggregate, including transaction costs, or 3 million shares. The shares repurchased as part of the program were canceled upon repurchase.\nWe had cash outflows of $48 million and $221 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market and using forward contracts to purchase our own equity during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, we held treasury shares at a cost of $11 million and $12 million, respectively, representing 1 million shares.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThere have been no material changes in our market risk during the three months ended December 31, 2023. For additional information, refer to Note 7, \"Fair Value Measurements,\" and Note 8, \"Derivative Instruments,\" in the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, and to \"Item 7A. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2023. The term \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1.
