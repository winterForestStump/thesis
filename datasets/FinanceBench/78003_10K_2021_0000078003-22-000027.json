    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nABOUT PFIZER\nPfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.\nMost of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients, through improved treatment of diseases, improvements in health, wellness and productivity as well as by reducing other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization. We seek to enhance the value of our medicines and vaccines and actively engage in dialogues about how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We seek to maximize patient access and evaluate our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers to minimize adverse impact on our revenues within the current legal and pricing structures.\nWe are committed to fulfilling our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients lives. Our purpose fuels everything we do and reflects both our passion for science and our commitment to patients. Pfizers growth strategy is driven by five Bold Moves that help us deliver breakthroughs for patients and create value for shareholders and other stakeholders:\n1.Unleash the power of our people;\n2.Deliver first-in-class science;\n3.Transform our go-to-market model;\n4.Win the digital race in pharma; and\n5.Lead the conversation.\nIn addition, Pfizer continues to enhance its ESG strategy, which is focused on six areas where we see opportunities to create a meaningful impact over the next decade: product innovation; equitable access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; climate change; and business ethics.\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\nOur significant recent business development activities in 2021 include, among others: (i) the July 2021 global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC\u00ae (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader (the estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers); (ii) the November 2021 collaboration and license agreement with Biohaven to acquire rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S. upon approval; (iii) the November 2021 acquisition of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of cancer; and (iv) the December 2021 research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beams in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. In addition, in December 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions. For a further discussion of our strategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A and Note 2.\nIn 2020 and 2021, our business, operations and financial condition and results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To confront the public health challenge posed by the pandemic, we have made some important advances, including, the development of a vaccine to help prevent\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 3\nCOVID-19 and an oral COVID-19 treatment. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&A and the   ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe own and lease space globally for sales and marketing, customer service, regulatory compliance, R&D, manufacturing and distribution and corporate enabling functions. In many locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. Our global headquarters are located in New York City. We continue to advance our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces that enable collaboration and foster innovation. As of December 31, 2021, we had 327 owned and leased properties, amounting to approximately 41 million square feet.\nWe expect to relocate our global headquarters to the Spiral, an office building in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City, with occupancy expected beginning in the second half of 2022. In April 2018, we entered into an agreement to lease space at this property. In July 2018, we completed the sale of our current headquarters in New York City. We remain in a lease-back arrangement with the buyer while we complete our relocation.\nOur PGS platform function is headquartered in various locations, with leadership teams primarily in New York City and in Peapack, New Jersey. As of December 31, 2021, PGS had responsibility for 39 plants around the world, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the U.S., which manufacture products for our business. PGS expects to exit three of these sites over the next several years. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world.\nIn general, we believe that our properties, including the principal properties described above, are well-maintained, adequate and suitable for their current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future. See Note 9 for amounts invested in land, buildings and equipment. ITEM 3.

[RESERVED]\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 25\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of certain financial performance metrics (in billions, except per share data):\n2021 Total Revenues--$81.3 billion 2021 Net Cash Flow from Operations--$32.6 billion\nAn increase of 95% compared to 2020 An increase of 126% compared to 2020\n2021 Reported Diluted EPS--$3.85 2021 Adjusted Diluted EPS (Non-GAAP)--$4.42*\nAn increase of 137% compared to 2020 An increase of 96% compared to 2020\n*For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&A.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOur Business and Strategy\nMost of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business--Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 75% has been incurred since inception and through December 31, 2021. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nTransforming to a More Focused Company: We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. See the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&A.\nR&D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 26\nproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business-Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&D priorities and strategy.\nWe seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\nan aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients unmet needs;\nadvances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\nthe increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\nOur Business Development Initiatives\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\nAcquisition of Arena\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\nCollaboration with Biohaven\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec\u00ae ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to ex-U.S. sales.\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2.\nOur 2021 Performance\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 17C.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 27\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income\nThe increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $17.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to: (i) higher revenues, (ii) net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020, (iii) lower asset impairment charges, and (iv) higher net gains on equity securities, partially offset by (v) increases in: Cost of sales, Research and development expenses and Selling, informational and administrative expenses.\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4 for additional information.\nFor information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&A and Note 5.\nOur Operating Environment\nWe, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity\nOur product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a products overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a products labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\nThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.\nRegulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures\nThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities if they go into effect. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business--Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and --Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.\nProduct Supply\nWe periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions or shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent Chantix recall. For information on our recent Chantix recall and risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section in this Form 10-K.\nThe Global Economic Environment\nIn addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions including inflation, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 28\nproduction, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results.\nOur Response to COVID-19\nPfizer has helped lead the global effort to confront the COVID-19 pandemic by advancing a vision for industry-wide collaboration while making significant investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing.\nComirnaty/BNT162b2:\n\u25e6We have collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty/BNT162b2, a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19. The FDA has approved Comirnaty in the U.S. to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older as a two-dose primary series (30 \u00b5g per dose). Comirnaty is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be granted approval by the FDA and had previously been available to this patient population in the U.S. under an EUA since December 2020. The vaccine is also available to individuals 5 to 15 years old under an EUA granted by the FDA in 2021 (10 \u00b5g per dose for children 5 through 11 years of age (October 2021) and 30 \u00b5g per dose for individuals 12 years of age and older (May 2021)). The FDA has also authorized for emergency use: (i) a third dose of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 in certain immunocompromised individuals 5 years of age and older and (ii) Comirnaty/BNT162b2 as a booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has also been granted an approval or an authorization in many other countries around the world in populations varying by country. We continue to evaluate our vaccine, including for additional pediatric indications, and the short- and long-term efficacy of Comirnaty. We are also studying vaccine candidates to potentially prevent COVID-19 caused by new and emerging variants, such as the Omicron variant, or an updated vaccine as needed.\n\u25e6In 2021, we manufactured more than three billion doses and, in fiscal 2021, delivered 2.2 billion doses around the world. Pfizer and BioNTech expect we can manufacture up to four billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The companies have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty in 2022 with multiple developed and emerging countries around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty to governments under such agreements. We also signed agreements with multiple countries to supply Comirnaty doses in 2023 and are currently negotiating similar potential agreements with multiple other countries. We anticipate delivering at least two billion doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022-one billion that was delivered in 2021 and one billion expected to be delivered in 2022, with the possibility to increase those deliveries if more orders are placed by these countries for 2022. One billion of the aforementioned doses to low- and middle-income countries are being supplied to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price to be donated to the worlds poorest nations at no charge to those countries.\n\u25e6As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $32 billion in revenues for Comirnaty in 2022, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, which includes doses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed as of late-January 2022.\nPaxlovid:\n\u25e6In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid, a novel oral COVID-19 treatment, which is a SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor and is co-administered with a low dose of ritonavir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The FDA based its decision on clinical data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients), which enrolled non-hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. Paxlovid has been granted an authorization or approval in many other countries.\n\u25e6We continue to evaluate Paxlovid in other populations, including in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at standard risk (i.e., low risk of hospitalization or death) (Phase 2/3 EPIC-SR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard Risk Patients)) and in adults living in the same household as someone with a confirmed COVID-19 infection (Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)).\n\u25e6We have entered into agreements with multiple countries to supply pre-specified courses of Paxlovid, such as the U.S. and U.K., and have initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 countries around the world. Additionally, we have signed a voluntary non-exclusive license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) for Paxlovid. Under the terms of the agreement, MPP can grant sublicenses to qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide to manufacture and supply Paxlovid to 95 low- and middle-income countries, covering up to approximately 53% of the worlds population.\n\u25e6Pfizer plans to manufacture up to 120 million treatment courses by the end of 2022, depending on the global need, which will be driven by advance purchase agreements, with 30 million courses expected to be produced in the first half of 2022 and the remaining 90 million courses expected to be produced in the second half of 2022.\n\u25e6As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $22 billion of revenues for Paxlovid in 2022, which includes treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022, primarily relating to supply contracts signed or committed as of late-January 2022.\nIV Protease Inhibitor:\n\u25e6In February 2022, we discontinued the global clinical development program for PF-07304814, an intravenously administered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor being evaluated in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19. This decision was made based on a totality of information, including a careful review of early data and a thorough assessment of the candidates potential to successfully fulfill patient needs. Dosing of PF-07304814 in the National Institutes of Healths ongoing Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-3 study has ceased.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations\nAs part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic,\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 29\nas well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, R&D and corporate enabling functions globally.\nApart from our introduction of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. Our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021. For example, certain of our vaccines such as the Prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to COVID-19, including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19. For some products such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, we continued to see postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to COVID-19, which may subside in 2022 as COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates continue to increase and/or if COVID-19 cases subside. On the other hand, some products such as Ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets. For detail on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our products, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income-Revenues by Geography and Revenues-Selected Product Discussion sections within this MD&A.\nIn 2021, engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to pre-pandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform in-person engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and communities. As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer, we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches. During the pandemic, we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement. Most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to temporarily work remotely, while certain colleagues in the PGS and WRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission. As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception. Also, in 2021 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. However, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply, which could have a future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. Certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which included, in some cases, challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants and accruing cases in certain studies. Our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation, such as decentralized visits (e.g., telemedicine and home visits) to accommodate participants ability to maintain scheduled visits, as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies.\nWe will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results.\nFor additional information, please see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-COVID-19 Pandemic section of this Form 10-K.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nFollowing is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1D.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions (Note 1E); Fair Value (Note 1F); Revenues (Note 1H); Asset Impairments (Note 1M); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1Q); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans (Note 1R); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (Note 1S).\nFor a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans, see Notes 1B and 1C.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see Note 1E. Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below.\nRevenues\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 30\nbetween the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each individual product. For further information, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1H.\nAsset Impairments\nWe review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in Note 1M.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.\nAn expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitors product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nWe use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, other than goodwill. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows.\nWhile all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2021) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2021 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.\nIn our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.\nWhen we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nFor all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results and the Item 1A. Risk Factors sections in this Form 10-K.\nBenefit Plans\nFor a description of our different benefit plans, see Note 11.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 31\nThe following provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on plan assets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end of each year for our U.S. pension plans and our international pension plans(a):\n2021 2020 2019\nU.S. Pension Plans\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 6.3 % 6.8 % 7.0 %\nActual annual rate of return on plan assets 9.2 14.1 22.6\nDiscount rate used to measure the plan obligations 2.9 2.6 3.3\nInternational Pension Plans\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 3.1 3.4 3.6\nActual annual rate of return on plan assets 11.4 9.7 10.7\nDiscount rate used to measure the plan obligations 1.6 1.5 1.7\n(a)For detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see Note 11B.\nExpected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans.\nThe expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):\nAssumption Change Increase in 2022\nNet Periodic\nBenefit Costs\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 50 basis point decline $133\nThe actual return on plan assets was approximately $2.6 billion during 2021.\nDiscount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements. The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):\nAssumption Change Decrease in 2022 Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nIncrease to 2021 Benefit Obligations\nDiscount rate 10 basis point decline $16 $442\nThe change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $786 million.\nIncome Tax Assets and Liabilities\nIncome tax assets and liabilities include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions. For additional information, see Notes 1Q and 5, as well as the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.\nContingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax, legal contingencies and guarantees and indemnifications. For additional information, see Notes 1Q, 1S, 5D and 16.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 32\nANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following presents worldwide revenues by geography:\nYear Ended December 31, % Change\nWorldwide U.S. International Worldwide U.S. International\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 21/20 20/19 21/20 20/19 21/20 20/19\nOperating segments:\nBiopharma\n$ 79,557 $ 40,724 $ 38,013 $ 29,221 $ 21,055 $ 18,901 $ 50,336 $ 19,670 $ 19,112 95 7 39 11 156 3\nPfizer CentreOne 1,731 926 810 524 400 437 1,206 526 374 87 14 31 (8) 129 41\nConsumer Healthcare\n- - 2,082 - - 988 - - 1,094 - (100) - (100) - (100)\nTotal revenues $ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905 $ 29,746 $ 21,455 $ 20,326 $ 51,542 $ 20,196 $ 20,579 95 2 39 6 155 (2)\n2021 v. 2020\nThe following provides an analysis of the change in worldwide revenues by geographic areas in 2021:\n(MILLIONS) Worldwide U.S. International\nOperational growth/(decline):\nGrowth from Comirnaty, Eliquis, Biosimilars, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by a decline from the Prevnar family, while Xeljanz and Ibrance were flat.

The relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from Eliquis, the Prevnar family, Ibrance and Zavicefta, offset by lower revenues for Consumer Healthcare, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction.\nRevenue Deductions\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues.

Prior to BLA, Comirnaty/BNT162b2 for ages 16 and up was available in the U.S. pursuant to an EUA from the FDA on December 11, 2020. In December 2021, a supplemental BLA was submitted to the FDA requesting to expand the approval of Comirnaty to include individuals ages 12 through 15 years. In February 2022, following a request from the FDA, a rolling submission seeking to amend the EUA to include children 6 months through 4 years of age (6 months to <5 years of age) was initiated as we wait for data evaluating a third 3 \u00b5g dose given at least two months after the second dose of the two-dose series in this age group. A booster dose received EUA from the FDA on September 22, 2021 for individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and individuals 18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, in October 2021, the FDA authorized for emergency use a booster dose to eligible individuals who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Subsequently, the FDA expanded the booster EUA: (i) in November 2021 to include individuals 18 years of age and older, (ii) in December 2021 to include individuals 16 years of age and older and (iii) in January 2022 to include individuals 12 years of age and older as well as individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. A booster dose received conditional marketing authorization from the EMA in October 2021 for individuals 18 years of age and older and may be given to individuals 5 years and older with a severely weakened immune system, at least 28 days after their second dose. A booster dose received approval in Japan in November 2021 for 18 years of age and older.\n(b)Being developed in collaboration with Merck KGaA, Germany.\n(c)Being developed in collaboration with Astellas.\n(d)Being developed in collaboration with Myovant.\n(e)Being developed in collaboration with OPKO. In January 2022, Pfizer and OPKO received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for the BLA for somatrogon. Pfizer is evaluating the CRL and will work with the FDA to determine an appropriate path forward in the U.S.\n(f)In October 2021, the CDCs ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use in adults. Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend the following: (i) adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV20) or pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV15)). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23); and (ii) adults aged 19 years of age or older with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. The\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 39\nrecommendations were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on January 28, 2022. The publication also notes for adults who have received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) but have not completed their recommended pneumococcal vaccine series with PPSV23, one dose of Prevnar 20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available.\n(g)In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. In January 2022, the EMA approved the CMA of Paxlovid for treating COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe.\n(h)Under a commercialization arrangement with Biohaven.\nIn September 2021, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) related to Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR and two competitors arthritis medicines in the same drug class, based on its completed review of the ORAL Surveillance trial. The DSC stated that the FDA will require revisions to the Boxed Warnings for each of these medicines to include information about the risks of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. In addition, the DSC indicated the FDAs intention to limit approved uses of these products to certain patients who have not responded or cannot tolerate one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. In December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. In addition, at the request of the EC, the PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating to oral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, which is ongoing. For additional information, see Item 1A.

While avelumab showed clinical activity in this population, the study did not meet the primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival in the high PD-L1+population for either of the avelumab dosing regimens evaluated. The safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program. Avelumab is not approved for the treatment of any patients with NSCLC. The outcome of the JAVELIN Lung 100 trial has no bearing on any of avelumabs currently-approved indications. Full results of the study will be shared at a future date.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, enrollment was stopped in C4591015 Study (a Phase 2/3 placebo controlled randomized observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older). This study was developed prior to availability or recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women. The environment changed during 2021 and by September 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were recommended by applicable recommending bodies (e.g., ACIP in the U.S.) for pregnant women in all participating/planned countries, and as a result the enrollment rate declined significantly. With the declining enrollment, the study had insufficient sample size to assess the primary immunogenicity objective and continuation of this placebo controlled study could no longer be justified due to global recommendations. This proposal was shared with and agreed to by FDA and EMA.\nFor additional information about our R&D organization, see the Item 1.

We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:\nMeasure Definition Relevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance\nAdjusted income Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nbefore the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\nProvides investors useful information to:\n\u25e6evaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their components, on a comparable year-over-year basis\n\u25e6assist in modeling expected future performance on a normalized basis\nProvides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management(b)\nAdjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses, Adjusted amortization of intangible assets and Adjusted other (income)/deductions--net\nCost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other (income)/deductions--net (a), each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are components of the Adjusted income measure\nAdjusted diluted EPS EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted (a) before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\n(a)Most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(b)The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part by three metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS, which is derived from Adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, may be modified by our R&D performance as measured by four metrics relating to our pipeline and may be further modified by our Compensation Committees assessment of other factors.\nAdjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders, components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders-diluted, respectively. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information-certain line items for 2021, 2020 and 2019 below.\nWe also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 41\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.\nThe exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&D costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.\nAcquisition-Related Items\nAdjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAdjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\nCertain Significant Items\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.\nBeginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 42\nReconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 30,821 $ 12,703 $ 13,829 $ 3,700 $ (4,878) $ 21,979 $ 3.85\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n25 (3) 6 (3,088) (114) 3,175\nAcquisition-related items - - - - - 52\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - 585\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(108) (450) (1) - - 1,309\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (86) 86\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (1,056) - - 1,056\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 1,338 (1,338)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - 1,601 (1,601)\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (2,240) - - 2,240\nOther (52) (141) (15) - (334) (i)\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (2,848)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 30,685 $ 12,110 $ 10,523 $ 613 $ (2,473) $ 25,236 $ 4.42\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 8,484 $ 11,597 $ 9,393 $ 3,348 $ 1,219 $ 9,159 $ 1.63\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n18 (2) 5 (3,064) (75) 3,117\nAcquisition-related items - - - - - 44\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - (2,879)\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(61) (197) 2 - - 791\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (1,691) 1,691\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (454) - - 454\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 557 (557)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - (1,092) 1,092\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (50) - - 50\nOther (56) (292) (j)\n(24) - (697) (i)\n1,063\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (1,299)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 8,386 $ 11,106 $ 8,872 $ 284 $ (1,779) $ 12,727 $ 2.26\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 43\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 8,054 $ 12,726 $ 8,385 $ 4,429 $ 3,497 $ 16,026 $ 2.82\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n19 2 4 (4,158) (21) 4,153\nAcquisition-related items - (2) - - - 185\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - (6,056)\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(89) (73) (30) - - 611\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (2,757) 2,757\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (279) - - 279\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 415 (415)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - (750) 750\n(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction - - - - - (8,107)\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (337) - - 337\nOther (118) (190) (18) - (1,007) (i)\n1,333\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (797)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 7,865 $ 12,463 $ 7,726 $ 271 $ (623) $ 11,056 $ 1.95\n(a)Items that reconcile GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted balances are shown pre-tax and include discontinued operations. Our effective tax rates for GAAP reported income from continuing operations were: 7.6% in 2021, 5.3% in 2020 and 5.2% in 2019. See Note 5. Our effective tax rates on Non-GAAP adjusted income were: 15.3% in 2021, 13.7% in 2020 and 16.0% in 2019.\n(b)Purchase accounting adjustments include items such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. For all years presented, primarily consists of amortization of intangible assets.\n(c)Relates primarily to the spin-off of our Upjohn Business, and our sale of Meridian. See Note 2B.\n(d)Includes employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs related to our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives not associated with acquisitions. See Note 3.\n(e)Primarily includes intangible asset impairment charges. For 2020, $900 million is related to IPR&D assets acquired from Array and $528 million is related to Eucrisa. For 2019, $2.6 billion is related to Eucrisa. See Note 4.\n(f)Primarily includes the following charges: (i) for 2021, an upfront payment to Arvinas and a premium paid on our equity investment in Arvinas totaling $706 million, a $300 million upfront payment to Beam and a $50 million net upfront payment to BioNTech; (ii) for 2020, a payment of $151 million representing the expense portion of an upfront payment to Myovant, an upfront payment to Valneva of $130 million, an upfront payment to BioNTech and a premium paid on our equity investment in BioNTech totaling $98 million, as well as a $75 million milestone payment to Akcea; and (iii) for 2019, an upfront license fee payment of $250 million to Akcea.\n(g)(Gains)/losses on equity securities, and actuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses are removed from adjusted earnings due to their inherent market volatility.\n(h)Primarily includes payments for acquired IPR&D. For 2021, includes a $2.1 billion charge related to our acquisition of Trillium, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition, and a $177 million charge related to an asset acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2021. For 2019, included a $337 million charge related to our acquisition of Therachon, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n(i)For 2021, the total of $334 million primarily includes: (i) charges representing our equity-method accounting pro rata share of restructuring charges and costs of preparing for separation from GSK of $185 million recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV and (ii) charges for certain legal matters of $162 million. For 2020, the total of $697 million primarily included: (i) charges of $367 million, which represent our equity-method accounting pro rata share of transaction-specific restructuring and business combination accounting charges recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV, and (ii) losses on asset disposals of $238 million. For 2019, the total of $1.0 billion primarily included: (i) $300 million of business and legal entity alignment costs for consulting, legal, tax and advisory services associated with the design, planning and implementation of our then new business structure, effective in the beginning of 2019, (ii) charges for certain legal matters of $291 million, (iii) charges of $152 million for external incremental costs, such as transaction costs and costs to separate our Consumer Healthcare business into a separate legal entity associated with the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV, (iv) net losses on early retirement of debt of $138 million and (v) charges of $112 million representing our equity-method accounting pro rata share of restructuring and business combination accounting charges recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n(j)For 2020, amounts in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of $292 million primarily include costs for consulting, legal, tax and advisory services associated with a non-recurring internal reorganization of legal entities.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 44\nANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nCash Flows from Continuing Operations\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019 Drivers of change\nCash provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities from continuing operations $ 32,922 $ 10,540 $ 7,015 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven primarily by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, the payment for the acquisition of Trillium, a decrease in contributions to pension plans, and the impact of timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, mostly from an increase in cash flows from Other current liabilities driven by: (i) a $9.7 billion accrual for the gross profit split due to BioNTech, (ii) an increase in royalties payable, as well as (iii) an increase in deferred revenues for advance payments in 2021 for Comirnaty.\nThe change in Other Adjustments, net, is mostly due to an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mainly by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, advanced payments in 2020 for Comirnaty recorded in deferred revenue, the upfront cash payment associated with our acquisition of Therachon in 2019, and the upfront cash payment associated with our licensing agreement with Akcea in 2019, partially offset by an increase in benefit plan contributions.\nThe change also reflects the impact of timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.\nThe change in Other adjustments, net was driven primarily by an increase in equity method dividends received, partially offset by an increase in equity income and increases in net unrealized gains on equity securities.\nInvesting activities from continuing operations $ (22,534) $ (4,162) $ (3,825) 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven mainly by a $24.7 billion increase in purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months and a $9.0 billion increase in net purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less, partially offset by a $16.4 billion increase in redemptions of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mostly by a $6.0 billion decrease in net proceeds from short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and $2.7 billion in net purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months in 2020 (compared to $2.3 billion net proceeds from short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months in 2019), partially offset by the cash used to acquire Array, net of cash acquired, of $10.9 billion in 2019.\nFinancing activities from continuing operations $ (9,816) $ (21,640) $ (8,485) 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven mostly by a $9.8 billion net reduction in repayments of short-term borrowings with maturities of greater than three months, a $4.0 billion decrease in net payments on short-term borrowings with maturities of three months or less and a $2.0 billion reduction in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a $4.2 billion decrease in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mostly by $14.0 billion net payments of short-term borrowings in 2020 (compared to $10.6 billion net proceeds raised from short-term borrowings in 2019) and an increase in cash dividends paid of $397 million, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of common stock of $8.9 billion, lower repayments on long-term debt of $2.8 billion, and an increase in issuances of long-term debt of $280 million.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nCash flows from discontinued operations primarily relate to our former Meridian subsidiary, Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration (see Note 2B). In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations primarily reflects issuances of long-term debt.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK\nDue to our significant operating cash flows, which is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source, as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 45\nWe focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital. Excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities which consist of primarily high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified debt securities. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.\nAdditionally, we may obtain funding through short-term or long-term sources from our access to the capital markets, banking relationships and relationships with other financial intermediaries to meet our liquidity needs.\nDiverse sources of funds: Related disclosure presented in this Form 10-K\nInternal sources:\nOperating cash flows\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows - Operating Activities and the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within MD&A\nCash and cash equivalents\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nMoney market funds\nNote 7A\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nNote 7A, 7B\nExternal sources:\nShort-term funding:\nCommercial paper\nNote 7C\nRevolving credit facilities\nNote 7C\nLines of credit\nNote 7C\nLong-term funding:\nLong-term debt\nNote 7D\nEquity\nConsolidated Statements of Equity and Note 12\nFor additional information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this MD&A.\nIn August 2021, we completed a public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes. We are using the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part as follows: R&D expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccines, capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and our other projects that have environmental and/or social benefits. For additional information, see Note 7D.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and increases or decreases in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moodys. In November 2020, upon the completion of the Upjohn separation, both Moodys and S&P lowered our long-term debt rating one notch to \u2018A2 and \u2018A+, respectively, and our short-term rating remained unchanged. S&P continues to rate our long-term debt rating outlook as Stable since November 2020, while Moodys recently upgraded our long-term debt rating outlook to Positive in December 2021.\nThe current ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:\nNAME OF RATING AGENCY Pfizer Short-Term Rating Pfizer Long-Term Rating Outlook/Watch\nMoodys P-1 A2 Positive\nS&P A-1+ A+ Stable\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCapital Allocation Framework\nOur capital allocation framework is devised to facilitate (i) the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&D investments and business development activities and (ii) returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our Business and Strategy section of this MD&A.\nOur current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizers BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. In December 2021, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on March 4, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 28, 2022. The first-quarter 2022 cash dividend will be our 333rd consecutive quarterly dividend.\nSee Note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 46\nmay arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 16B.\nAdditionally, certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products. Furthermore, collaboration, licensing or other R&D arrangements may give rise to potential milestone payments. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.\nOur significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:\nLong-term debt, including current portion (see Note 7) and related interest payments;\nEstimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation estimated tax liability (see Note 5). Estimated future payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax liability that will occur after December 31, 2021 total $8.3 billion, of which an estimated $750 million is to be paid in the next twelve months and an estimated $7.6 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter;\nCertain commitments totaling $5.2 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months, and $3.7 billion in periods thereafter (see Note 16C);\nPurchases of property plant and equipment (see Note 9). In 2022, we expect to spend approximately $3.3 billion on property, plant and equipment; and\nFuture minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (see Note 15).\nGlobal Economic Conditions\nOur Venezuela and Argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material. For additional information on the global economic environment, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Global Operations section in this Form 10-K.\nMarket Risk\nWe are subject to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address such exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. For more information on how we manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risks, see Notes 1G and 7E, as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section in this Form 10-K for key currencies in which we operate. Our sensitivity analyses of such risks are discussed below.\nForeign Exchange Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currencys rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect on another currencys rates relative to the U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2021, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nInterest Rate Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2021, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nEquity Price Risk--We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. From time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nLIBOR\nFor information on interest rate risk and LIBOR, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Global Operations section in this Form 10-K. We do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 47\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standard\nSee Note 1B.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2021\nStandard/Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements\nReference rate reform provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.\nThe new guidance provides the following optional expedients:\n1.Simplify accounting analyses under current U.S. GAAP for contract modifications.\n2.Simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue.\n3.Allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform.\nElections can be adopted prospectively at any time through December 31, 2022. We are assessing the impact, but currently, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606. This new guidance will generally result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts that were recorded by the acquiree. Previously, these amounts were recognized by the acquirer at fair value as of the acquisition date.\nJanuary 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the discussion in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 48\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nPfizer Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\nAs discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Companys revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Companys estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Companys ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\nEvaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1Q, the Companys tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Companys tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nWe identified the evaluation of the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Companys interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the Companys liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Companys tax positions may not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Companys interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the Companys assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.\nEvaluation of product and other product-related litigation\nAs discussed in Notes 1S and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product and other product-related legal proceedings requires a complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.\nWe identified the evaluation of product and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Companys judgments about future events and uncertainties.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Companys external and internal legal counsel that described the Companys probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings. We inspected the Companys minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters. We evaluated the Companys ability to estimate its monetary exposure to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of prior legal matters. We analyzed relevant publicly available information about the Company, its competitors, and the industry.\nWe have not been able to determine the specific year that we or our predecessor firms began serving as the Companys auditor, however, we are aware that we or our predecessor firms have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1942.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2022\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 50\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues $ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales(a)\n30,821 8,484 8,054\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses(a)\n12,703 11,597 12,726\nResearch and development expenses(a)\n13,829 9,393 8,385\nAmortization of intangible assets 3,700 3,348 4,429\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs\n802 579 601\n(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction - (6) (8,107)\nOther (income)/deductions--net (4,878) 1,219 3,497\nIncome from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income 24,311 7,036 11,321\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income 1,852 370 583\nIncome from continuing operations 22,459 6,666 10,738\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (434) 2,529 5,318\nNet income before allocation to noncontrolling interests 22,025 9,195 16,056\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 45 36 29\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 21,979 $ 9,159 $ 16,026\nEarnings per common share--basic:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 4.00 $ 1.19 $ 1.92\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) 0.46 0.95\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.92 $ 1.65 $ 2.88\nEarnings per common share--diluted:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 3.93 $ 1.18 $ 1.89\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) 0.45 0.94\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.85 $ 1.63 $ 2.82\nWeighted-average shares--basic 5,601 5,555 5,569\nWeighted-average shares--diluted 5,708 5,632 5,675\n(a)Exclusive of amortization of intangible assets, except as disclosed in Note 1M.\nSee Accompanying Notes.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 51\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nNet income before allocation to noncontrolling interests $ 22,025 $ 9,195 $ 16,056\nForeign currency translation adjustments, net (682) 772 675\nReclassification adjustments - (17) (288)\n(682) 755 387\nUnrealized holding gains/(losses) on derivative financial instruments, net 526 (582) 476\nReclassification adjustments for (gains)/losses included in net income(a)\n134 21 (664)\n660 (561) (188)\nUnrealized holding gains/(losses) on available-for-sale securities, net (355) 361 (1)\nReclassification adjustments for (gains)/losses included in net income(b)\n(30) (188) 39\n(384) 173 38\nBenefit plans: prior service (costs)/credits and other, net 116 52 (7)\nReclassification adjustments related to amortization of prior service costs and other, net (154) (176) (181)\nReclassification adjustments related to curtailments of prior service costs and other, net (74) - (2)\nOther (2) - 1\n(113) (124) (189)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss), before tax (519) 243 48\nTax provision/(benefit) on other comprehensive income/(loss) 71 (227) 178\nOther comprehensive income/(loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests $ (589) $ 471 $ (130)\nComprehensive income/(loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests $ 21,435 $ 9,666 $ 15,926\nLess: Comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 43 27 18\nComprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. $ 21,393 $ 9,639 $ 15,908\n(a)Reclassified into Other (income)/deductions-net and Cost of sales.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nA. Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The decision of whether or not to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.\nAt the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. See Note 17. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed within the Hospital therapeutic area. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) pursuant to an agreement dated November 13, 2020, and we transferred related inventories and operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities associated with Meridian and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2020. Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on November 16, 2020, the Upjohn assets and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in Retained Earnings-Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity. Prior to the spin-off of the Upjohn Business in November 2020, the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating segment. With the separation of the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian, as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2021, 2020 and 2019 impacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2.\nCertain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.\nB. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted a new accounting standard for income tax that eliminates certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nC. Change in Accounting Principle\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we adopted a change in accounting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans (MTM Accounting). Under the prior policy, we deferred recognition of these gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The accumulated actuarial gains/losses outside of a corridor were then amortized into net periodic benefit costs over the average remaining service period or the average life expectancy of participants. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented, and as of January 1, 2019, resulted in a cumulative effect decrease to Retained earnings of $6.0 billion, with a corresponding offset to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss is recognized immediately and classified as Other (income)/deductions--net.\nWe believe that MTM Accounting is a more preferable policy as it provides improved transparency of results and performance, better alignment with fair value accounting principles and a better reflection of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions and the actuarial impact of plan remeasurements.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe impacts of the adjustments on our consolidated financial statements are summarized as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Income:\n(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction $ - $ - $ - $ (6) $ - $ (6) $ (8,086) $ (21) $ (8,107)\nOther (income)/deductions--net (2,820) (2,058) (4,878) 672 547 1,219 3,264 233 3,497\nIncome from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income 22,253 2,058 24,311 7,584 (547) 7,036 11,533 (212) 11,321\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income 1,399 453 1,852 496 (125) 370 631 (48) 583\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (434) - (434) 2,564 (35) 2,529 5,400 (82) 5,318\nNet income before allocation to noncontrolling interests 20,420 1,605 22,025 9,652 (457) 9,195 16,302 (246) 16,056\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 20,374 1,605 21,979 9,616 (457) 9,159 16,273 (246) 16,026\nEarnings per common share--basic:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.71 $ 0.29 $ 4.00 $ 1.27 $ (0.08) $ 1.19 $ 1.95 $ (0.03) $ 1.92\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) - (0.08) 0.46 (0.01) 0.46 0.97 (0.01) 0.95\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 3.63 0.29 3.92 1.73 (0.08) 1.65 2.92 (0.04) 2.88\nEarnings per common share--diluted:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.65 $ 0.28 $ 3.93 $ 1.25 $ (0.07) $ 1.18 $ 1.92 $ (0.03) $ 1.89\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) - (0.08) 0.46 (0.01) 0.45 0.95 (0.01) 0.94\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 3.57 0.28 3.85 1.71 (0.08) 1.63 2.87 (0.04) 2.82\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(MILLIONS) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:\nForeign currency translation adjustments, net $ (731) $ 49 $ (682) $ 957 $ (185) $ 772 $ 654 $ 21 $ 675\nBenefit plans: actuarial gains/(losses), net 1,565 (1,565) - (1,128) 1,128 - (826) 826 -\nReclassification adjustments related to amortization 285 (285) - 276 (276) - 241 (241) -\nReclassification adjustments related to settlements, net 209 (209) - 278 (278) - 274 (274) -\nOther 49 (49) - (189) 189 - 22 (22) -\nTax provision/(benefit) on other comprehensive income/(loss) 545 (475) 71 (349) 122 (227) 115 63 178\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nDeferred taxes from continuing operations $ (4,746) $ 453 $ (4,293) $ (1,449) $ (125) $ (1,575) $ 609 $ (48) $ 561\nBenefit plan contributions in excess of expense/income (1,065) (2,058) (3,123) (1,790) 547 (1,242) (288) 233 (55)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\n(MILLIONS) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Balance Sheets:\nNoncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets $ 3,320 $ 22 $ 3,341 $ 2,383 $ - $ 2,383\nOther noncurrent assets 7,679 - 7,679 4,879 - 4,879\nPension benefit obligations 3,489 - 3,489 4,766 - 4,766\nRetained earnings 101,789 1,605 103,394 96,770 (6,378) 90,392\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (4,313) (1,583) (5,897) (11,688) 6,378 (5,310)\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nD. Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.\nOur estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change.\nE. Acquisitions\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed in Research and development expenses.\nContingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair value is generally estimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in Other (income)/deductions--net.\nF. Fair Value\nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and after the transfer.\nWhen estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:\nIncome approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.\nMarket approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nCost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.\nOur fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:\nQuoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).\nUnobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).\nThe following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yield curves.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values-quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.\nDerivative assets and liabilities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models use market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.\nMoney market funds-observable NAV prices.\nWe periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial instruments.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nG. Foreign Currency Translation\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\nH. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\nRevenue Recognition--We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.\nOur Sales Contracts--Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.\nDeductions from Revenues--Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns--Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\nCustomers--Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\nSpecifically:\nIn the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective periods sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare coverage gap, also known as the doughnut hole, based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.\nOutside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the governments total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\nProvisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven products in 2020 and for each of six products in 2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of our revenues in 2019. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nOur accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nReserve against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts\n$ 1,077 $ 861\nOther current liabilities:\nAccrued rebates 3,811 3,017\nOther accruals 528 432\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n433 399\nTotal accrued rebates and other sales-related accruals $ 5,850 $ 4,708\nTaxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Revenues.\nTrade Accounts Receivable-Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.\nIn determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nI. Collaborative Arrangements\nPayments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration partners as Cost of sales. Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nReimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses. Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as Research and development expenses. Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in Identifiable intangible assets-Developed technology rights. Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net over the development period for the products, when our performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone payments earned by us may be recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.\nJ. Cost of Sales and Inventories\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.\nK. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $2.3 billion in 2019. Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of TV, radio, and other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nL. Research and Development Expenses\nR&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.\nM. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include:\nProperty, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation-These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.\nIdentifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization-These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.\nGoodwill-Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.\nAmortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that are for a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.\nSpecifically:\nFor finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.\nFor goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the implied fair value.\nN. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.\nIn connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and\nIn connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.\nIncluded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\nOur business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).\nO. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows\nCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 62\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nCash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrument. Cash flows for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.\nP. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Our investments are primarily comprised of the following:\nPublic equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.\nPrivate equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nFor equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investees income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions-net. The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee, with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include contingent consideration.\nRealized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.\nWe regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\nDerivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see Note 7A), with changes in fair value reported in Net income or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E).\nQ. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies\nTax Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent tax assets primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to future tax obligations.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.\nOther non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.\nOther taxes payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see Note 5D for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\nWe account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 63\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nArrays portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing agreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in development--indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology--finite-lived licensing agreements with a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of approximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in Discontinued operations--net of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship after the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among other activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period. No amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was renamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received approximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are generally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an independent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and \u20ac3.60 billion aggregate principal amounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan agreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued operations--net of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and reflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn Business, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net credits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operations--net of tax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment banking fees.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 65\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nIn connection with the Transactions, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and Combination to provide a framework for our relationship after the Combination, including a separation and distribution agreement, interim operating models, including agency arrangements, MSAs, TSAs, a tax matters agreement, and an employee matters agreement, among others. The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from four to seven years post-Separation. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance, information technology and human resource infrastructure and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than three years post-Separation. The amounts recorded under the above agreements were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2021 and 2020. In addition, Pfizer and Mylan had a pre-existing arms-length commercial agreement, which is continuing with Viatris and is not material to Pfizers consolidated financial statements.\nNet amounts due from Viatris under the above agreements were $53 million as of December 31, 2021 and $401 million as of December 31, 2020. The cash flows associated with the above agreements are included in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for a $277 million payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms of the separation agreement, which is reported in Other financing activities, net, and was recorded as a payable to Viatris in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nComponents of Discontinued operations--net of tax:\nYear Ended December 31,(a)\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues $ 277 $ 7,572 $ 10,845\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales 204 2,106 2,173\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 26 1,682 1,624\nResearch and development expenses 9 224 265\nAmortization of intangible assets 45 224 181\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs 2 29 146\nOther (income)/deductions--net 365 428 401\nPre-tax income/(loss) from discontinued operations (375) 2,879 6,056\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income (107) 349 738\nIncome/(loss) from discontinued operations--net of tax (268) 2,529 5,318\nPre-tax loss on sale of discontinued operations (211) - -\nBenefit for taxes on income (44) - -\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations--net of tax (167) - -\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax $ (434) $ 2,529 $ 5,318\n(a)In 2021, Discontinued operations-net of tax primarily includes (i) the operations of Meridian prior to its sale on December 31, 2021 recognized in Income/(loss) from discontinued operations-net of tax, which includes a pre-tax amount for a Multi-District Litigation relating to EpiPen against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas for $345 million; and (ii) the after tax loss of $167 million related to the sale of Meridian recognized in Loss on sale of discontinued operations--net of tax. To a much lesser extent, Discontinued operations-net of tax in 2021 also includes the operations of the Mylan-Japan collaboration prior to its termination on December 21, 2020 and post-closing adjustments directly related to our former Upjohn and Nutrition discontinued businesses, including adjustments for tax, benefits and legal-related matters recognized in Income/(loss) from discontinued operations-net of tax. In 2020 and 2019, Discontinued operations-net of tax relates to the operations of the Upjohn Business, Meridian and the Mylan-Japan collaboration and includes the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. In 2020, Discontinued operations-net of tax includes pre-tax interest expense of $116 million associated with the U.S. dollar and Euro denominated senior unsecured notes issued by Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. in the second quarter of 2020 and pre-tax charges of $223 million related to the remeasurement of Euro debt issued by Upjohn Finance B.V. in the second quarter of 2020.\nComponents of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale:\nAs of December 31,(a)\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale--Other current assets\n$ 25 $ 215\nProperty, plant and equipment $ - $ 155\nIdentifiable intangible assets - 134\nOther noncurrent assets - 29\nNoncurrent assets of discontinued operations--Other noncurrent assets\n$ - $ 319\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations--Other current liabilities\n$ - $ 74\nNoncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations--Other noncurrent liabilities\n$ - $ 16\n(a)Amounts as of December 31, 2021 represent property, plant and equipment held for sale.

Equity-Method Investments\nFormation of Consumer Healthcare JV\nOn July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. Upon closing, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financial results and our Consumer Healthcare segments operating results for 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. The financial results for 2021 and 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business.\nIn valuing our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV, we used discounted cash flow techniques. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal or regulatory forces on the products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long term; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect our best estimate of the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nWe are accounting for our interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment. The carrying value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV is $16.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is reported as a private equity investment in Equity-method investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The decrease in the value of our investment from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to dividends totaling $499 million, as well as $384 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6), partially offset by our share of the JVs earnings. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net commencing from August 1, 2019. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, which we recorded in our operating results in 2021, was $495 million. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020, which we recorded in our operating results in 2020, was $417 million. Our total share of two months of the JVs earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019, which we recorded in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019, was $47 million. As of the July 31, 2019 closing date, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV was $15.7 billion and that 32% of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was $11.2 billion, resulting in an initial basis difference of approximately $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily completed the allocation of the basis difference, which resulted from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV, primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities and equity method goodwill within the investment account. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Consumer Healthcare JV revised the initial carrying value of the net assets of the JV and our 32% share of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was reduced to $11.0 billion and our initial basis difference was increased to $4.8 billion. The adjustment was allocated to equity method goodwill within the investment account. We began recording the amortization of basis differences allocated to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities in Other (income)/deductions--net commencing August 1, 2019. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV is included in Other (income)/deductions--net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented. See Note 4. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years.\nAs a part of Pfizer in 2019, pre-tax income on a management basis for the Consumer Healthcare business was $654 million through July 31, 2019.\nSummarized financial information for our equity method investee, the Consumer Healthcare JV, as of September 30, 2021, the most recent period available, and as of September 30, 2020 and for the periods ending September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n(MILLIONS) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nCurrent assets $ 6,890 $ 6,614\nNoncurrent assets 39,445 38,361\nTotal assets\n$ 46,335 $ 44,975\nCurrent liabilities $ 5,133 $ 5,246\nNoncurrent liabilities 5,218 5,330\nTotal liabilities\n$ 10,351 $ 10,576\nEquity attributable to shareholders $ 35,705 $ 34,154\nEquity attributable to noncontrolling interests 279 245\nTotal net equity $ 35,984 $ 34,400\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nFor the Twelve Months Ending For the Two Months Ending\n(MILLIONS) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019\nNet sales $ 12,836 $ 12,720 $ 2,161\nCost of sales (4,755) (5,439) (803)\nGross profit $ 8,081 $ 7,281 $ 1,358\nIncome from continuing operations 1,614 1,350 152\nNet income 1,614 1,350 152\nIncome attributable to shareholders 1,547 1,307 148\nInvestment in ViiV\nIn 2009, we and GSK created ViiV, which is focused on research, development and commercialization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines. We own approximately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investment under the equity method due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investment was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cumulative equity method losses and dividends. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from ViiV as income in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $166 million in 2021, $278 million in 2020 and $220 million in 2019 (see Note 4).\nSummarized financial information for our equity method investee, ViiV, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nCurrent assets $ 3,608 $ 3,283\nNoncurrent assets 3,563 3,381\nTotal assets\n$ 7,171 $ 6,664\nCurrent liabilities $ 3,497 $ 3,028\nNoncurrent liabilities 6,536 6,370\nTotal liabilities\n$ 10,033 $ 9,398\nTotal net equity/(deficit) attributable to shareholders $ (2,862) $ (2,734)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nNet sales $ 6,380 $ 6,224 $ 6,139\nCost of sales (682) (574) (516)\nGross profit $ 5,698 $ 5,650 $ 5,623\nIncome from continuing operations 2,040 2,012 3,398\nNet income 2,040 2,012 3,398\nIncome attributable to shareholders 2,040 2,012 3,398\nD. Licensing Arrangements\nAgreement with Valneva\nOn April 30, 2020, we signed an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valnevas Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which covers six serotypes that are prevalent in North America and Europe. Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of up to $308 million in cash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development program, and in return we will pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.\nAgreement with Akcea\nOn October 4, 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ionis. The transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront payment of $250 million to Akcea, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2019. On January 31, 2022, we and Ionis announced the discontinuation of the Pfizer-led clinical development program for the licensed product and that we would be returning the rights to the licensed product to Ionis.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nE. Collaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity. Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.\nCollaboration with Beam\nOn December 24, 2021, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beams in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. Under the terms of the agreement, Beam conducts all research activities through development candidate selection for three undisclosed targets, which are not included in Beams existing programs, and we may opt in to obtain exclusive licenses to each development candidate. Beam has a right to opt in, at the end of phase 1/2 studies, upon the payment by Beam of an option exercise fee, to a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration pursuant to which we and Beam would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a 65%/35% ratio (Pfizer/Beam). Upon entering into the agreement, we recorded $300 million in Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an upfront payment due to Beam, and if we exercise our opt in to licenses for all three targets, Beam would be eligible for up to an additional $1.05 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for a potential total deal consideration of up to $1.35 billion. Beam is also eligible to receive royalties on global net sales for each licensed program.\nCollaboration with Arvinas\nOn July 21, 2021, we entered into a global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC\u00ae (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader. The estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers. In connection with the agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $650 million to Arvinas and we made a $350 million equity investment in the common stock of Arvinas. We recognized $706 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on our equity investment in Research and development expenses in our third quarter of 2021. Arvinas is also eligible to receive up to $400 million in approval milestones and up to $1 billion in commercial milestones. The companies will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses and profits. As of December 31, 2021, we held a 6.5% equity stake of Arvinas.\nCollaboration with Myovant\nOn December 26, 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Myovant to jointly develop and commercialize Orgovyx (relugolix) in advanced prostate cancer and Myfembree (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in womens health in the U.S. and Canada. We also received an exclusive option to commercialize relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries, which we declined to exercise. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses for Orgovyx and Myfembree in the U.S. and Canada, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in 2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. We record our share of gross profits as Alliance revenue. Myovant remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead clinical development for Myfembree. Myovant is entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion, including an upfront payment of $650 million, which was made in December 2020, $200 million in potential regulatory milestones for FDA approvals for Myfembree in womens health, of which $100 million was paid to Myovant in July 2021 and recognized as Identifiable intangible assets-Developed technology rights, and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion in total for prostate cancer and for the combined womens health indications. In connection with this transaction, in 2020 we recognized $499 million in Identifiable intangible assets--Developed technology rights and $151 million in Research and development expenses representing the relative fair value of the portion of the upfront payment allocated to the approved indication and unapproved indications of the product, respectively.\nCollaboration with CStone\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration with CStone to address oncological needs in China. The collaboration encompasses our $200 million upfront equity investment in CStone, the development and commercialization of CStones sugemalimab (CS1001, PD-L1 antibody) in mainland China, and a framework between the companies to bring additional oncology assets to the Greater China market. The transaction closed on October 9, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we held a 9.8% equity stake of CStone.\nCollaborations with BioNTech\nOn December 30, 2021, we entered into a new research, development and commercialization agreement to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster virus) based on BioNTechs proprietary mRNA technology and our antigen technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech $225 million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to BioNTech was recorded to Research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech will share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of any product.\nOn April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162b2, aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. In connection with the April 2020 agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment in the common stock of BioNTech of $113 million. We recognized $98 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on the equity investment in Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and BioNTech share gross profits and development costs equally after approval and successful commercialization of the vaccine, and we were responsible for all of\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nthe development costs until commercialization of the vaccine. Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of these development costs through reductions in gross profit sharing and milestone payments to BioNTech over time. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021 agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50 percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D costs are being shared equally. We have commercialization rights to the vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We recognize Revenues and Cost of sales on a gross basis in markets where we are commercializing the vaccine and we record our share of gross profits related to sales of the vaccine by BioNTech in Germany and Turkey in Alliance revenues.\nWe made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we held an equity stake of 2.5% of BioNTech.\nSummarized Financial Information for Collaborative Arrangements\nThe following provides the amounts and classification of payments (income/(expense)) between us and our collaboration partners:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues-Revenues(a)\n$ 590 $ 284 $ 305\nRevenues-Alliance revenues(b)\n7,652 5,418 4,648\nTotal revenues from collaborative arrangements $ 8,241 $ 5,703 $ 4,953\nCost of sales(c)\n$ (16,169) $ (61) $ (52)\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses(d)\n(175) (194) (176)\nResearch and development expenses(e)\n(742) (192) 104\nOther income/(deductions)-net(f)\n820 567 362\n(a)Represents sales to our partners of products manufactured by us.\n(b)Substantially all relates to amounts earned from our partners under co-promotion agreements.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nIn 2019, we substantially completed several multi-year initiatives focused on positioning us for future growth and creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business.\nA. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program\nWith the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. This program is primarily composed of the following three initiatives:\nWe are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. We expect costs, primarily related to restructuring our corporate enabling functions, to total $1.6 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs will primarily include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.\nIn addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We expect costs of $1.1 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The costs for this effort primarily include severance and associated implementation costs.\nWe are also optimizing our manufacturing network under this program and incurring one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. We expect to incur costs of $800 million, with approximately 25% of the costs to be non-cash. The costs for this effort include, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.\nThe program costs discussed above are expected to be incurred primarily from 2020 through 2022, and may be rounded and represent approximations.\nFrom the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2021, we incurred costs of $2.2 billion, of which $856 million is associated with Biopharma ($712 million in 2021, $79 million in 2020 and $64 million in 2019).\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 70\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nB. Key Activities\nIn 2021 and 2020, we incurred costs of $1.3 billion and $838 million, respectively, composed primarily of the Transforming to a More Focused Company program. In 2019, we incurred costs of $820 million composed of $548 million for the 2017-2019 and Organizing for Growth initiatives, $288 million for the integration of Array, $94 million for the integration of Hospira, and $87 million for the Transforming to a More Focused Company program, partially offset by income of $197 million, primarily due to the reversal of certain accruals upon the effective favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years and other acquisition-related initiatives.\nThe following summarizes acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives costs and credits:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRestructuring charges/(credits):\nEmployee terminations $ 680 $ 474 $ 108\nAsset impairments 53 66 69\nExit costs/(credits) 8 (6) 50\nRestructuring charges/(credits)(a)\n741 535 227\nTransaction costs(b)\n20 10 63\nIntegration costs and other(c)\n41 34 311\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs\n802 579 601\nNet periodic benefit costs/(credits) recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net(d)\n(63) 3 23\nAdditional depreciation--asset restructuring recorded in our consolidated statements of income as follows(e):\nCost of sales 63 21 29\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 23 - 3\nResearch and development expenses - (3) 8\nTotal additional depreciation--asset restructuring\n87 17 40\nImplementation costs recorded in our consolidated statements of income as follows(f):\nCost of sales 45 40 61\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 426 197 73\nResearch and development expenses 1 1 22\nTotal implementation costs\n472 238 156\nTotal costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives $ 1,298 $ 838 $ 820\n(a)Represents acquisition-related costs ($9 million credit in 2021 and $192 million credit in 2019) and cost reduction initiatives ($750 million charge in 2021, $535 million charge in 2020, and $418 million charge in 2019). 2021 and 2020 charges mainly represent employee termination costs for our Transforming to a More Focused Company cost-reduction program. 2019 restructuring charges mainly represent employee termination costs for cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the reversal of certain accruals related to our acquisition of Wyeth upon the effective favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years (see Note 5B). The employee termination costs for 2019 were primarily for our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our business structure, and also included employee termination costs for the Transforming to a More Focused Company cost-reduction program.\n(b)Represents external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.\n(c)Represents external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, and certain other qualifying costs. 2021 costs primarily related to our acquisition of Trillium. 2020 costs primarily related to our acquisition of Array. 2019 costs mainly related to our acquisitions of Array, including $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options that was recognized as post-closing compensation expense (see Note 2A), and Hospira.\n(d)Amounts include the impact of a change in accounting principle.

Tax Matters\nA. Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations\nComponents of Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income include:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 6,064 $ (2,887) $ 7,332\nInternational 18,247 9,924 3,988\nIncome from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income(a), (b)\n$ 24,311 $ 7,036 $ 11,321\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 72\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n(a)2021 v. 2020--The domestic income in 2021 versus domestic loss in 2020 was mainly related to Comirnaty income, lower asset impairment charges, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and higher net gains from equity securities, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to Comirnaty income, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and lower asset impairment charges.\n(b)2020 v. 2019--The domestic loss in 2020 versus domestic income in 2019 was mainly related to the non-recurrence of the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction as well as higher asset impairment charges and higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to the non-recurrence of the write off of assets contributed to the Consumer Healthcare JV as well as lower asset impairment charges and lower amortization of intangible assets.\nComponents of Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income based on the location of the taxing authorities include:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal\n$ 3,342 $ 372 $ (1,887)\nState and local\n34 56 (186)\nDeferred income taxes:\nFederal\n(3,850) (1,164) 1,254\nState and local\n(491) (131) 276\nTotal U.S. tax benefit\n(964) (867) (543)\nTCJA\nCurrent income taxes\n- - (135)\nDeferred Income taxes\n- - (187)\nTotal TCJA tax benefit\n- - (323)\nInternational\nCurrent income taxes\n2,769 1,517 2,418\nDeferred income taxes\n48 (279) (969)\nTotal international tax provision\n2,816 1,237 1,449\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income\n$ 1,852 $ 370 $ 583\nAmounts discussed below are rounded to the nearest hundred million and represent approximations.\nWe elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The third annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 15, 2021 due date. The fourth annual installment is due April 18, 2022 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of December 31, 2021. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.\nThe changes in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below:\n2021 v. 2020\nThe higher effective tax rate in 2021 was mainly the result of:\nthe change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings primarily related to Comirnaty; and\nlower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,\npartially offset by:\ncertain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe higher effective tax rate in 2020 was mainly the result of:\nthe non-recurrence of the $1.4 billion tax benefits, representing taxes and interest, recorded in 2019 due to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years;\nthe non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our then new business structure; and\nthe non-recurrence of the tax benefits recorded in 2019 as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the TCJA, as well as:\nlower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,\npartially offset by:\nthe non-recurrence of the tax expense of $2.7 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2019 associated with the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction; and\nthe favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nIn all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Note 2A).\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 73\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nB. Tax Rate Reconciliation\nThe reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for Income from continuing operations follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nU.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nTCJA impact(a)\n- - (2.9)\nTaxation of non-U.S. operations (b), (c)\n(4.3) (9.9) (4.7)\nTax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions(a)\n(0.4) (2.7) (14.0)\nCompletion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction(a)\n- - 8.3\nCertain Consumer Healthcare JV initiatives(a)\n(6.0) - -\nU.S. R&D tax credit (0.5) (1.4) (0.8)\nInterest(d)\n0.4 1.1 0.6\nAll other, net(e)\n(2.6) (2.8) (2.3)\nEffective tax rate for income from continuing operations\n7.6 % 5.3 % 5.2 %\n(a)See Note 5A.\n(b)For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions, as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre-tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the location of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.\n(c)In all years, the reduction in our effective tax rate is a result of the jurisdictional location of earnings and is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for our subsidiaries in Singapore and, to a lesser extent, in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican tax incentives pursuant to a grant that expires during 2029. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes.

See Note 1Q.\n(a)The increase in net deferred tax assets in 2021 is primarily related to temporary differences associated with Comirnaty royalty accruals and the result of operating lease ROU liabilities recognized during the period.\n(b)The increase in the deferred tax assets is primarily due to the acquisition of intangible assets relating to Trillium and the decrease in the 2021 deferred tax liabilities is primarily the result of amortization of intangible assets.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n(c)The increase in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily the result of operating lease ROU assets recognized during the period. See Note 15.\n(d)The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2021 is primarily the result of favorable pension plan asset performance reported in the period. See Note 11A.\n(e)The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax credit carryforwards that are available, under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.\n(f)The decrease in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily due to certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n(g)In 2021, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.6 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($0.3 billion). In 2020, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($0.9 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($4.1 billion).\nWe have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2022 to 2041. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $55.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2021 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in the normal course of business based on operational cash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings and profits analysis for such events.\nD. Tax Contingencies\nFor a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see Note 1Q.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.5 billion and as of December 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.\nTax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.4 billion) and Other taxes payable ($105 million). As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.1 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($122 million) and Other taxes payable ($46 million).\nSubstantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.\nThe reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nBalance, beginning $ (5,595) $ (5,381) $ (6,259)\nAcquisitions - 37 (44)\nDivestitures(a)\n- 265 -\nIncreases based on tax positions taken during a prior period(b)\n(111) (232) (36)\nDecreases based on tax positions taken during a prior period(b), (c)\n103 64 1,109\nDecreases based on settlements for a prior period(d)\n24 15 100\nIncreases based on tax positions taken during the current period(b)\n(550) (411) (383)\nImpact of foreign exchange 22 (72) 25\nOther, net(b), (e)\n40 120 107\nBalance, ending(f)\n$ (6,068) $ (5,595) $ (5,381)\n(a)For 2020, related to the separation of Upjohn. See Note 2B.\n(b)Primarily included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.\n(c)Primarily related to effectively settling certain issues with the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. See Note 5A.\n(d)Primarily related to cash payments and reductions of tax attributes.\n(e)Primarily related to decreases as a result of a lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.\n(f)In 2021, included in Income taxes payable ($19 million), Other current assets ($42 million) Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($3.0 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($5 million) and Other taxes payable ($3.0 billion). In 2020, included in Income taxes payable ($34 million), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($18 million), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($3.0 billion) and Other taxes payable ($2.5 billion).\nInterest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded net increases in interest of $108 million and $89 million, respectively. In 2019, we recorded a net decrease in interest of $564 million, resulting primarily from a settlement with the IRS. Gross accrued interest totaled $601 million as of December 31, 2021 (reflecting a decrease of $1 million as a result of cash payments) and gross\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 75\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\naccrued interest totaled $493 million as of December 31, 2020 (reflecting a decrease of $5 million as a result of cash payments and a decrease of $75 million relating to the separation of Upjohn). In 2021 and 2020, these amounts were substantially all included in Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A.\nStatus of Tax Audits and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions\nThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, the IRS has issued Revenue Agents Reports (RARs) for tax years 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. We are not in agreement with the RARs and are currently appealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2016-2018 are currently under audit. Tax years 2019-2021 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years in certain major international tax jurisdictions such as Canada (2013-2021), Europe (2011-2021, primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2011-2021, primarily reflecting China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2021, primarily reflecting Brazil).\nAny settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $75 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.\nE.

We recorded a net loss of $138 million in Other (income)/deductions--net, which included the related termination of cross currency swaps.\nE. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nForeign Exchange Risk\nA significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.\nThe derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.\nWe hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound and Australian dollar for up to two years.\nUnder certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.\nChanges in fair value are reported in earnings or in Other comprehensive income/(loss), depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the excluded amount through an amortization approach in earnings. The hedge relationships are as follows:\nGenerally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of the hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the hedged item in earnings.\nGenerally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nWe record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) --Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.\nFor foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts take the opposite currency position of that reflected on the balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.\nWe recognize the change in fair value on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings, as well as the offsetting earnings impact of the hedged risk attributable to the hedged item.\nThe following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts (including those reported as part of discontinued operations):\n(MILLIONS) As of December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2020\nFair Value Fair Value\nNotional Asset Liability Notional Asset Liability\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts(a)\n$ 29,576 $ 787 $ 717 $ 24,369 $ 145 $ 1,005\nInterest rate contracts\n2,250 21 - 1,950 135 -\n808 717 280 1,005\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 21,419 160 164 $ 15,063 94 95\nTotal $ 968 $ 881 $ 373 $ 1,100\n(a)The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts hedging our intercompany forecasted inventory sales was $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 80\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe following summarizes information about the gains/(losses) incurred to hedge or offset operational foreign exchange or interest rate risk exposures (including those reported as part of discontinued operations):\nGains/(Losses)\nRecognized in OID(a)\nGains/(Losses)\nRecognized in OCI(a)\nGains/(Losses)\nReclassified from\nOCI into OID and COS(a)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Cash Flow Hedge Relationships:\nForeign exchange contracts(b)\n$ - $ - $ 488 $ (649) $ (173) $ (77)\nAmount excluded from effectiveness testing and amortized into earnings(c)\n- - 38 55 38 57\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Fair Value Hedge Relationships:\nInterest rate contracts\n(7) 369 - - - -\nHedged item\n7 (369) - - - -\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Net Investment Hedge Relationships:\nForeign exchange contracts - - 468 (501) - -\nAmount excluded from effectiveness testing and amortized into earnings(c)\n- - 52 181 109 154\nNon-Derivative Financial Instruments in Net Investment Hedge Relationships:(d)\nForeign currency short-term borrowings - - 78 8 - -\nForeign currency long-term debt - - 86 (183) - -\nDerivative Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts (192) 178 - - - -\nAll other net(c)\n- - 1 12 1 (1)\n$ (192) $ 178 $ 1,210 $ (1,077) $ (25) $ 133\n(a)OID = Other (income)/deductions-net, included in Other (income)/deductions-net in the consolidated statements of income.

Based on year-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax gain of $362 million within the next 12 months into income. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future foreign exchange cash flows is approximately 21 years and relates to foreign currency debt.\n(c)The amounts reclassified from OCI were reclassified into OID.\n(d)Short-term borrowings and long-term debt include foreign currency borrowings which are used as net investment hedges. The short-term borrowings carrying value as of December 31, 2021 was $1.1 billion.

Credit Risk\nOn an ongoing basis, we monitor and review the credit risk of our customers, financial institutions and exposures in our investment portfolio.\nWith respect to our trade accounts receivable, we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit in the normal course of business. In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable and\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 81\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nallowance for credit losses, see Note 1H. A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 17C.\nWith respect to our investments, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with government, government agency, and corporate issuers of securities. Investments are placed in instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio represent primarily sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Canada, Japan, U.K., Germany, France, Australia, and Switzerland.\nWith respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $372 million, for which we have posted collateral of $382 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $477 million, for which we have received collateral of $581 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.\nNote 8.

We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\nBrands\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\nIPR&D\nIPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\nIPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\nLicensing Agreements\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 83\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAmortization\nThe weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 8 years, and for the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 7 years. Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $3.7 billion in 2021, $3.4 billion in 2020 and $4.5 billion in 2019.\nThe following provides the expected annual amortization expense:\n(MILLIONS) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\nAmortization expense $ 3,279 $ 2,936 $ 2,686 $ 2,500 $ 2,449\nB. Goodwill\nThe following summarizes the components and changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill:\n(MILLIONS) Total(a)\nBalance, January 1, 2020\n$ 48,181\nAdditions(b)\nOther(c)\nBalance, December 31, 2020\n49,556\nAdditions -\nOther(c)\n(348)\nBalance, December 31, 2021\n$ 49,208\n(a)As a result of the reorganization of our commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 17), we were required to estimate the relative fair values of our PC1 and Hospital organizations to determine any reallocation of goodwill. We completed this analysis and determined that no goodwill was required to be reallocated. As a result, our entire goodwill balance continues to be assigned within the Biopharma reportable segment.\n(b)Additions primarily represent the impact of measurement period adjustments related to our Array acquisition (see Note 2A).\n(c)Other represents the impact of foreign exchange.\nNote 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.\nAs discussed in Note 1C, we adopted a change in accounting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of pension and postretirement plans. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented.\nA. Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs and Changes in Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nThe following summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit), including those reported as part of discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019, and the changes in Other comprehensive income/(loss) for our benefit plans:\nPension Plans Postretirement Plans\nU.S. International\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nService cost $ - $ - $ - $ 130 $ 146 $ 125 $ 36 $ 38 $ 37\nInterest cost 455 533 676 146 164 215 29 49 75\nExpected return on plan assets\n(1,052) (1,015) (890) (327) (314) (318) (39) (36) (33)\nAmortization of prior service cost/(credit) (2) (3) (4) (1) (3) (4) (151) (170) (173)\nActuarial (gains)/losses(a)\n(684) 1,152 284 (690) 148 669 (167) (165) (118)\nCurtailments - - (4) (4) - (1) (82) - (62)\nSpecial termination benefits\n17 1 20 - - - 2 - 2\nNet periodic benefit cost/(credit) reported in income (1,265) 668 82 (746) 141 686 (372) (282) (271)\nCost/(credit) reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n2 5 4 4 5 21 107 114 164\nCost/(credit) recognized in Comprehensive income\n$ (1,264) $ 674 $ 86 $ (742) $ 145 $ 707 $ (265) $ (168) $ (107)\n(a)Reflects actuarial remeasurement gains in 2021, primarily due to favorable plan asset performance and increases in discount rates, and actuarial remeasurement losses in 2020 and 2019, primarily due to decreases in discount rates partially offset by favorable plan asset performance.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 84\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit) other than the service cost component are included in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4).\nB.

We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\nThe weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2021 resulted in higher discount rates as compared to the prior year.\nThe following provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2020\nHealthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.0 % 5.6 %\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline 4.0 % 4.5 %\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2045 2037\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 85\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nC.

Level 2 investments may include short-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.\nEquity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted, suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.\nFixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2 investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.\nOther investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments. Level 3 investments may include securities or insurance contracts that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.\nEquity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments as appropriate for lagged reporting of up to three months.\nCertain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.\nGlobal plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage net periodic benefit costs and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans invested assets. Our long-term return expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification, active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change, we may adjust our targets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.\nE. Cash Flows\nIt is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax laws.\nThe following provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:\nPension Plans Postretirement Plans\n(MILLIONS) U.S. International\nExpected employer contributions:\n2022 $ 138 $ 177 $ 74\nExpected benefit payments:\n2022 $ 1,296 $ 384 $ 78\n2023 1,155 372 73\n2024 1,140 383 69\n2025 1,089 392 66\n2026 1,058 397 68\n2027-2031 4,908 2,124 359\nThe above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of the benefit obligation.\nF. Defined Contribution Plans\nWe have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other countries. For the majority of the U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of their salaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of the employee contributions. We also offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) which is an annual non-contributory employer contribution in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of $732 million in 2021, $685 million in 2020 and $659 million in 2019.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 88\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nNote 12. Equity\nA. Common Stock Purchases\nWe purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2017, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2019. In December 2018, the BOD authorized another $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn February 2019, we entered into an ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to repurchase $6.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. We paid $6.8 billion and received an initial delivery of 130 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. In August 2019, the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC was completed resulting in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC owing us an additional 33.5 million shares of our common stock. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the ASR was $41.42 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock.\nThe following provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share purchase plans, including our ASR:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(SHARES IN MILLIONS, DOLLARS IN BILLIONS) 2021\n2019(a)\nShares of common stock purchased - - 213\nCost of purchase $ - $ - $ 8.9\n(a)Represents shares purchased pursuant to the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC entered into in February 2019, as well as open market share repurchases of $2.1 billion.\nOur remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021.\nB. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans\nPrior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock, into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate of elimination and a restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.\nSince May 4, 2020, we have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2021, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million in 2021, $19 million in 2020 and $20 million in 2019.\nNote 13. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and Stock Options, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nThe 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized for grants. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 315 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 89\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nA summary of the awards and valuation details:\nAwarded to Terms Valuation Recognition and Presentation\nTotal Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs)(a), (b)\nSenior and other key management and select employees Entitle the holder to receive shares of our common stock with a value equal to the difference between the defined settlement price and the grant price, plus the dividend equivalents accumulated during the five or seven-year term, if and to the extent the total value is positive.\nSettlement price is the average closing price of our common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant, as applicable;

See Note 12.\nNote 15. Leases\nWe lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $381 million in 2021, $380 million in 2020 and $326 million in 2019. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.\nFor operating leases, the ROU assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) Balance Sheet Classification 2021 2020\nROU assets Other noncurrent assets $ 2,839 $ 1,386\nLease liabilities (short-term) Other current liabilities 449 320\nLease liabilities (long-term) Other noncurrent liabilities 2,510 1,108\nComponents of total lease cost includes:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nOperating lease cost $ 548 $ 432 $ 421\nVariable lease cost 381 380 326\nSublease income (41) (40) (45)\nTotal lease cost $ 888 $ 772 $ 702\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 93\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nOther supplemental information follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nOperating leases\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Lease Term (Years) 12 6.9\nWeighted-Average Discount Rate 2.8 % 2.9 %\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 387 $ 333 $ 338\n(Gains)/losses on sale and leaseback transactions, net 1 (3) (29)\nThe following reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for the first five years and total of the remaining years to the operating lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021:\n(MILLIONS)\nPeriod Operating Lease Liabilities\nNext one year(a)\n$ 520\n1-2 years 417\n2-3 years 322\n3-4 years 279\n4-5 years 217\nThereafter 1,865\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 3,621\nLess: Imputed interest\nPresent value of minimum lease payments 2,960\nLess: Current portion\nNoncurrent portion $ 2,510\n(a)Reflects lease payments due within 12 months subsequent to the balance sheet date.\nNote 16. Contingencies and Certain Commitments\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies. The following outlines our legal contingencies. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5B.\nA. Legal Proceedings\nOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:\nPatent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from that product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.\nProduct liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.\nCommercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.\nGovernment investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.\nWe believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 94\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAmounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.\nThe principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a readers judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.\nA1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation\nWe are involved in suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. For example, some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.\nWe also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) initiated proceedings with respect to two of our pneumococcal vaccine patents. However, the PTAB declined to initiate proceedings as to two other pneumococcal vaccine patents; those two patents, and one other patent, were challenged in federal court in Delaware. In September 2021, Pfizer and a challenger entered into a settlement and license agreement, resolving all worldwide legal proceedings involving that challenger, related to our pneumococcal vaccine patents. Other challenges to pneumococcal vaccine patents remain pending at the PTAB and outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines into the marketplace. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitors vaccine might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.\nWe are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. For example, our Hospira subsidiaries are involved in patent and patent-related disputes over their attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\nActions In Which We Are The Plaintiff\nEpiPen\nIn 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in connection with Sandozs abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.\nXeljanz (tofacitinib)\nBeginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.\nIn January 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Aurobindo Pharma Limited (Aurobindo) asserting the infringement and validity of the patent covering the active ingredient expiring in December 2025 and the patent covering a polymorphic form of tofacitinib expiring in 2023, which Aurobindo challenged in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg tablets.\nIn October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets.\nIn February 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Teva in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nIn February 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Slayback Pharma LLC (Slayback) asserting the infringement and validity of our compound patent covering the active ingredient that was challenged by Slayback in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib oral solution 1 mg/mL.\nInlyta (axitinib)\nIn 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Glenmark asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In 2019, we filed suit against Glenmark in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.\nIbrance (palbociclib)\nBeginning in September 2020, we received correspondence from several generic companies notifying us that they would seek approval to market generic versions of Ibrance capsules. The generic companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of our crystalline form patent which expires in 2034. Beginning in October 2020, we brought patent infringement actions against each of these generic companies in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent. We have settled with one of these generic companies on terms not material to the company.\nBeginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance tablets. The generic companies are challenging some or all of the following patents: (i) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2027; (ii) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2023; (iii) the method of use patent expiring in 2023; (iv) the crystalline form patent expiring in 2034; and (v) a tablet formulation patent expiring in 2036. We brought patent infringement actions against each of the generic filers in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies.\nEucrisa\nBeginning in September 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Eucrisa. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, two method of use patents expiring in 2027, and one other method of use patent expiring in 2030. In September 2021, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies.\nMatter Involving Our Collaboration/Licensing Partners\nEliquis\nIn 2017, twenty-five generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they had filed ANDAs seeking approval of generic versions of Eliquis, challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the three patents listed in the Orange Book for Eliquis. One of the patents expired in December 2019 and the remaining patents currently are set to expire in 2026 and 2031. Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized by BMS and Pfizer. BMS and Pfizer filed patent-infringement actions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of West Virginia, asserting that each of the generic companies proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) that each generic filer challenged. Some generic filers challenged only the 2031 patent, some challenged both the 2031 and 2026 patent, and one generic company challenged all three patents. In August 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that both the 2026 patent and the 2031 patent are valid and infringed by the proposed generic products. In August and September 2020, the generic filers appealed the District Courts decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Prior to the August 2020 ruling, we and BMS settled with certain of the companies on terms not material to us, and we and BMS may settle with other generic companies in the future. In September 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts decision.\nA2. Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation\nWe are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.\nAsbestos\nBetween 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.\nNumerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.\nThere also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.\nEffexor\nBeginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 96\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\npurported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nLipitor\nBeginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Courts orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nAlso, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.\nEpiPen (Direct Purchaser)\nIn February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nNexium 24HR and Protonix\nA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of our Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK, the JV has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR.\nDocetaxel\nPersonal Injury Actions\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nMississippi Attorney General Government Action\nIn 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product and eight other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.\nZantac\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 97\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nstatutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. Plaintiffs previously had filed a consolidated third-party payor class action complaint alleging violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute and seeking reimbursement for payments made for the prescription version of Zantac, but the Multi-District Litigation court dismissed that complaint; Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state court, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court.\nChantix\nBeginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizers voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.\nA3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters\nMonsanto-Related Matters\nIn 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.\nIn connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacias former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nIn connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutias indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsantos chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutias and New Monsantos assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsantos chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIn 2009, we submitted a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to the Wyeth Holdings Corporation (formerly, American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation executed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to the Bound Brook facility. In accordance with the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement, we completed construction of an interim remedy. In 2012, the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook facilitys main plant area. In 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for two adjacent lagoons. In 2015, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and to implement the remedy for the main plant area. The consent decree (which supersedes the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) was entered by the District Court in 2015. In 2018, the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the two adjacent lagoons. In 2019, Wyeth Holdings LLC entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the lagoons. In September 2021, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey, which the court approved in November 2021, that will allow Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and implement the remedy for the two adjacent lagoons.\nWe have accrued for the estimated costs of the site remedies for the Bound Brook facility.\nWe are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.\nContracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health\nIn 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals decision.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 98\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAllergan Complaint for Indemnity\nIn 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.\nBreach of Contract--Xalkori/Lorbrena\nWe are a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by New York University (NYU) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Supreme Court). NYU alleges that it is entitled to royalties on Pfizers sales of Xalkori under the terms of a Research and License Agreement between NYU and Sugen, Inc. Sugen, Inc. was acquired by Pharmacia in August 1999, and Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. The action was originally filed in 2013. In 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the action and, in 2017, the New York State Appellate Division reversed the decision and remanded the proceedings to the Supreme Court. In January 2020, the Supreme Court denied both parties summary judgment motions.\nIn October 2020, NYU filed a separate breach of contract action against Pfizer alleging that it is entitled to royalties on sales of Lorbrena under the terms of the same NYU-Sugen, Inc. Research and Licensing Agreement. In February 2022, the parties reached an agreement to settle both breach of contract actions on terms not material to Pfizer.\nViatris Securities Litigation\nIn October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatris common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each companys current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the Transactions. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.\nA4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.\nGreenstone Investigations\nU.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation\nSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.\nState Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation\nIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated with a Multi-District Litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the Multi-District Litigation in July 2020. The Multi-District Litigation also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.\nSubpoena relating to Manufacturing of Quillivant XR\nIn October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We have produced records pursuant to the subpoena.\nGovernment Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies\nIn February 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the SDNY. The civil investigative demand seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these requests.\nU.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations\nIn June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justices FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Russia. In September 2019, we received a similar request from the SECs FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.\nDocetaxel--Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation\nSee Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation--Docetaxel--Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation above for information regarding a government investigation related to Docetaxel marketing practices.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 99\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nU.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations\nIn March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our manufacturing operations in India, including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation concerning operations at our facilities in India. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.\nU.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to China Operations\nIn June 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in China. In August 2020, we received a similar request from the SECs FCPA Unit. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.\nZantac--State of New Mexico and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore Civil Actions\nSee Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation--Zantac above for information regarding civil actions separately filed by the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions.\nA5. Legal Proceedings--Matters Resolved During 2021\nDuring 2021, certain matters, including the matter discussed below, were resolved or became the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in-principle.\nEpiPen\nBeginning in 2017, purported class actions were filed in various federal courts by indirect purchasers of EpiPen against Pfizer, and/or its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan, and Mylan former Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch. The plaintiffs in these actions represent U.S. nationwide classes comprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct. Against Pfizer and/or its affiliates, plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that Pfizers and/or its affiliates settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal and various state antitrust laws. At least one lawsuit also alleges that Pfizer and/or Mylan violated RICO. Plaintiffs also filed various federal antitrust, state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims against, and relating to conduct attributable solely to, Mylan and/or its affiliates regarding EpiPen. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In 2017, all of these indirect purchase actions were consolidated for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas with other EpiPen-related actions against Mylan and/or its affiliates to which Pfizer, King and Meridian are not parties. In July 2021, Pfizer and plaintiffs filed a stipulation of settlement to resolve the Multi-District Litigation for $345 million. The District Court approved the settlement in November 2021, and the payment was made in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.\nB. Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations has been included in our financial statements and is not material to Pfizer.\nIn addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may agree to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, Viatris has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of certain matters.\nWe have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. See Note 7D.\nC. Certain Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had commitments totaling $5.2 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. These commitments include payments relating to potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur, and purchase obligations for goods and services.\nSee Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability.\nD. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions\nWe may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1E. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021 is $697 million, of which $135 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $563 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of December 31, 2020 is $689 million, of which $123 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $566 million in Other noncurrent liabilities. The increase in the contingent consideration balance from December 31, 2020 is primarily due to fair value adjustments, partially offset by payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones.\nE. Insurance\nOur insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 100\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\ncoverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\nNote 17. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\nA. Segment Information\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\nOther Costs and Business Activities\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\nWRDM--the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizers medicines.\nGPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\nCorporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\nCertain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\nSegment Assets\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 101\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nSelected Income Statement Information\nThe following table provides selected income statement information by reportable segment:\nRevenues Earnings(a)\nDepreciation and Amortization(b)\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nReportable Segment:\nBiopharma $ 79,557 $ 40,724 $ 38,013 $ 40,226 $ 27,089 $ 24,419 $ 1,439 $ 1,013 $ 978\nOther business activities(c)\n1,731 926 2,892 (10,396) (12,308) (11,216) 598 603 592\nReconciling Items:\nPurchase accounting adjustments - - - (3,175) (3,117) (4,153) 3,067 3,047 4,145\nAcquisition-related costs - - - (52) (44) (185) - - 3\nCertain significant items(d)\n- - - (2,292) (4,584) 2,456 87 18 37\n$ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905 $ 24,311 $ 7,036 $ 11,321 $ 5,191 $ 4,681 $ 5,755\n(a)Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.

For additional information, see Notes 2A, 2C, 3 and 4.\nB. Geographic Information\nThe following summarizes revenues by geographic area:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 29,746 $ 21,455 $ 20,326\nDeveloped Europe 18,336 7,788 7,729\nDeveloped Rest of World 12,506 4,036 4,022\nEmerging Markets 20,701 8,372 8,828\nRevenues\n$ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905\nRevenues exceeded $500 million in each of 21, 8 and 10 countries outside the U.S. in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The U.S. is the only country to contribute more than 10% of total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of revenues, our largest national market outside the U.S. was Japan, which contributed 9% of total revenue in 2021 and 6% in each of 2020 and 2019.\nWe and our collaboration partner, BioNTech, have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty under such agreements. We currently sell the Comirnaty vaccine directly to government and government sponsored customers. This includes supply agreements entered into in November 2020 and February and May 2021 with the EC on behalf of the different EU member states and certain other countries. Each EU member state submits its own Comirnaty vaccine order to us and is responsible for payment pursuant to terms of the supply agreements negotiated by the EC.\nC. Other Revenue Information\nSignificant Customers\nOur prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed as part of the Hospital therapeutic area. On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of the Mylan-Japan collaboration. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate. See Note 1A.\n(b)At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1. PC1, which previously had been managed within the Hospital therapeutic area, includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($320 million for 2021 and $0 million for 2020 and 2019), and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships, including but not limited to, transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Viatris following the spin-off of the Upjohn Business. We have revised prior period information to conform to the current management structure.\n(c)Prevnar family include revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult).\n(d)Biosimilars are highly similar versions of approved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima, Ruxience, Retacrit, Zirabev and Trazimera.\n(e)Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products include the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig.\n(f)On July 31, 2019, our Consumer Healthcare business, an OTC medicines business, was combined with GSKs consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare JV. See Note 2C.\n(g)Total Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital therapeutic area, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nContracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totals $34.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred and amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver the product to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, we expect to recognize revenue of\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 104\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n$22.3 billion in 2022, $11.8 billion in 2023 and $265 million in 2024. Remaining performance obligations exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.\nDeferred Revenues\nOur deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable in connection with contracts that we entered into during 2021 and 2020 with various government or government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues associated with the advance payments related to Comirnaty total $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $957 million as of December 31, 2020, with $3.0 billion and $249 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively as of December 31, 2021, and $957 million recorded in current liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Comirnaty deferred revenues during 2021 was the result of additional advance payments received as we entered into new or amended contracts or as we invoiced customers in advance of vaccine deliveries less amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered doses to our customers. During 2021, we recognized in revenue substantially all of the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2020. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as we deliver doses of the vaccine to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 105\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nQuarter\n(MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA) First Second Third Fourth\n2021(a)\nRevenues $ 14,516 $ 18,899 $ 24,035 $ 23,838\nCosts and expenses(b)\n8,802 11,951 15,546 19,876\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs(c)\n22 (1) 646 135\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss)\n5,692 6,949 7,843 3,827\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss)(d)\n808 1,123 (328) 249\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations 4,885 5,825 8,171 3,578\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax(e)\n1 (236) (13) (187)\nNet income/(loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests 4,886 5,589 8,159 3,391\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 26 12 (2)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 4,877 $ 5,563 $ 8,146 $ 3,393\nEarnings/(loss) per common share-basic:\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.87 $ 1.04 $ 1.45 $ 0.64\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax - (0.04) - (0.03)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 0.87 $ 0.99 $ 1.45 $ 0.60\nEarnings/(loss) per common share-diluted:\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.86 $ 1.02 $ 1.43 $ 0.62\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax - (0.04) - (0.03)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.86 $ 0.98 $ 1.42 $ 0.59\n(a)Business development activities impacted our results of operations in 2021.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nDuring our most recent fiscal quarter, there has not been any change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 107\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nPfizer Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 24, 2022\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 108\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Report\nWe prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in this Form 10-K. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of other financial information that is included in this document.\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Companys independent auditors have issued their auditors report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

[RESERVED]\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 25 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following is a summary of certain financial performance metrics (in billions, except per share data):\n2021 Total Revenues--$81.3 billion 2021 Net Cash Flow from Operations--$32.6 billion\nAn increase of 95% compared to 2020 An increase of 126% compared to 2020\n2021 Reported Diluted EPS--$3.85 2021 Adjusted Diluted EPS (Non-GAAP)--$4.42*\nAn increase of 137% compared to 2020 An increase of 96% compared to 2020\n*For additional information regarding Adjusted diluted EPS (which is a non-GAAP financial measure), including reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information, see the Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income section within MD&A.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and since they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOur Business and Strategy\nMost of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our former Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and PC1. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure. See Note 1A and Item 1. Business--Commercial Operations of this Form 10-K for additional information. We expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which, approximately 75% has been incurred since inception and through December 31, 2021. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nTransforming to a More Focused Company: We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. We are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. In addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. See the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section of this MD&A.\nR&D: We believe we have a strong pipeline and are well-positioned for future growth. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. Innovation, drug discovery and development are critical to our success. In addition to discovering and developing new\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 26\nproducts, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business-Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&D priorities and strategy.\nWe seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\nan aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients unmet needs;\nadvances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\nthe increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\nOur Business Development Initiatives\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\nAcquisition of Arena\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\nCollaboration with Biohaven\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec\u00ae ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to ex-U.S. sales.\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2.\nOur 2021 Performance\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 17C.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 27\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income\nThe increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $17.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to: (i) higher revenues, (ii) net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020, (iii) lower asset impairment charges, and (iv) higher net gains on equity securities, partially offset by (v) increases in: Cost of sales, Research and development expenses and Selling, informational and administrative expenses.\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4 for additional information.\nFor information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&A and Note 5.\nOur Operating Environment\nWe, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity\nOur product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a products overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a products labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.\nIntellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\nThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.\nRegulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures\nThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities if they go into effect. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business--Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and --Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.\nProduct Supply\nWe periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions or shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent Chantix recall. For information on our recent Chantix recall and risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section in this Form 10-K.\nThe Global Economic Environment\nIn addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions including inflation, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 28\nproduction, pricing, and marketing of, reimbursement for and access to our products, as well as impacts of political or civil unrest or military action, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems, inter-governmental disputes, public health outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters or disruptions related to climate change. Government pressures can lead to negative pricing pressure in various markets where governments take an active role in setting prices, access criteria or other means of cost control.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business, operations and financial condition and results.\nOur Response to COVID-19\nPfizer has helped lead the global effort to confront the COVID-19 pandemic by advancing a vision for industry-wide collaboration while making significant investments in breakthrough science and global manufacturing.\nComirnaty/BNT162b2:\n\u25e6We have collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty/BNT162b2, a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19. The FDA has approved Comirnaty in the U.S. to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older as a two-dose primary series (30 \u00b5g per dose). Comirnaty is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be granted approval by the FDA and had previously been available to this patient population in the U.S. under an EUA since December 2020. The vaccine is also available to individuals 5 to 15 years old under an EUA granted by the FDA in 2021 (10 \u00b5g per dose for children 5 through 11 years of age (October 2021) and 30 \u00b5g per dose for individuals 12 years of age and older (May 2021)). The FDA has also authorized for emergency use: (i) a third dose of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 in certain immunocompromised individuals 5 years of age and older and (ii) Comirnaty/BNT162b2 as a booster dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. Comirnaty/BNT162b2 has also been granted an approval or an authorization in many other countries around the world in populations varying by country. We continue to evaluate our vaccine, including for additional pediatric indications, and the short- and long-term efficacy of Comirnaty. We are also studying vaccine candidates to potentially prevent COVID-19 caused by new and emerging variants, such as the Omicron variant, or an updated vaccine as needed.\n\u25e6In 2021, we manufactured more than three billion doses and, in fiscal 2021, delivered 2.2 billion doses around the world. Pfizer and BioNTech expect we can manufacture up to four billion doses in total by the end of 2022. The companies have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty in 2022 with multiple developed and emerging countries around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty to governments under such agreements. We also signed agreements with multiple countries to supply Comirnaty doses in 2023 and are currently negotiating similar potential agreements with multiple other countries. We anticipate delivering at least two billion doses to low- and middle-income countries by the end of 2022-one billion that was delivered in 2021 and one billion expected to be delivered in 2022, with the possibility to increase those deliveries if more orders are placed by these countries for 2022. One billion of the aforementioned doses to low- and middle-income countries are being supplied to the U.S. government at a not-for-profit price to be donated to the worlds poorest nations at no charge to those countries.\n\u25e6As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $32 billion in revenues for Comirnaty in 2022, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, which includes doses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022 under contracts signed as of late-January 2022.\nPaxlovid:\n\u25e6In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid, a novel oral COVID-19 treatment, which is a SARS-CoV2-3CL protease inhibitor and is co-administered with a low dose of ritonavir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The FDA based its decision on clinical data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients), which enrolled non-hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. Paxlovid has been granted an authorization or approval in many other countries.\n\u25e6We continue to evaluate Paxlovid in other populations, including in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who are at standard risk (i.e., low risk of hospitalization or death) (Phase 2/3 EPIC-SR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Standard Risk Patients)) and in adults living in the same household as someone with a confirmed COVID-19 infection (Phase 2/3 EPIC-PEP (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in Post-Exposure Prophylaxis)).\n\u25e6We have entered into agreements with multiple countries to supply pre-specified courses of Paxlovid, such as the U.S. and U.K., and have initiated bilateral outreach to approximately 100 countries around the world. Additionally, we have signed a voluntary non-exclusive license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) for Paxlovid. Under the terms of the agreement, MPP can grant sublicenses to qualified generic medicine manufacturers worldwide to manufacture and supply Paxlovid to 95 low- and middle-income countries, covering up to approximately 53% of the worlds population.\n\u25e6Pfizer plans to manufacture up to 120 million treatment courses by the end of 2022, depending on the global need, which will be driven by advance purchase agreements, with 30 million courses expected to be produced in the first half of 2022 and the remaining 90 million courses expected to be produced in the second half of 2022.\n\u25e6As of February 8, 2022, we forecasted approximately $22 billion of revenues for Paxlovid in 2022, which includes treatment courses expected to be delivered in fiscal 2022, primarily relating to supply contracts signed or committed as of late-January 2022.\nIV Protease Inhibitor:\n\u25e6In February 2022, we discontinued the global clinical development program for PF-07304814, an intravenously administered SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitor being evaluated in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19. This decision was made based on a totality of information, including a careful review of early data and a thorough assessment of the candidates potential to successfully fulfill patient needs. Dosing of PF-07304814 in the National Institutes of Healths ongoing Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)-3 study has ceased.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business and Operations\nAs part of our on-going monitoring and assessment, we have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operational planning and financial projections, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic,\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 29\nas well as COVID-19 vaccine and oral COVID-19 treatment supply and contracts, which remain dynamic. Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results due to the uncertainty of future developments. We are focused on all aspects of our business and are implementing measures aimed at mitigating issues where possible, including by using digital technology to assist in operations for our commercial, manufacturing, R&D and corporate enabling functions globally.\nApart from our introduction of Comirnaty/BNT162b2 and Paxlovid, our business and operations have been impacted by the pandemic in various ways. Our portfolio of products experienced varying impacts from the pandemic in 2021. For example, certain of our vaccines such as the Prevnar family were impacted by disruptions to healthcare activity related to COVID-19, including the prioritization of primary and booster vaccination campaigns for COVID-19. For some products such as Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, we continued to see postponement of elective and diagnostic procedures in 2021 due to COVID-19, which may subside in 2022 as COVID-19 vaccination and booster rates continue to increase and/or if COVID-19 cases subside. On the other hand, some products such as Ibrance saw accelerating demand in 2021 as the delays in diagnosis and treatment initiations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic show signs of recovery across several international markets. For detail on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of our products, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income-Revenues by Geography and Revenues-Selected Product Discussion sections within this MD&A.\nIn 2021, engagement with healthcare professionals started to return to pre-pandemic levels and we continue to review and assess epidemiological data to inform in-person engagements with healthcare professionals and to help ensure the safety of our colleagues, customers and communities. As part of our commitment to engaging our customers in the manner they prefer, we are also taking a hybrid approach of virtual and in person engagements and saw customer response to both approaches. During the pandemic, we adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our digital capabilities to reach healthcare professionals and customers to provide critical education and information, including increasing the scale of our remote engagement. Most of our colleagues who are able to perform their job functions outside of our facilities continue to temporarily work remotely, while certain colleagues in the PGS and WRDM organizations continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocols intended to reduce the risk of transmission. As of December 31, 2021, more than 96% of our U.S. employee population had been fully vaccinated or received an approved exception. Also, in 2021 and to date, we have not seen a significant disruption to our supply chain, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. However, we are seeing an increase in overall demand in the industry for certain components and raw materials potentially constraining available supply, which could have a future impact on our business. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies in an effort to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. Certain of our clinical trials were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which included, in some cases, challenges related to recruiting clinical trial participants and accruing cases in certain studies. Our clinical trials also progressed in this challenging environment through innovation, such as decentralized visits (e.g., telemedicine and home visits) to accommodate participants ability to maintain scheduled visits, as well as working with suppliers to manage the shortage of certain clinical supplies.\nWe will continue to pursue efforts to maintain the continuity of our operations while monitoring for new developments related to the pandemic. Future developments could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impacts on our business, operations or financial condition and results. If we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chains or significant disruptions in clinical trials or other operations, or if demand for our products is significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition and results.\nFor additional information, please see the Item 1A. Risk Factors-COVID-19 Pandemic section of this Form 10-K.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nFollowing is a discussion about the critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. Also, see Note 1D.\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1. Of these policies, the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgments: Acquisitions (Note 1E); Fair Value (Note 1F); Revenues (Note 1H); Asset Impairments (Note 1M); Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies (Note 1Q); Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans (Note 1R); and Legal and Environmental Contingencies (Note 1S).\nFor a discussion of a recently adopted accounting standard and a change in accounting principle related to our pension and postretirement plans, see Notes 1B and 1C.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. For further detail on acquisition accounting, see Note 1E. Historically, intangible assets have been the most significant fair values within our business combinations. For further information on our process to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, see Asset Impairments below.\nRevenues\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends. If any of our ratios, factors, assessments, experiences or judgments are not indicative or accurate estimates of our future experience, our results could be materially affected. The potential of our estimates to vary (sensitivity) differs by program, product, type of customer and geographic location. However, estimates associated with U.S. Medicare, Medicaid and performance-based contract rebates are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 30\nbetween the recording of the accrual and its ultimate settlement, an interval that can generally range up to one year. Because of this lag, our recording of adjustments to reflect actual amounts can incorporate revisions of several prior quarters. Rebate accruals are product specific and, therefore for any period, are impacted by the mix of products sold as well as the forecasted channel mix for each individual product. For further information, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenue Deductions section within MD&A and Note 1H.\nAsset Impairments\nWe review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in Note 1M.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.\nA significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such as a restriction imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.\nAn expectation of losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitors product that impacts projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nWe use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible assets, other than goodwill. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which incorporates the consideration of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions that impact our fair value estimates include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological advancements and risk associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flows.\nWhile all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, those that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2021) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.\nGoodwill\nOur goodwill impairment review work as of December 31, 2021 concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.\nIn our review, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.\nWhen we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we typically use the income approach. The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, we use the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nFor all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results and the Item 1A. Risk Factors sections in this Form 10-K.\nBenefit Plans\nFor a description of our different benefit plans, see Note 11.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 31\nThe following provides (i) at the end of each year, the expected annual rate of return on plan assets for the following year, (ii) the actual annual rate of return on plan assets achieved in each year, and (iii) the weighted-average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations at the end of each year for our U.S. pension plans and our international pension plans(a):\n2021 2020 2019\nU.S. Pension Plans\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 6.3 % 6.8 % 7.0 %\nActual annual rate of return on plan assets 9.2 14.1 22.6\nDiscount rate used to measure the plan obligations 2.9 2.6 3.3\nInternational Pension Plans\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 3.1 3.4 3.6\nActual annual rate of return on plan assets 11.4 9.7 10.7\nDiscount rate used to measure the plan obligations 1.6 1.5 1.7\n(a)For detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see Note 11B.\nExpected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans.\nThe expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs to a 50 basis point decline in our assumption for the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):\nAssumption Change Increase in 2022\nNet Periodic\nBenefit Costs\nExpected annual rate of return on plan assets 50 basis point decline $133\nThe actual return on plan assets was approximately $2.6 billion during 2021.\nDiscount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements. The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity of net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations to a 10 basis point decline in our assumption for the discount rate, holding all other assumptions constant (in millions, pre-tax):\nAssumption Change Decrease in 2022 Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nIncrease to 2021 Benefit Obligations\nDiscount rate 10 basis point decline $16 $442\nThe change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $786 million.\nIncome Tax Assets and Liabilities\nIncome tax assets and liabilities include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions.

See the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues--Selected Product Discussion within MD&A for additional analysis\n780 124 656\nLower revenues for Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent:\nThe decrease for Chantix/Champix was driven by the voluntary recall across multiple markets in the second half of 2021 and the ongoing global pause in shipments of Chantix due to the presence of N-nitroso-varenicline above an acceptable level of intake set by various global regulators, the ultimate timing for resolution of which may vary by country, and the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a decline in patient visits to doctors for preventive health purposes\nThe decrease for Enbrel internationally primarily reflects continued biosimilar competition, which is expected to continue\nThe decrease for Sutent primarily reflects lower volume demand in the U.S. resulting from its loss of exclusivity in August 2021, as well as continued erosion as a result of increased competition in certain international developed markets\n(869) (501) (368)\nOther operational factors, net (27) (134) 106\nOperational growth, net 38,429 8,291 30,137\nFavorable impact of foreign exchange 1,208 - 1,208\nRevenues increase/(decrease)\n$ 39,637 $ 8,291 $ 31,346\nEmerging markets revenues increased $12.3 billion, or 147%, in 2021 to $20.7 billion from $8.4 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $12.2 billion, or 145%, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2%. The operational increase in emerging markets was primarily driven by revenues from Comirnaty and growth from certain products in the Hospital therapeutic area, Eliquis and PC1, partially offset by a decline from the Prevnar family.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 33\n2020 v. 2019\nThe following provides an analysis of the change in worldwide revenues by geographic areas in 2020:\n(MILLIONS) Worldwide U.S. International\nOperational growth/(decline):\nGrowth from Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Eliquis, Biosimilars, Ibrance, Inlyta, Xeljanz, Xtandi, the Hospital therapeutic area and the Prevnar family $ 3,560 $ 2,132 $ 1,428\nGrowth from PC1 in international markets driven by growth of certain key accounts as well new contract manufacturing activities\n114 (36) 151\nImpact of completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction.

The relatively flat operational performance was primarily driven by growth from Eliquis, the Prevnar family, Ibrance and Zavicefta, offset by lower revenues for Consumer Healthcare, reflecting the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction.\nRevenue Deductions\nOur gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.\nThe following presents information about revenue deductions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nMedicare rebates $ 726 $ 647 $ 628\nMedicaid and related state program rebates 1,214 1,136 1,259\nPerformance-based contract rebates 3,253 2,660 2,332\nChargebacks 6,122 4,531 3,411\nSales allowances 4,809 3,835 3,776\nSales returns and cash discounts 1,054 924 878\nTotal $ 17,178 $ 13,733 $ 12,284\nRevenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume, mix of products sold, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates.\nFor information on our accruals for revenue deductions, including the balance sheet classification of these accruals, see Note 1H.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 34\nRevenues-Selected Product Discussion\nBiopharma\nRevenue\n(MILLIONS) Year Ended Dec. 31, % Change\nProduct Global\nRevenues Region 2021 2020 Total Oper.

In February 2022, following a request from the FDA, a rolling submission seeking to amend the EUA to include children 6 months through 4 years of age (6 months to <5 years of age) was initiated as we wait for data evaluating a third 3 \u00b5g dose given at least two months after the second dose of the two-dose series in this age group. A booster dose received EUA from the FDA on September 22, 2021 for individuals 65 years of age and older, individuals 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe COVID-19, and individuals 18 through 64 years of age with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In addition, in October 2021, the FDA authorized for emergency use a booster dose to eligible individuals who have completed primary vaccination with a different authorized COVID-19 vaccine. Subsequently, the FDA expanded the booster EUA: (i) in November 2021 to include individuals 18 years of age and older, (ii) in December 2021 to include individuals 16 years of age and older and (iii) in January 2022 to include individuals 12 years of age and older as well as individuals 5 through 11 years of age who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise. A booster dose received conditional marketing authorization from the EMA in October 2021 for individuals 18 years of age and older and may be given to individuals 5 years and older with a severely weakened immune system, at least 28 days after their second dose. A booster dose received approval in Japan in November 2021 for 18 years of age and older.\n(b)Being developed in collaboration with Merck KGaA, Germany.\n(c)Being developed in collaboration with Astellas.\n(d)Being developed in collaboration with Myovant.\n(e)Being developed in collaboration with OPKO. In January 2022, Pfizer and OPKO received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA for the BLA for somatrogon. Pfizer is evaluating the CRL and will work with the FDA to determine an appropriate path forward in the U.S.\n(f)In October 2021, the CDCs ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 20 for routine use in adults. Specifically, the ACIP voted to recommend the following: (i) adults 65 years of age or older who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV20) or pneumococcal 15-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV15)). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23); and (ii) adults aged 19 years of age or older with certain underlying medical conditions or other risk factors who have not previously received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or whose previous vaccination history is unknown should receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (either PCV20 or PCV15). If PCV15 is used, this should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. The\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 39\nrecommendations were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on January 28, 2022. The publication also notes for adults who have received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) but have not completed their recommended pneumococcal vaccine series with PPSV23, one dose of Prevnar 20 may be used if PPSV23 is not available.\n(g)In December 2021, the FDA authorized the emergency use of Paxlovid for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg [88 lbs]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. In January 2022, the EMA approved the CMA of Paxlovid for treating COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of the disease becoming severe.\n(h)Under a commercialization arrangement with Biohaven.\nIn September 2021, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication (DSC) related to Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR and two competitors arthritis medicines in the same drug class, based on its completed review of the ORAL Surveillance trial. The DSC stated that the FDA will require revisions to the Boxed Warnings for each of these medicines to include information about the risks of serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. In addition, the DSC indicated the FDAs intention to limit approved uses of these products to certain patients who have not responded or cannot tolerate one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. In December 2021, in light of the results from the completed required postmarketing safety study of Xeljanz, ORAL Surveillance (A3921133), the U.S. label for Xeljanz was revised. In addition, at the request of the EC, the PRAC of the EMA has adopted a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to assess safety information relating to oral JAK inhibitors authorized for inflammatory diseases, including Xeljanz and Cibinqo, which is ongoing. For additional information, see Item 1A.

While avelumab showed clinical activity in this population, the study did not meet the primary endpoints of overall survival and progression-free survival in the high PD-L1+population for either of the avelumab dosing regimens evaluated. The safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program. Avelumab is not approved for the treatment of any patients with NSCLC. The outcome of the JAVELIN Lung 100 trial has no bearing on any of avelumabs currently-approved indications. Full results of the study will be shared at a future date.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, enrollment was stopped in C4591015 Study (a Phase 2/3 placebo controlled randomized observer-blind study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 against COVID-19 in healthy pregnant women 18 years of age and older). This study was developed prior to availability or recommendation for COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women. The environment changed during 2021 and by September 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were recommended by applicable recommending bodies (e.g., ACIP in the U.S.) for pregnant women in all participating/planned countries, and as a result the enrollment rate declined significantly. With the declining enrollment, the study had insufficient sample size to assess the primary immunogenicity objective and continuation of this placebo controlled study could no longer be justified due to global recommendations. This proposal was shared with and agreed to by FDA and EMA.\nFor additional information about our R&D organization, see the Item 1. Business-Research and Development section of this Form 10-K.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME\nAdjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance in conjunction with other performance measures. As such, we believe that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations--the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide--prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:\nMeasure Definition Relevance of Metrics to Our Business Performance\nAdjusted income Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nbefore the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\nProvides investors useful information to:\n\u25e6evaluate the normal recurring operational activities, and their components, on a comparable year-over-year basis\n\u25e6assist in modeling expected future performance on a normalized basis\nProvides investors insight into the way we manage our budgeting and forecasting, how we evaluate and manage our recurring operations and how we reward and compensate our senior management(b)\nAdjusted cost of sales, Adjusted selling, informational and administrative expenses, Adjusted research and development expenses, Adjusted amortization of intangible assets and Adjusted other (income)/deductions--net\nCost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other (income)/deductions--net (a), each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are components of the Adjusted income measure\nAdjusted diluted EPS EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted (a) before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items\n(a)Most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(b)The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part by three metrics, one of which is Adjusted diluted EPS, which is derived from Adjusted income and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, may be modified by our R&D performance as measured by four metrics relating to our pipeline and may be further modified by our Compensation Committees assessment of other factors.\nAdjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders, components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders-diluted, respectively. See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information-certain line items for 2021, 2020 and 2019 below.\nWe also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 41\nPurchase Accounting Adjustments\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.\nThe exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&D costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.\nAcquisition-Related Items\nAdjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAdjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\nCertain Significant Items\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.\nBeginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 42\nReconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 30,821 $ 12,703 $ 13,829 $ 3,700 $ (4,878) $ 21,979 $ 3.85\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n25 (3) 6 (3,088) (114) 3,175\nAcquisition-related items - - - - - 52\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - 585\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(108) (450) (1) - - 1,309\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (86) 86\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (1,056) - - 1,056\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 1,338 (1,338)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - 1,601 (1,601)\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (2,240) - - 2,240\nOther (52) (141) (15) - (334) (i)\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (2,848)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 30,685 $ 12,110 $ 10,523 $ 613 $ (2,473) $ 25,236 $ 4.42\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 8,484 $ 11,597 $ 9,393 $ 3,348 $ 1,219 $ 9,159 $ 1.63\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n18 (2) 5 (3,064) (75) 3,117\nAcquisition-related items - - - - - 44\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - (2,879)\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(61) (197) 2 - - 791\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (1,691) 1,691\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (454) - - 454\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 557 (557)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - (1,092) 1,092\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (50) - - 50\nOther (56) (292) (j)\n(24) - (697) (i)\n1,063\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (1,299)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 8,386 $ 11,106 $ 8,872 $ 284 $ (1,779) $ 12,727 $ 2.26\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 43\nData presented will not (in all cases) aggregate to totals.\nIN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA\nCost of sales Selling, informational and administrative expenses Research and development expenses Amortization of intangible assets Other (income)/deductions--net Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders(a)\nEarnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders--diluted\nGAAP reported $ 8,054 $ 12,726 $ 8,385 $ 4,429 $ 3,497 $ 16,026 $ 2.82\nPurchase accounting adjustments(b)\n19 2 4 (4,158) (21) 4,153\nAcquisition-related items - (2) - - - 185\nDiscontinued operations(c)\n- - - - - (6,056)\nCertain significant items:\nRestructuring charges/(credits) and implementation costs and additional depreciation-asset restructuring(d)\n(89) (73) (30) - - 611\nCertain asset impairments(e)\n- - - - (2,757) 2,757\nUpfront and milestone payments on collaborative and licensing arrangements(f)\n- - (279) - - 279\n(Gains)/losses on equity securities(g)\n- - - - 415 (415)\nActuarial valuation and other pension and postretirement plan (gains)/losses(g)\n- - - - (750) 750\n(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction - - - - - (8,107)\nAsset acquisitions of IPR&D(h)\n- - (337) - - 337\nOther (118) (190) (18) - (1,007) (i)\n1,333\nIncome tax provision-Non-GAAP items (797)\nNon-GAAP adjusted $ 7,865 $ 12,463 $ 7,726 $ 271 $ (623) $ 11,056 $ 1.95\n(a)Items that reconcile GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted balances are shown pre-tax and include discontinued operations.

For 2019, included a $337 million charge related to our acquisition of Therachon, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n(i)For 2021, the total of $334 million primarily includes: (i) charges representing our equity-method accounting pro rata share of restructuring charges and costs of preparing for separation from GSK of $185 million recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV and (ii) charges for certain legal matters of $162 million. For 2020, the total of $697 million primarily included: (i) charges of $367 million, which represent our equity-method accounting pro rata share of transaction-specific restructuring and business combination accounting charges recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV, and (ii) losses on asset disposals of $238 million. For 2019, the total of $1.0 billion primarily included: (i) $300 million of business and legal entity alignment costs for consulting, legal, tax and advisory services associated with the design, planning and implementation of our then new business structure, effective in the beginning of 2019, (ii) charges for certain legal matters of $291 million, (iii) charges of $152 million for external incremental costs, such as transaction costs and costs to separate our Consumer Healthcare business into a separate legal entity associated with the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV, (iv) net losses on early retirement of debt of $138 million and (v) charges of $112 million representing our equity-method accounting pro rata share of restructuring and business combination accounting charges recorded by the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n(j)For 2020, amounts in Selling, informational and administrative expenses of $292 million primarily include costs for consulting, legal, tax and advisory services associated with a non-recurring internal reorganization of legal entities.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 44\nANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nCash Flows from Continuing Operations\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019 Drivers of change\nCash provided by/(used in):\nOperating activities from continuing operations $ 32,922 $ 10,540 $ 7,015 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven primarily by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, the payment for the acquisition of Trillium, a decrease in contributions to pension plans, and the impact of timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, mostly from an increase in cash flows from Other current liabilities driven by: (i) a $9.7 billion accrual for the gross profit split due to BioNTech, (ii) an increase in royalties payable, as well as (iii) an increase in deferred revenues for advance payments in 2021 for Comirnaty.\nThe change in Other Adjustments, net, is mostly due to an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mainly by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, advanced payments in 2020 for Comirnaty recorded in deferred revenue, the upfront cash payment associated with our acquisition of Therachon in 2019, and the upfront cash payment associated with our licensing agreement with Akcea in 2019, partially offset by an increase in benefit plan contributions.\nThe change also reflects the impact of timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business.\nThe change in Other adjustments, net was driven primarily by an increase in equity method dividends received, partially offset by an increase in equity income and increases in net unrealized gains on equity securities.\nInvesting activities from continuing operations $ (22,534) $ (4,162) $ (3,825) 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven mainly by a $24.7 billion increase in purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months and a $9.0 billion increase in net purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less, partially offset by a $16.4 billion increase in redemptions of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mostly by a $6.0 billion decrease in net proceeds from short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less and $2.7 billion in net purchases of short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months in 2020 (compared to $2.3 billion net proceeds from short-term investments with original maturities of greater than three months in 2019), partially offset by the cash used to acquire Array, net of cash acquired, of $10.9 billion in 2019.\nFinancing activities from continuing operations $ (9,816) $ (21,640) $ (8,485) 2021 v. 2020\nThe change was driven mostly by a $9.8 billion net reduction in repayments of short-term borrowings with maturities of greater than three months, a $4.0 billion decrease in net payments on short-term borrowings with maturities of three months or less and a $2.0 billion reduction in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a $4.2 billion decrease in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe change was driven mostly by $14.0 billion net payments of short-term borrowings in 2020 (compared to $10.6 billion net proceeds raised from short-term borrowings in 2019) and an increase in cash dividends paid of $397 million, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of common stock of $8.9 billion, lower repayments on long-term debt of $2.8 billion, and an increase in issuances of long-term debt of $280 million.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nCash flows from discontinued operations primarily relate to our former Meridian subsidiary, Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration (see Note 2B). In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities from discontinued operations primarily reflects issuances of long-term debt.\nANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK\nDue to our significant operating cash flows, which is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source, as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreements, and available lines of credit, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 45\nWe focus efforts to optimize operating cash flows through achieving working capital efficiencies that target accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital. Excess cash from operating cash flows is invested in money market funds and available-for-sale debt securities which consist of primarily high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified debt securities. We have taken, and will continue to take, a conservative approach to our financial investments and monitoring of our liquidity position in response to market changes. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.\nAdditionally, we may obtain funding through short-term or long-term sources from our access to the capital markets, banking relationships and relationships with other financial intermediaries to meet our liquidity needs.\nDiverse sources of funds: Related disclosure presented in this Form 10-K\nInternal sources:\nOperating cash flows\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows - Operating Activities and the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within MD&A\nCash and cash equivalents\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nMoney market funds\nNote 7A\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nNote 7A, 7B\nExternal sources:\nShort-term funding:\nCommercial paper\nNote 7C\nRevolving credit facilities\nNote 7C\nLines of credit\nNote 7C\nLong-term funding:\nLong-term debt\nNote 7D\nEquity\nConsolidated Statements of Equity and Note 12\nFor additional information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this MD&A.\nIn August 2021, we completed a public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured sustainability notes. We are using the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part as follows: R&D expenses related to our COVID-19 vaccines, capital expenditures in connection with the manufacture and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and our other projects that have environmental and/or social benefits. For additional information, see Note 7D.\nCredit Ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and increases or decreases in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moodys. In November 2020, upon the completion of the Upjohn separation, both Moodys and S&P lowered our long-term debt rating one notch to \u2018A2 and \u2018A+, respectively, and our short-term rating remained unchanged. S&P continues to rate our long-term debt rating outlook as Stable since November 2020, while Moodys recently upgraded our long-term debt rating outlook to Positive in December 2021.\nThe current ratings assigned to our commercial paper and senior unsecured long-term debt:\nNAME OF RATING AGENCY Pfizer Short-Term Rating Pfizer Long-Term Rating Outlook/Watch\nMoodys P-1 A2 Positive\nS&P A-1+ A+ Stable\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nCapital Allocation Framework\nOur capital allocation framework is devised to facilitate (i) the achievement of medical breakthroughs through R&D investments and business development activities and (ii) returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our Business and Strategy section of this MD&A.\nOur current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our business. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizers BOD and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. In December 2021, our BOD declared a first-quarter dividend of $0.40 per share, payable on March 4, 2022, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 28, 2022. The first-quarter 2022 cash dividend will be our 333rd consecutive quarterly dividend.\nSee Note 12 for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2021, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual, and Other Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, (i) we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that may result in contractual and other obligations and (ii) in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 46\nmay arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities. For more information on guarantees and indemnifications, see Note 16B.\nAdditionally, certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products. Furthermore, collaboration, licensing or other R&D arrangements may give rise to potential milestone payments. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.\nOur significant contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021 consisted of:\nLong-term debt, including current portion (see Note 7) and related interest payments;\nEstimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation estimated tax liability (see Note 5). Estimated future payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax liability that will occur after December 31, 2021 total $8.3 billion, of which an estimated $750 million is to be paid in the next twelve months and an estimated $7.6 billion is to be paid in periods thereafter;\nCertain commitments totaling $5.2 billion, of which an estimated $1.5 billion is to be paid in the next twelve months, and $3.7 billion in periods thereafter (see Note 16C);\nPurchases of property plant and equipment (see Note 9). In 2022, we expect to spend approximately $3.3 billion on property, plant and equipment; and\nFuture minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases (see Note 15).\nGlobal Economic Conditions\nOur Venezuela and Argentina operations function in hyperinflationary economies. The impact to Pfizer is not considered material. For additional information on the global economic environment, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Global Operations section in this Form 10-K.\nMarket Risk\nWe are subject to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and equity price risk. The objective of our financial risk management program is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements on our earnings. We address such exposures through a combination of operational means and financial instruments. For more information on how we manage our foreign exchange and interest rate risks, see Notes 1G and 7E, as well as the Item 1A. Risk Factors-Global Operations section in this Form 10-K for key currencies in which we operate. Our sensitivity analyses of such risks are discussed below.\nForeign Exchange Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming that a change in one currencys rate relative to the U.S. dollar would not have any effect on another currencys rates relative to the U.S. dollar, if the dollar were to appreciate against all other currencies by 10%, as of December 31, 2021, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nInterest Rate Risk-The fair values of our financial instrument holdings are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes. In this analysis, holding all other assumptions constant and assuming a parallel shift in the interest rate curve for all maturities and for all instruments, if there were a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2021, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nEquity Price Risk--We hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values in life science companies as a result of certain business development transactions. While we are holding such securities, we are subject to equity price risk, and this may increase the volatility of our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. From time to time, we will sell such equity securities based on our business considerations, which may include limiting our price risk. Our equity securities with readily determinable fair values are analyzed at year-end to determine their sensitivity to equity price rate changes. In this sensitivity analysis, the expected adverse impact on our net income would not be significant.\nLIBOR\nFor information on interest rate risk and LIBOR, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Global Operations section in this Form 10-K. We do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 47\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standard\nSee Note 1B.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2021\nStandard/Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements\nReference rate reform provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued after 2021 because of reference rate reform.\nThe new guidance provides the following optional expedients:\n1.Simplify accounting analyses under current U.S. GAAP for contract modifications.\n2.Simplify the assessment of hedge effectiveness and allow hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform to continue.\n3.Allow a one-time election to sell or transfer debt securities classified as held to maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform.\nElections can be adopted prospectively at any time through December 31, 2022. We are assessing the impact, but currently, we do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606. This new guidance will generally result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same amounts that were recorded by the acquiree. Previously, these amounts were recognized by the acquirer at fair value as of the acquisition date.\nJanuary 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the discussion in the Analysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, Capital Resources and Market Risk section within MD&A.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 48 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders\nPfizer Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\nAs discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Companys revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Companys estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Companys ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\nEvaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1Q, the Companys tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Companys tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nWe identified the evaluation of the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the Companys interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the Companys liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the Companys tax positions may not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estimation and recording of the gross unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the Companys interpretation of tax laws, including the assessment of transfer pricing practices in accordance with applicable tax laws and regulations. We inspected settlements with applicable taxing authorities, including assessing the expiration of statutes of limitations. We tested the calculation of the liability for uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the Companys assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and estimates of the amount of tax benefits expected to be sustained.\nEvaluation of product and other product-related litigation\nAs discussed in Notes 1S and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in product liability and other product-related litigation, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others. Certain of these pending product and other product-related legal proceedings could result in losses that could be substantial. The accrued liability and/or disclosure for the pending product and other product-related legal proceedings requires a complex series of judgments by the Company about future events, which involves a number of uncertainties.\nWe identified the evaluation of product and other product-related litigation as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Companys judgments about future events and uncertainties.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys product liability and other product-related litigation processes, including controls related to (1) the evaluation of information from external and internal legal counsel, (2) forward-looking expectations, and (3) new legal proceedings, or other legal proceedings not currently reserved or disclosed. We read letters received directly from the Companys external and internal legal counsel that described the Companys probable or reasonably possible legal contingency to pending product and other product-related legal proceedings. We inspected the Companys minutes from meetings of the Audit Committee, which included the status of key litigation matters.

See Note 2C.\nSee Accompanying Notes.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nA. Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our parent company and all subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The decision of whether or not to consolidate an entity for financial reporting purposes requires consideration of majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other control over the entity. Typically, we do not seek control by means other than voting interests. For subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., the financial information is included as of and for the year ended November 30 for each year presented. Pfizer's fiscal year-end for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the year ended December 31 for each year presented. Substantially all unremitted earnings of international subsidiaries are free of legal and contractual restrictions. All significant transactions among our subsidiaries have been eliminated.\nAt the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. See Note 17. On December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary, the manufacturer of EpiPen and other auto-injector products. Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed within the Hospital therapeutic area. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of a pre-existing strategic collaboration between Pfizer and Mylan for generic drugs in Japan (the Mylan-Japan collaboration) pursuant to an agreement dated November 13, 2020, and we transferred related inventories and operations that were part of the Mylan-Japan collaboration to Viatris. On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and the Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities associated with Meridian and the Mylan-Japan collaboration are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of December 31, 2020. Upon completion of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business on November 16, 2020, the Upjohn assets and liabilities were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet and are reflected in Retained Earnings-Distribution of Upjohn Business in the consolidated statement of equity. Prior to the spin-off of the Upjohn Business in November 2020, the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian were managed as part of our former Upjohn operating segment. With the separation of the Upjohn Business, the Mylan-Japan collaboration and Meridian, as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. In addition, other acquisitions and business development activities completed in 2021, 2020 and 2019 impacted financial results in the periods presented. See Note 2.\nCertain amounts in the consolidated financial statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.\nB. New Accounting Standard Adopted in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted a new accounting standard for income tax that eliminates certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nC. Change in Accounting Principle\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we adopted a change in accounting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans (MTM Accounting). Under the prior policy, we deferred recognition of these gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The accumulated actuarial gains/losses outside of a corridor were then amortized into net periodic benefit costs over the average remaining service period or the average life expectancy of participants. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented, and as of January 1, 2019, resulted in a cumulative effect decrease to Retained earnings of $6.0 billion, with a corresponding offset to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Each time a pension or postretirement plan is remeasured, the actuarial gain or loss is recognized immediately and classified as Other (income)/deductions--net.\nWe believe that MTM Accounting is a more preferable policy as it provides improved transparency of results and performance, better alignment with fair value accounting principles and a better reflection of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions and the actuarial impact of plan remeasurements.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe impacts of the adjustments on our consolidated financial statements are summarized as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Income:\n(Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction $ - $ - $ - $ (6) $ - $ (6) $ (8,086) $ (21) $ (8,107)\nOther (income)/deductions--net (2,820) (2,058) (4,878) 672 547 1,219 3,264 233 3,497\nIncome from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income 22,253 2,058 24,311 7,584 (547) 7,036 11,533 (212) 11,321\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income 1,399 453 1,852 496 (125) 370 631 (48) 583\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (434) - (434) 2,564 (35) 2,529 5,400 (82) 5,318\nNet income before allocation to noncontrolling interests 20,420 1,605 22,025 9,652 (457) 9,195 16,302 (246) 16,056\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 20,374 1,605 21,979 9,616 (457) 9,159 16,273 (246) 16,026\nEarnings per common share--basic:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.71 $ 0.29 $ 4.00 $ 1.27 $ (0.08) $ 1.19 $ 1.95 $ (0.03) $ 1.92\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) - (0.08) 0.46 (0.01) 0.46 0.97 (0.01) 0.95\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 3.63 0.29 3.92 1.73 (0.08) 1.65 2.92 (0.04) 2.88\nEarnings per common share--diluted:\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 3.65 $ 0.28 $ 3.93 $ 1.25 $ (0.07) $ 1.18 $ 1.92 $ (0.03) $ 1.89\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax (0.08) - (0.08) 0.46 (0.01) 0.45 0.95 (0.01) 0.94\nNet income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders 3.57 0.28 3.85 1.71 (0.08) 1.63 2.87 (0.04) 2.82\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(MILLIONS) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:\nForeign currency translation adjustments, net $ (731) $ 49 $ (682) $ 957 $ (185) $ 772 $ 654 $ 21 $ 675\nBenefit plans: actuarial gains/(losses), net 1,565 (1,565) - (1,128) 1,128 - (826) 826 -\nReclassification adjustments related to amortization 285 (285) - 276 (276) - 241 (241) -\nReclassification adjustments related to settlements, net 209 (209) - 278 (278) - 274 (274) -\nOther 49 (49) - (189) 189 - 22 (22) -\nTax provision/(benefit) on other comprehensive income/(loss) 545 (475) 71 (349) 122 (227) 115 63 178\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nDeferred taxes from continuing operations $ (4,746) $ 453 $ (4,293) $ (1,449) $ (125) $ (1,575) $ 609 $ (48) $ 561\nBenefit plan contributions in excess of expense/income (1,065) (2,058) (3,123) (1,790) 547 (1,242) (288) 233 (55)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020\n(MILLIONS) Previous\nAccounting\nPrinciple Impact of Change As Reported Previous Accounting Principle Impact of Change As Adjusted\nConsolidated Balance Sheets:\nNoncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets $ 3,320 $ 22 $ 3,341 $ 2,383 $ - $ 2,383\nOther noncurrent assets 7,679 - 7,679 4,879 - 4,879\nPension benefit obligations 3,489 - 3,489 4,766 - 4,766\nRetained earnings 101,789 1,605 103,394 96,770 (6,378) 90,392\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (4,313) (1,583) (5,897) (11,688) 6,378 (5,310)\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nD. Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing these financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions can impact all elements of our financial statements. For example, in the consolidated statements of income, estimates are used when accounting for deductions from revenues, determining the cost of inventory that is sold, allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization, and estimating restructuring charges and the impact of contingencies, as well as determining provisions for taxes on income. On the consolidated balance sheets, estimates are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of assets, and in determining the reported amounts of liabilities, all of which also impact the consolidated statements of income. Certain estimates of fair value and amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, revenue deductions, impairment reviews, restructuring-associated charges, investments and financial instruments, valuation allowances, pension and postretirement benefit plans, contingencies, share-based compensation, and other calculations can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions.\nOur estimates are often based on complex judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If our estimates and assumptions are not representative of actual outcomes, our results could be materially impacted. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and expectations about the future. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change.\nE. Acquisitions\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses after the completion of the acquisitions. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired IPR&D be recorded on the balance sheet. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When we acquire net assets that do not constitute a business, as defined in U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed in Research and development expenses.\nContingent consideration in a business combination is included as part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair value is generally estimated by using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow approach. See Note 16D. Any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. These changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in Other (income)/deductions--net.\nF. Fair Value\nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting. We estimate fair value using an exit price approach, which requires, among other things, that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market. The determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participants, considering the highest and best use of non-financial assets and, for liabilities, assuming that the risk of non-performance will be the same before and after the transfer.\nWhen estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:\nIncome approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows.\nMarket approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nCost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.\nOur fair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:\nQuoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs).\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs).\nUnobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).\nThe following inputs and valuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities:\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit-adjusted yield curves.\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values-quoted market prices and observable NAV prices.\nDerivative assets and liabilities-third-party matrix-pricing model that uses inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Where applicable, these models use market-based observable inputs, including interest rate yield curves to discount future cash flow amounts, and forward and spot prices for currencies. The credit risk impact to our derivative financial instruments was not significant.\nMoney market funds-observable NAV prices.\nWe periodically review the methodologies, inputs and outputs of third-party pricing services for reasonableness. Our procedures can include, for example, referencing other third-party pricing models, monitoring key observable inputs (like benchmark interest rates) and selectively performing test-comparisons of values with actual sales of financial instruments.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nG. Foreign Currency Translation\nFor most of our international operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. We translate functional currency assets and liabilities to their U.S. dollar equivalents at exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and income and expense amounts at average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates are recorded in Other comprehensive income/(loss). The effects of converting non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities into the functional currency are recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net. For operations in highly inflationary economies, we translate monetary items at rates in effect as of the balance sheet date, with translation adjustments recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net, and we translate non-monetary items at historical rates.\nH. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\nRevenue Recognition--We record revenues from product sales when there is a transfer of control of the product from us to the customer. We typically determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title passes to the customer.\nOur Sales Contracts--Sales on credit are typically under short-term contracts. Collections are based on market payment cycles common in various markets, with shorter cycles in the U.S. Sales are adjusted for sales allowances, chargebacks, rebates and sales returns and cash discounts. Sales returns occur due to LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment.\nDeductions from Revenues--Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period.\nProvisions for pharmaceutical sales returns--Provisions are based on a calculation for each market that incorporates the following, as appropriate: local returns policies and practices; historical returns as a percentage of sales; an understanding of the reasons for past returns; estimated shelf life by product; an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time; and any other factors that could impact the estimate of future returns, such as LOE, product recalls or a changing competitive environment. Generally, returned products are destroyed, and customers are refunded the sales price in the form of a credit.\nWe record sales incentives as a reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentive is offered, whichever is later. We estimate the cost of our sales incentives based on our historical experience with similar incentives programs to predict customer behavior.\nThe following outlines our common sales arrangements:\nCustomers--Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. Prescription pharmaceutical products that ultimately are used by patients are generally covered under governmental programs, managed care programs and insurance programs, including those managed through PBMs, and are subject to sales allowances and/or rebates payable directly to those programs. Those sales allowances and rebates are generally negotiated, but government programs may have legislated amounts by type of product (e.g., patented or unpatented).\nSpecifically:\nIn the U.S., we sell our products principally to distributors and hospitals. We also have contracts with managed care programs or PBMs and legislatively mandated contracts with the federal and state governments under which we provide rebates based on medicines utilized by the lives they cover. We record provisions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract pharmaceutical rebates based upon our experience ratio of rebates paid and actual prescriptions written during prior periods. We apply the experience ratio to the respective periods sales to determine the rebate accrual and related expense. This experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trends are as current as practicable. We estimate discounts on branded prescription drug sales to Medicare Part D participants in the Medicare coverage gap, also known as the doughnut hole, based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescriptions and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap. We evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trends and future expectations are as current as practicable. For performance-based contract rebates, we also consider current contract terms, such as changes in formulary status and rebate rates.\nOutside the U.S., the majority of our pharmaceutical sales allowances are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimates are based on actual invoiced sales within each period, which reduces the risk of variations in the estimation process. In certain European countries, rebates are calculated on the governments total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sales thresholds and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sales to project the expected level of reimbursement. We obtain third-party information that helps us to monitor the adequacy of these accruals.\nProvisions for pharmaceutical chargebacks (primarily reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices and legislated discounts to third parties) closely approximate actual amounts incurred, as we settle these deductions generally within two to five weeks of incurring the liability.\nWe recorded direct product sales and/or Alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of nine products in 2021, for each of seven products in 2020 and for each of six products in 2019. In the aggregate, these direct products sales and/or alliance product revenues represented 75% of our revenues in 2021, 54% of our revenues in 2020 and 49% of our revenues in 2019. See Note 17B for additional information. The loss or expiration of intellectual property rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues as our contracts with customers will generally be at lower selling prices and lower volumes due to added generic competition. We generally provide for higher sales returns during the period in which individual markets begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nOur accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nReserve against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts\n$ 1,077 $ 861\nOther current liabilities:\nAccrued rebates 3,811 3,017\nOther accruals 528 432\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n433 399\nTotal accrued rebates and other sales-related accruals $ 5,850 $ 4,708\nTaxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Revenues.\nTrade Accounts Receivable-Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.\nIn determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. These credit risk indicators are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether there have been any changes in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentages should be adjusted, and are considered on a regional basis to reflect more geographic-specific metrics. Additionally, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables are tracked against collections on a quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve percentages remain appropriate. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded. Trade accounts receivable are written off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nI. Collaborative Arrangements\nPayments to and from our collaboration partners are presented in our consolidated statements of income based on the nature of the arrangement (including its contractual terms), the nature of the payments and applicable accounting guidance. Under co-promotion agreements, we record the amounts received for our share of gross profits from our collaboration partners as alliance revenues, a component of Revenues, when our collaboration partners are the principal in the transaction and we receive a share of their net sales or profits. Alliance revenues are recorded as we perform co-promotion activities for the collaboration and the collaboration partners sell the products to their customers. The related expenses for selling and marketing these products including reimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for these costs are included in Selling, informational and administrative expenses. In collaborative arrangements where we manufacture a product for our collaboration partners, we record revenues when we transfer control of the product to our collaboration partners. In collaboration arrangements where we are the principal in the transaction, we record amounts paid to collaboration partners for their share of net sales or profits earned, and all royalty payments to collaboration partners as Cost of sales. Royalty payments received from collaboration partners are included in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nReimbursements to or from our collaboration partners for development costs are typically recorded in Research and development expenses. Upfront payments and pre-approval milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners in development stage collaborations are recorded as Research and development expenses. Milestone payments due from us to our collaboration partners after regulatory approval has been attained for a medicine are recorded in Identifiable intangible assets-Developed technology rights. Upfront and pre-approval milestone payments earned from our collaboration partners by us are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net over the development period for the products, when our performance obligations include providing R&D services to our collaboration partners. Upfront, pre-approval and post-approval milestone payments earned by us may be recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net immediately when earned or over other periods depending upon the nature of our performance obligations in the applicable collaboration. Where the milestone event is regulatory approval for a medicine, we generally recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price when regulatory approval in the applicable jurisdiction has been attained. We may recognize milestone payments due to us in the transaction price earlier than the milestone event in certain circumstances when recognition of the income would not be probable of a significant reversal.\nJ. Cost of Sales and Inventories\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of finished goods, work in process and raw materials is determined using average actual cost. We regularly review our inventories for impairment and reserves are established when necessary.\nK. Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and handling, information technology and legal defense. Advertising expenses totaled approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $2.3 billion in 2019. Production costs are expensed as incurred and the costs of TV, radio, and other electronic media and publications are expensed when the related advertising occurs.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nL. Research and Development Expenses\nR&D costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses include the costs of our proprietary R&D efforts, as well as costs incurred in connection with certain licensing arrangements. Before a compound receives regulatory approval, we record upfront and milestone payments we make to third parties under licensing arrangements as expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred, and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved. Once a compound receives regulatory approval, we record any milestone payments in Identifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization and, unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite life, we typically amortize the payments on a straight-line basis over the remaining agreement term or the expected product life cycle, whichever is shorter.\nM. Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include:\nProperty, plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation-These assets are recorded at cost, including any significant improvements after purchase, less accumulated depreciation. Property, plant and equipment assets, other than land and construction in progress, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual assets. Depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation methods are used as allowed by tax laws.\nIdentifiable intangible assets, less accumulated amortization-These assets are recorded at fair value at acquisition. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized until a useful life can be determined.\nGoodwill-Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred for an acquired business over the assigned values of its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized.\nAmortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets that contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market and distribute products, compounds and intellectual property is included in Amortization of intangible assets as these intangible assets benefit multiple business functions. Amortization of intangible assets that are for a single function and depreciation of property, plant and equipment are included in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.\nSpecifically:\nFor finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, whenever impairment indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and compare this estimated amount to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an impairment loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review, we reevaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IPR&D assets, when necessary, we determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an impairment review other than for IPR&D assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.\nFor goodwill, when necessary, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an impairment loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the implied fair value.\nN. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nWe may incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we implement plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.\nIn connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which may include expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes), and restructuring the combined company (which may include charges related to employees, assets and activities that will not continue in the combined company); and\nIn connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the development of global systems.\nIncluded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired business. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estimated useful life of an asset, that incremental impact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate. Employee termination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estimable and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirement benefits, many of which may be paid out during periods after termination. Transaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other similar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred.\nOur business and platform functions may be impacted by these actions, including sales and marketing, manufacturing and R&D, as well as our corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement).\nO. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flows\nCash equivalents include items almost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and time deposits with maturity periods of three months or less when purchased. If items meeting this definition are part of a larger investment pool, we classify them as Short-term investments.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 62\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nCash flows for financial instruments designated as fair value or cash flow hedges may be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows for financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrument. Cash flows for financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.\nP. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments\nThe classification of an investment depends on the nature of the investment, our intent and ability to hold the investment, and the degree to which we may exercise influence. Our investments are primarily comprised of the following:\nPublic equity securities with readily determinable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost.\nPrivate equity securities without readily determinable fair values and where we have no significant influence are measured at cost minus any impairment and plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nFor equity investments in common stock or in-substance common stock where we have significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee, we use the equity-method of accounting. Under the equity-method, we record our share of the investees income and expenses in Other (income)/deductions-net. The excess of the cost of the investment over our share of the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee as of the acquisition date is allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee, with any remaining excess amount allocated to goodwill. Such investments are initially recorded at cost, which is the fair value of consideration paid and typically does not include contingent consideration.\nRealized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined by using the specific identification cost method.\nWe regularly evaluate all of our financial assets for impairment. For investments in debt and equity, when a decline in fair value, if any, is determined, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established.\nDerivative financial instruments are carried at fair value in various balance sheet categories (see Note 7A), with changes in fair value reported in Net income or, for derivative financial instruments in certain qualifying hedging relationships, in Other comprehensive income/(loss) (see Note 7E).\nQ. Tax Assets and Liabilities and Income Tax Contingencies\nTax Assets and Liabilities\nCurrent tax assets primarily include (i) tax effects for intercompany transfers of inventory within our combined group, which are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the inventory is sold to a third party and (ii) income tax receivables that are expected to be recovered either via refunds from taxing authorities or reductions to future tax obligations.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance when we believe that our deferred tax assets are not recoverable based on an assessment of estimated future taxable income that incorporates ongoing, prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies, that would be implemented, if necessary, to realize the deferred tax assets. Amounts recorded for valuation allowances requires judgments about future income which can depend heavily on estimates and assumptions. All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same tax jurisdiction are presented as a net amount in the noncurrent section of our consolidated balance sheet.\nThe TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years.\nOther non-current tax assets primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction.\nOther taxes payable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 include liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the noncurrent portion of the repatriation tax liability for which we elected payment over eight years through 2026. For additional information, see Note 5D for uncertain tax positions and Note 5A for the repatriation tax liability and other estimates and assumptions in connection with the TCJA.\nIncome Tax Contingencies\nWe account for income tax contingencies using a benefit recognition model. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize all or a portion of the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 63\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nWe regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the unrecognized tax benefit: (i) if there are changes in tax law, analogous case law or there is new information that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) if the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) if there is a completion of an audit resulting in a favorable settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when we expect to pay cash within the next 12 months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and are classified on our consolidated balance sheet with the related tax liability.\nOur assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution.\nR. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we have both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of each of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability. The obligations are generally measured at the actuarial present value of all benefits attributable to employee service rendered, as provided by the applicable benefit formula. Our pension and other postretirement obligations may be determined using assumptions such as discount rate, expected annual rate of return on plan assets, expected employee turnover and participant mortality. For our pension plans, the obligation may also include assumptions as to future compensation levels. For our other postretirement benefit plans, the obligation may include assumptions as to the expected cost of providing medical insurance benefits, as well as the extent to which those costs are shared with the employee or others (such as governmental programs). Plan assets are measured at fair value. Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs other than the service costs are recognized in Other (income)/deductions-net.\nS. Legal and Environmental Contingencies\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, such as patent litigation, product liability and other product-related litigation, commercial litigation, environmental claims and proceedings, government investigations and guarantees and indemnifications. In assessing contingencies related to legal and environmental proceedings that are pending against the Company, or unasserted claims that are probable of being asserted, we record accruals for these contingencies to the extent that we conclude that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we accrue that amount. Alternatively, when no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the lowest amount in the range. We record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when recovery is assured.\nT. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payments. Generally, grants under share-based payment programs are accounted for at fair value and these fair values are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting terms with the related costs recorded in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses, as appropriate.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative Arrangements\nA. Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nArrays portfolio includes Braftovi (encorafenib) and Mektovi (binimetinib), a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in different stages of R&D, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed medicines, which may generate milestones and royalties over time.\nThe final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in 2020. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded: (i) $6.3 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $2.0 billion of Developed technology rights with a useful life of 16 years, $2.8 billion of IPR&D and $1.5 billion of Licensing agreements and other ($1.2 billion for technology in development--indefinite-lived licensing agreements and $360 million for developed technology--finite-lived licensing agreements with a useful life of 10 years), (ii) $6.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $1.1 billion of net deferred tax liabilities and (iv) $451 million of assumed long-term debt, which was paid in full in 2019.\nIn 2020, we recorded measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair values initially recorded in 2019, which resulted in a reduction in Identifiable intangible assets of approximately $900 million with a corresponding change to Goodwill and net deferred tax liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded to better reflect market participant assumptions about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date and did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTherachon\nOn July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was $322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.\nB. Divestitures\nMeridian\nOn December 31, 2021, we completed the sale of our Meridian subsidiary for approximately $51 million in cash and recognized a loss of approximately $167 million, net of tax, in Discontinued operations--net of tax. In connection with the sale, Pfizer and the purchaser of Meridian entered into various agreements to provide a framework for our relationship after the sale, including interim TSAs and a manufacturing supply agreement (MSA). The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services related to information technology, among other activities, and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than 12 to 18 months post sale. The MSA is for a term of three years post sale with a two year extension period. No amounts were recorded under the above arrangements in 2021.\nUpjohn Separation and Combination with Mylan\nOn November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan (the Transactions) to form Viatris.\nThe Transactions were structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction. Specifically, (i) we contributed the Upjohn Business to a wholly owned subsidiary, which was renamed Viatris, so that the Upjohn Business was separated from the remainder of our business (the Separation), (ii) following the Separation, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of Viatris common stock held by Pfizer to Pfizer stockholders as of the November 13, 2020 record date, such that each Pfizer stockholder as of the record date received approximately 0.124079 shares of Viatris common stock per share of Pfizer common stock (the Distribution); and (iii) immediately after the Distribution, the Upjohn Business combined with Mylan in a series of transactions in which Mylan shareholders received one share of Viatris common stock for each Mylan ordinary share held by such shareholder, subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the Combination). Prior to the Distribution, Viatris made a cash payment to Pfizer equal to $12.0 billion as partial consideration for the contribution of the Upjohn Business to Viatris. As of the closing of the Combination, Pfizer stockholders owned approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, and Mylan shareholders owned approximately 43% of the outstanding shares of Viatris common stock, in each case on a fully diluted, as-converted and as-exercised basis. The Transactions are generally expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer stockholders for U.S. tax purposes. Beginning November 16, 2020, Viatris operates both the Upjohn Business and Mylan as an independent publicly traded company, which is traded under the symbol VTRS on the NASDAQ.\nIn connection with the Transactions, in June 2020, Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. completed privately placed debt offerings of $7.45 billion and \u20ac3.60 billion aggregate principal amounts, respectively, (approximately $11.4 billion) of senior unsecured notes and entered into other financing arrangements, including a $600 million delayed draw term loan agreement and a revolving credit facility agreement for up to $4.0 billion. Proceeds from the debt offerings and other financing arrangements were used to fund the $12.0 billion cash distribution Viatris made to Pfizer prior to the Distribution. We used the cash distribution proceeds to pay down commercial paper borrowings and redeem the $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.95% senior unsecured notes that were due in June 2021 and $342 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 5.80% senior unsecured notes that were due in August 2023, before the maturity date. Interest expense for the $11.4 billion in debt securities incurred during 2020 is included in Discontinued operations--net of tax. Following the Separation and Combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, we are no longer the obligor or guarantor of any Upjohn debt or Upjohn financing arrangements.\nAs a result of the spin-off of the Upjohn Business, we distributed net assets of $1.6 billion as of November 16, 2020, which was reflected as a reduction to Retained earnings and reflects the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. Of this amount, $412 million represents cash transferred to the Upjohn Business, with the remainder considered a non-cash activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. The spin-off also resulted in a net increase to Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $423 million for the derecognition of net gains on foreign currency translation adjustments of $397 million and prior service net credits associated with benefit plans of $26 million, which were reclassified to Retained earnings.\nAs a result of the separation of Upjohn, we incurred separation-related costs of $434 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019, which are included in Discontinued operations--net of tax. These costs primarily relate to professional fees for regulatory filings and separation activities within finance, tax, legal and information system functions as well as investment banking fees.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 65\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nIn connection with the Transactions, Pfizer and Viatris entered into various agreements to effect the Separation and Combination to provide a framework for our relationship after the Combination, including a separation and distribution agreement, interim operating models, including agency arrangements, MSAs, TSAs, a tax matters agreement, and an employee matters agreement, among others. The interim agency operating model arrangements primarily include billings, collections and remittance of rebates that we are performing on a transitional basis on behalf of Viatris. Under the MSAs, Pfizer or Viatris, as the case may be, manufactures, labels and packages products for the other party. The terms of the MSAs range in initial duration from four to seven years post-Separation. The TSAs primarily involve Pfizer providing services to Viatris related to finance, information technology and human resource infrastructure and are generally expected to be for terms of no more than three years post-Separation. The amounts recorded under the above agreements were not material to our consolidated results of operations in 2021 and 2020. In addition, Pfizer and Mylan had a pre-existing arms-length commercial agreement, which is continuing with Viatris and is not material to Pfizers consolidated financial statements.\nNet amounts due from Viatris under the above agreements were $53 million as of December 31, 2021 and $401 million as of December 31, 2020. The cash flows associated with the above agreements are included in Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, except for a $277 million payment to Viatris made in 2021 pursuant to terms of the separation agreement, which is reported in Other financing activities, net, and was recorded as a payable to Viatris in Other current liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nComponents of Discontinued operations--net of tax:\nYear Ended December 31,(a)\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues $ 277 $ 7,572 $ 10,845\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of sales 204 2,106 2,173\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 26 1,682 1,624\nResearch and development expenses 9 224 265\nAmortization of intangible assets 45 224 181\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs 2 29 146\nOther (income)/deductions--net 365 428 401\nPre-tax income/(loss) from discontinued operations (375) 2,879 6,056\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income (107) 349 738\nIncome/(loss) from discontinued operations--net of tax (268) 2,529 5,318\nPre-tax loss on sale of discontinued operations (211) - -\nBenefit for taxes on income (44) - -\nLoss on sale of discontinued operations--net of tax (167) - -\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax $ (434) $ 2,529 $ 5,318\n(a)In 2021, Discontinued operations-net of tax primarily includes (i) the operations of Meridian prior to its sale on December 31, 2021 recognized in Income/(loss) from discontinued operations-net of tax, which includes a pre-tax amount for a Multi-District Litigation relating to EpiPen against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas for $345 million; and (ii) the after tax loss of $167 million related to the sale of Meridian recognized in Loss on sale of discontinued operations--net of tax. To a much lesser extent, Discontinued operations-net of tax in 2021 also includes the operations of the Mylan-Japan collaboration prior to its termination on December 21, 2020 and post-closing adjustments directly related to our former Upjohn and Nutrition discontinued businesses, including adjustments for tax, benefits and legal-related matters recognized in Income/(loss) from discontinued operations-net of tax. In 2020 and 2019, Discontinued operations-net of tax relates to the operations of the Upjohn Business, Meridian and the Mylan-Japan collaboration and includes the change in accounting principle in the first quarter of 2021 to MTM Accounting. See Note 1C. In 2020, Discontinued operations-net of tax includes pre-tax interest expense of $116 million associated with the U.S. dollar and Euro denominated senior unsecured notes issued by Upjohn Inc. and Upjohn Finance B.V. in the second quarter of 2020 and pre-tax charges of $223 million related to the remeasurement of Euro debt issued by Upjohn Finance B.V. in the second quarter of 2020.\nComponents of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale:\nAs of December 31,(a)\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nCurrent assets of discontinued operations and other assets held for sale--Other current assets\n$ 25 $ 215\nProperty, plant and equipment $ - $ 155\nIdentifiable intangible assets - 134\nOther noncurrent assets - 29\nNoncurrent assets of discontinued operations--Other noncurrent assets\n$ - $ 319\nCurrent liabilities of discontinued operations--Other current liabilities\n$ - $ 74\nNoncurrent liabilities of discontinued operations--Other noncurrent liabilities\n$ - $ 16\n(a)Amounts as of December 31, 2021 represent property, plant and equipment held for sale.

Equity-Method Investments\nFormation of Consumer Healthcare JV\nOn July 31, 2019, we completed a transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new JV that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. In exchange, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. Upon closing, we deconsolidated our Consumer Healthcare business and recognized a pre-tax gain of $8.1 billion ($5.4 billion, net of tax) in the third quarter of 2019 in (Gain) on completion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction for the difference in the fair value of our 32% equity stake and the carrying value of our Consumer Healthcare business. Our financial results and our Consumer Healthcare segments operating results for 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations. The financial results for 2021 and 2020 do not reflect any contribution from the Consumer Healthcare business.\nIn valuing our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV, we used discounted cash flow techniques. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which include the expected impact of competitive, legal or regulatory forces on the products; the long-term growth rate, which seeks to project the sustainable growth rate over the long term; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect our best estimate of the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nWe are accounting for our interest in the Consumer Healthcare JV as an equity-method investment. The carrying value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV is $16.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $16.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and is reported as a private equity investment in Equity-method investments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The decrease in the value of our investment from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to dividends totaling $499 million, as well as $384 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6), partially offset by our share of the JVs earnings. We record our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net commencing from August 1, 2019. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first nine months of 2021, which we recorded in our operating results in 2021, was $495 million. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first nine months of 2020, which we recorded in our operating results in 2020, was $417 million. Our total share of two months of the JVs earnings generated in the third quarter of 2019, which we recorded in our operating results in the fourth quarter of 2019, was $47 million. As of the July 31, 2019 closing date, we estimated that the fair value of our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV was $15.7 billion and that 32% of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was $11.2 billion, resulting in an initial basis difference of approximately $4.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we preliminarily completed the allocation of the basis difference, which resulted from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV, primarily to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, related deferred tax liabilities and equity method goodwill within the investment account. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Consumer Healthcare JV revised the initial carrying value of the net assets of the JV and our 32% share of the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the Consumer Healthcare JV was reduced to $11.0 billion and our initial basis difference was increased to $4.8 billion. The adjustment was allocated to equity method goodwill within the investment account. We began recording the amortization of basis differences allocated to inventory, definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities in Other (income)/deductions--net commencing August 1, 2019. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of the JV is included in Other (income)/deductions--net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented. See Note 4. Amortization of basis differences on inventory and related deferred tax liabilities was completely recognized by the second quarter of 2020. Basis differences on definite-lived intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities are being amortized over the lives of the underlying assets, which range from 8 to 20 years.\nAs a part of Pfizer in 2019, pre-tax income on a management basis for the Consumer Healthcare business was $654 million through July 31, 2019.\nSummarized financial information for our equity method investee, the Consumer Healthcare JV, as of September 30, 2021, the most recent period available, and as of September 30, 2020 and for the periods ending September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n(MILLIONS) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020\nCurrent assets $ 6,890 $ 6,614\nNoncurrent assets 39,445 38,361\nTotal assets\n$ 46,335 $ 44,975\nCurrent liabilities $ 5,133 $ 5,246\nNoncurrent liabilities 5,218 5,330\nTotal liabilities\n$ 10,351 $ 10,576\nEquity attributable to shareholders $ 35,705 $ 34,154\nEquity attributable to noncontrolling interests 279 245\nTotal net equity $ 35,984 $ 34,400\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nFor the Twelve Months Ending For the Two Months Ending\n(MILLIONS) September 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 September 30, 2019\nNet sales $ 12,836 $ 12,720 $ 2,161\nCost of sales (4,755) (5,439) (803)\nGross profit $ 8,081 $ 7,281 $ 1,358\nIncome from continuing operations 1,614 1,350 152\nNet income 1,614 1,350 152\nIncome attributable to shareholders 1,547 1,307 148\nInvestment in ViiV\nIn 2009, we and GSK created ViiV, which is focused on research, development and commercialization of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medicines. We own approximately 11.7% of ViiV, and prior to 2016 we accounted for our investment under the equity method due to the significant influence that we have over the operations of ViiV through our board representation and minority veto rights. We suspended application of the equity method to our investment in ViiV in 2016 when the carrying value of our investment was reduced to zero due to the recognition of cumulative equity method losses and dividends. Since 2016, we have recognized dividends from ViiV as income in Other (income)/deductions--net when earned, including dividends of $166 million in 2021, $278 million in 2020 and $220 million in 2019 (see Note 4).\nSummarized financial information for our equity method investee, ViiV, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nCurrent assets $ 3,608 $ 3,283\nNoncurrent assets 3,563 3,381\nTotal assets\n$ 7,171 $ 6,664\nCurrent liabilities $ 3,497 $ 3,028\nNoncurrent liabilities 6,536 6,370\nTotal liabilities\n$ 10,033 $ 9,398\nTotal net equity/(deficit) attributable to shareholders $ (2,862) $ (2,734)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nNet sales $ 6,380 $ 6,224 $ 6,139\nCost of sales (682) (574) (516)\nGross profit $ 5,698 $ 5,650 $ 5,623\nIncome from continuing operations 2,040 2,012 3,398\nNet income 2,040 2,012 3,398\nIncome attributable to shareholders 2,040 2,012 3,398\nD. Licensing Arrangements\nAgreement with Valneva\nOn April 30, 2020, we signed an agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valnevas Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, which covers six serotypes that are prevalent in North America and Europe. Valneva and Pfizer will work closely together throughout the development of VLA15. Valneva is eligible to receive a total of up to $308 million in cash payments from us consisting of a $130 million upfront payment, which was paid and recorded in Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020, as well as $35 million in development milestones and $143 million in early commercialization milestones. Under the terms of the agreement, Valneva will fund 30% of all development costs through completion of the development program, and in return we will pay Valneva tiered royalties. We will lead late-stage development and have sole control over commercialization.\nAgreement with Akcea\nOn October 4, 2019, we entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement for AKCEA-ANGPTL3-LRx, an investigational antisense therapy being developed to treat patients with certain cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, with Akcea, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ionis. The transaction closed in November 2019 and we made an upfront payment of $250 million to Akcea, which was recorded in Research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2019. On January 31, 2022, we and Ionis announced the discontinuation of the Pfizer-led clinical development program for the licensed product and that we would be returning the rights to the licensed product to Ionis.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nE. Collaborative Arrangements\nWe enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to in-line medicines, as well as medicines in development that require completion of research and regulatory approval. Collaborative arrangements are contractual agreements with third parties that involve a joint operating activity, typically a research and/or commercialization effort, where both we and our partner are active participants in the activity and are exposed to the significant risks and rewards of the activity. Our rights and obligations under our collaborative arrangements vary. For example, we have agreements to co-promote pharmaceutical products discovered by us or other companies, and we have agreements where we partner to co-develop and/or participate together in commercializing, marketing, promoting, manufacturing and/or distributing a drug product.\nCollaboration with Beam\nOn December 24, 2021, we entered into a multi-year research collaboration with Beam to utilize Beams in vivo base editing programs, which use mRNA and lipid nanoparticles, for three targets for rare genetic diseases of the liver, muscle and central nervous system. Under the terms of the agreement, Beam conducts all research activities through development candidate selection for three undisclosed targets, which are not included in Beams existing programs, and we may opt in to obtain exclusive licenses to each development candidate. Beam has a right to opt in, at the end of phase 1/2 studies, upon the payment by Beam of an option exercise fee, to a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with respect to one program licensed under the collaboration pursuant to which we and Beam would share net profits as well as development and commercialization costs in a 65%/35% ratio (Pfizer/Beam). Upon entering into the agreement, we recorded $300 million in Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021 for an upfront payment due to Beam, and if we exercise our opt in to licenses for all three targets, Beam would be eligible for up to an additional $1.05 billion in development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for a potential total deal consideration of up to $1.35 billion. Beam is also eligible to receive royalties on global net sales for each licensed program.\nCollaboration with Arvinas\nOn July 21, 2021, we entered into a global collaboration with Arvinas to develop and commercialize ARV-471, an investigational oral PROTAC\u00ae (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera) estrogen receptor protein degrader. The estrogen receptor is a well-known disease driver in most breast cancers. In connection with the agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $650 million to Arvinas and we made a $350 million equity investment in the common stock of Arvinas. We recognized $706 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on our equity investment in Research and development expenses in our third quarter of 2021. Arvinas is also eligible to receive up to $400 million in approval milestones and up to $1 billion in commercial milestones. The companies will equally share worldwide development costs, commercialization expenses and profits. As of December 31, 2021, we held a 6.5% equity stake of Arvinas.\nCollaboration with Myovant\nOn December 26, 2020, we entered into a collaboration with Myovant to jointly develop and commercialize Orgovyx (relugolix) in advanced prostate cancer and Myfembree (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in womens health in the U.S. and Canada. We also received an exclusive option to commercialize relugolix in oncology outside the U.S. and Canada, excluding certain Asian countries, which we declined to exercise. Under the terms of the agreement, the companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses for Orgovyx and Myfembree in the U.S. and Canada, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in 2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. We record our share of gross profits as Alliance revenue. Myovant remains responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continues to lead clinical development for Myfembree. Myovant is entitled to receive up to $4.35 billion, including an upfront payment of $650 million, which was made in December 2020, $200 million in potential regulatory milestones for FDA approvals for Myfembree in womens health, of which $100 million was paid to Myovant in July 2021 and recognized as Identifiable intangible assets-Developed technology rights, and tiered sales milestones of up to $3.5 billion in total for prostate cancer and for the combined womens health indications. In connection with this transaction, in 2020 we recognized $499 million in Identifiable intangible assets--Developed technology rights and $151 million in Research and development expenses representing the relative fair value of the portion of the upfront payment allocated to the approved indication and unapproved indications of the product, respectively.\nCollaboration with CStone\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into a strategic collaboration with CStone to address oncological needs in China. The collaboration encompasses our $200 million upfront equity investment in CStone, the development and commercialization of CStones sugemalimab (CS1001, PD-L1 antibody) in mainland China, and a framework between the companies to bring additional oncology assets to the Greater China market. The transaction closed on October 9, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we held a 9.8% equity stake of CStone.\nCollaborations with BioNTech\nOn December 30, 2021, we entered into a new research, development and commercialization agreement to develop a potential first mRNA-based vaccine for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster virus) based on BioNTechs proprietary mRNA technology and our antigen technology. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay BioNTech $225 million, including an upfront cash payment of $75 million and an equity investment of $150 million. BioNTech is eligible to receive future regulatory and sales milestone payments of up to $200 million. In return, BioNTech agreed to pay us $25 million for our proprietary antigen technology. The net upfront payment to BioNTech was recorded to Research and development expenses in our fourth quarter of 2021. We and BioNTech will share development costs. We will have commercialization rights to the potential vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany, Turkey and certain developing countries where BioNTech will have commercialization rights. We and BioNTech will share gross profits from commercialization of any product.\nOn April 9, 2020, we signed a global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162b2, aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection. In connection with the April 2020 agreement, we made an upfront cash payment of $72 million and an equity investment in the common stock of BioNTech of $113 million. We recognized $98 million for the upfront payment and a premium paid on the equity investment in Research and development expenses in our second quarter of 2020. BioNTech became eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to $563 million for a total consideration of $748 million. Under the terms of this agreement, we and BioNTech share gross profits and development costs equally after approval and successful commercialization of the vaccine, and we were responsible for all of\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nthe development costs until commercialization of the vaccine. Thereafter, BioNTech was to repay us its 50 percent share of these development costs through reductions in gross profit sharing and milestone payments to BioNTech over time. On January 29, 2021, we and BioNTech signed an amended version of the April 2020 agreement. Under the January 2021 agreement, BioNTech paid us their 50 percent share of prior development costs in a lump sum payment during the first quarter of 2021. Further R&D costs are being shared equally. We have commercialization rights to the vaccine worldwide, excluding Germany and Turkey where BioNTech markets and distributes the vaccine under the agreement with us, and excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, which are subject to a separate collaboration between BioNTech and Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., Ltd. We recognize Revenues and Cost of sales on a gross basis in markets where we are commercializing the vaccine and we record our share of gross profits related to sales of the vaccine by BioNTech in Germany and Turkey in Alliance revenues.\nWe made an additional investment of $50 million in common stock of BioNTech as part of an underwritten equity offering by BioNTech, which closed in July 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we held an equity stake of 2.5% of BioNTech.\nSummarized Financial Information for Collaborative Arrangements\nThe following provides the amounts and classification of payments (income/(expense)) between us and our collaboration partners:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRevenues-Revenues(a)\n$ 590 $ 284 $ 305\nRevenues-Alliance revenues(b)\n7,652 5,418 4,648\nTotal revenues from collaborative arrangements $ 8,241 $ 5,703 $ 4,953\nCost of sales(c)\n$ (16,169) $ (61) $ (52)\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses(d)\n(175) (194) (176)\nResearch and development expenses(e)\n(742) (192) 104\nOther income/(deductions)-net(f)\n820 567 362\n(a)Represents sales to our partners of products manufactured by us.\n(b)Substantially all relates to amounts earned from our partners under co-promotion agreements.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nIn 2019, we substantially completed several multi-year initiatives focused on positioning us for future growth and creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business.\nA. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program\nWith the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer has transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines. We have undertaken efforts to ensure our cost base and support model align appropriately with our new operating structure. While certain direct costs transferred to the Consumer Healthcare JV and to the Upjohn Business in connection with the spin-off, there are indirect costs which did not transfer. This program is primarily composed of the following three initiatives:\nWe are taking steps to restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our business, R&D and PGS platform functions. We expect costs, primarily related to restructuring our corporate enabling functions, to total $1.6 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs will primarily include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.\nIn addition, we are transforming our commercial go-to market model in the way we engage patients and physicians. We expect costs of $1.1 billion, with substantially all costs to be cash expenditures. Actions include, among others, centralization of certain activities and enhanced use of digital technologies. The costs for this effort primarily include severance and associated implementation costs.\nWe are also optimizing our manufacturing network under this program and incurring one-time costs for cost-reduction initiatives related to our manufacturing operations. We expect to incur costs of $800 million, with approximately 25% of the costs to be non-cash. The costs for this effort include, among other things, severance costs, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, as well as accelerated depreciation.\nThe program costs discussed above are expected to be incurred primarily from 2020 through 2022, and may be rounded and represent approximations.\nFrom the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through December 31, 2021, we incurred costs of $2.2 billion, of which $856 million is associated with Biopharma ($712 million in 2021, $79 million in 2020 and $64 million in 2019).\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 70\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nB. Key Activities\nIn 2021 and 2020, we incurred costs of $1.3 billion and $838 million, respectively, composed primarily of the Transforming to a More Focused Company program. In 2019, we incurred costs of $820 million composed of $548 million for the 2017-2019 and Organizing for Growth initiatives, $288 million for the integration of Array, $94 million for the integration of Hospira, and $87 million for the Transforming to a More Focused Company program, partially offset by income of $197 million, primarily due to the reversal of certain accruals upon the effective favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years and other acquisition-related initiatives.\nThe following summarizes acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives costs and credits:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nRestructuring charges/(credits):\nEmployee terminations $ 680 $ 474 $ 108\nAsset impairments 53 66 69\nExit costs/(credits) 8 (6) 50\nRestructuring charges/(credits)(a)\n741 535 227\nTransaction costs(b)\n20 10 63\nIntegration costs and other(c)\n41 34 311\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs\n802 579 601\nNet periodic benefit costs/(credits) recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net(d)\n(63) 3 23\nAdditional depreciation--asset restructuring recorded in our consolidated statements of income as follows(e):\nCost of sales 63 21 29\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 23 - 3\nResearch and development expenses - (3) 8\nTotal additional depreciation--asset restructuring\n87 17 40\nImplementation costs recorded in our consolidated statements of income as follows(f):\nCost of sales 45 40 61\nSelling, informational and administrative expenses 426 197 73\nResearch and development expenses 1 1 22\nTotal implementation costs\n472 238 156\nTotal costs associated with acquisitions and cost-reduction/productivity initiatives $ 1,298 $ 838 $ 820\n(a)Represents acquisition-related costs ($9 million credit in 2021 and $192 million credit in 2019) and cost reduction initiatives ($750 million charge in 2021, $535 million charge in 2020, and $418 million charge in 2019). 2021 and 2020 charges mainly represent employee termination costs for our Transforming to a More Focused Company cost-reduction program. 2019 restructuring charges mainly represent employee termination costs for cost-reduction and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the reversal of certain accruals related to our acquisition of Wyeth upon the effective favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years (see Note 5B). The employee termination costs for 2019 were primarily for our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our business structure, and also included employee termination costs for the Transforming to a More Focused Company cost-reduction program.\n(b)Represents external costs for banking, legal, accounting and other similar services.\n(c)Represents external, incremental costs directly related to integrating acquired businesses, such as expenditures for consulting and the integration of systems and processes, and certain other qualifying costs. 2021 costs primarily related to our acquisition of Trillium. 2020 costs primarily related to our acquisition of Array. 2019 costs mainly related to our acquisitions of Array, including $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options that was recognized as post-closing compensation expense (see Note 2A), and Hospira.\n(d)Amounts include the impact of a change in accounting principle.

Tax Matters\nA. Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations\nComponents of Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income include:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 6,064 $ (2,887) $ 7,332\nInternational 18,247 9,924 3,988\nIncome from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income(a), (b)\n$ 24,311 $ 7,036 $ 11,321\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 72\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n(a)2021 v. 2020--The domestic income in 2021 versus domestic loss in 2020 was mainly related to Comirnaty income, lower asset impairment charges, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and higher net gains from equity securities, partially offset by higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to Comirnaty income, net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020 and lower asset impairment charges.\n(b)2020 v. 2019--The domestic loss in 2020 versus domestic income in 2019 was mainly related to the non-recurrence of the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction as well as higher asset impairment charges and higher R&D expenses. The increase in the international income was primarily related to the non-recurrence of the write off of assets contributed to the Consumer Healthcare JV as well as lower asset impairment charges and lower amortization of intangible assets.\nComponents of Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income based on the location of the taxing authorities include:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States\nCurrent income taxes:\nFederal\n$ 3,342 $ 372 $ (1,887)\nState and local\n34 56 (186)\nDeferred income taxes:\nFederal\n(3,850) (1,164) 1,254\nState and local\n(491) (131) 276\nTotal U.S. tax benefit\n(964) (867) (543)\nTCJA\nCurrent income taxes\n- - (135)\nDeferred Income taxes\n- - (187)\nTotal TCJA tax benefit\n- - (323)\nInternational\nCurrent income taxes\n2,769 1,517 2,418\nDeferred income taxes\n48 (279) (969)\nTotal international tax provision\n2,816 1,237 1,449\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income\n$ 1,852 $ 370 $ 583\nAmounts discussed below are rounded to the nearest hundred million and represent approximations.\nWe elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The third annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 15, 2021 due date. The fourth annual installment is due April 18, 2022 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of December 31, 2021. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.\nThe changes in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below:\n2021 v. 2020\nThe higher effective tax rate in 2021 was mainly the result of:\nthe change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings primarily related to Comirnaty; and\nlower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,\npartially offset by:\ncertain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK based on estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable.\n2020 v. 2019\nThe higher effective tax rate in 2020 was mainly the result of:\nthe non-recurrence of the $1.4 billion tax benefits, representing taxes and interest, recorded in 2019 due to the favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years;\nthe non-recurrence of the tax benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our then new business structure; and\nthe non-recurrence of the tax benefits recorded in 2019 as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the TCJA, as well as:\nlower tax benefits related to the impairment of intangible assets,\npartially offset by:\nthe non-recurrence of the tax expense of $2.7 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2019 associated with the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction; and\nthe favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.\nIn all years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income (see Note 2A).\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 73\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nB. Tax Rate Reconciliation\nThe reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for Income from continuing operations follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nU.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nTCJA impact(a)\n- - (2.9)\nTaxation of non-U.S. operations (b), (c)\n(4.3) (9.9) (4.7)\nTax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions(a)\n(0.4) (2.7) (14.0)\nCompletion of Consumer Healthcare JV transaction(a)\n- - 8.3\nCertain Consumer Healthcare JV initiatives(a)\n(6.0) - -\nU.S. R&D tax credit (0.5) (1.4) (0.8)\nInterest(d)\n0.4 1.1 0.6\nAll other, net(e)\n(2.6) (2.8) (2.3)\nEffective tax rate for income from continuing operations\n7.6 % 5.3 % 5.2 %\n(a)See Note 5A.\n(b)For taxation of non-U.S. operations, this rate impact reflects the income tax rates and relative earnings in the locations where we do business outside the U.S., together with the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions, as well as changes in valuation allowances. Specifically: (i) the jurisdictional location of earnings is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year, and the rate impact of this component is influenced by the specific location of non-U.S. earnings and the level of such earnings as compared to our total earnings; (ii) the U.S. tax implications of our foreign operations is a significant component of our effective tax rate each year and generally offsets some of the reduction to our effective tax rate each year resulting from the jurisdictional location of earnings; (iii) the impact of certain tax initiatives; and (iv) the impact of changes in uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions is a component of our effective tax rate each year that can result in either an increase or decrease to our effective tax rate. The jurisdictional mix of earnings, which includes the impact of the location of earnings as well as the U.S. tax cost on our international operations, can vary as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business and as a result of the extent and location of other income and expense items, such as restructuring charges, asset impairments and gains and losses on strategic business decisions. See also Note 5A for the components of pre-tax income and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, which is based on the location of the taxing authorities, and for information about settlements and other items impacting Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.\n(c)In all years, the reduction in our effective tax rate is a result of the jurisdictional location of earnings and is largely due to lower tax rates in certain jurisdictions, as well as manufacturing and other incentives for our subsidiaries in Singapore and, to a lesser extent, in Puerto Rico. We benefit from Puerto Rican tax incentives pursuant to a grant that expires during 2029. Under such grant, we are partially exempt from income, property and municipal taxes. In Singapore, we benefit from incentive tax rates effective through 2047 on income from manufacturing and other operations.\n(d)Includes changes in interest related to our uncertain tax positions not included in the reconciling item called Tax settlements and resolution of certain tax positions.\n(e)All other, net is primarily due to routine business operations.\nC.

See Note 1Q.\n(a)The increase in net deferred tax assets in 2021 is primarily related to temporary differences associated with Comirnaty royalty accruals and the result of operating lease ROU liabilities recognized during the period.\n(b)The increase in the deferred tax assets is primarily due to the acquisition of intangible assets relating to Trillium and the decrease in the 2021 deferred tax liabilities is primarily the result of amortization of intangible assets.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n(c)The increase in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily the result of operating lease ROU assets recognized during the period. See Note 15.\n(d)The decrease in net deferred tax assets in 2021 is primarily the result of favorable pension plan asset performance reported in the period. See Note 11A.\n(e)The amounts in 2021 and 2020 are reduced for unrecognized tax benefits of $3.0 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, where we have net operating loss carryforwards, similar tax losses, and/or tax credit carryforwards that are available, under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position.\n(f)The decrease in net deferred tax liabilities in 2021 is primarily due to certain initiatives executed in the third quarter of 2021 associated with our investment in the Consumer Healthcare JV.\n(g)In 2021, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.6 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($0.3 billion). In 2020, Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($0.9 billion), and Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($4.1 billion).\nWe have carryforwards, primarily related to net operating and capital losses, general business credits, foreign tax credits and charitable contributions, which are available to reduce future U.S. federal and/or state, as well as international, income taxes payable with either an indefinite life or expiring at various times from 2022 to 2041. Certain of our U.S. net operating losses and general business credits are subject to limitations under IRC Section 382.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not made a U.S. tax provision on $55.0 billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries. As these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, the determination of a hypothetical unrecognized deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2021 is not practicable. The amount of indefinitely reinvested earnings is based on estimates and assumptions and subject to management evaluation, and is subject to change in the normal course of business based on operational cash flow, completion of local statutory financial statements and the finalization of tax returns and audits, among other things. Accordingly, we regularly update our earnings and profits analysis for such events.\nD. Tax Contingencies\nFor a description of our accounting policies associated with accounting for income tax contingencies, see Note 1Q.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of our tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, we had $4.5 billion and as of December 31, 2020, we had $4.3 billion in net unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest.\nTax assets for uncertain tax positions primarily represent our estimate of the potential tax benefits in one tax jurisdiction that could result from the payment of income taxes in another tax jurisdiction. These potential benefits generally result from cooperative efforts among taxing authorities, as required by tax treaties to minimize double taxation, commonly referred to as the competent authority process. The recoverability of these assets, which we believe to be more likely than not, is dependent upon the actual payment of taxes in one tax jurisdiction and, in some cases, the successful petition for recovery in another tax jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.5 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.4 billion) and Other taxes payable ($105 million). As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion in assets associated with uncertain tax positions. These amounts were included in Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($1.1 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($122 million) and Other taxes payable ($46 million).\nSubstantially all of these unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective income tax rate.\nThe reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nBalance, beginning $ (5,595) $ (5,381) $ (6,259)\nAcquisitions - 37 (44)\nDivestitures(a)\n- 265 -\nIncreases based on tax positions taken during a prior period(b)\n(111) (232) (36)\nDecreases based on tax positions taken during a prior period(b), (c)\n103 64 1,109\nDecreases based on settlements for a prior period(d)\n24 15 100\nIncreases based on tax positions taken during the current period(b)\n(550) (411) (383)\nImpact of foreign exchange 22 (72) 25\nOther, net(b), (e)\n40 120 107\nBalance, ending(f)\n$ (6,068) $ (5,595) $ (5,381)\n(a)For 2020, related to the separation of Upjohn. See Note 2B.\n(b)Primarily included in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.\n(c)Primarily related to effectively settling certain issues with the U.S. and foreign tax authorities. See Note 5A.\n(d)Primarily related to cash payments and reductions of tax attributes.\n(e)Primarily related to decreases as a result of a lapse of applicable statutes of limitations.\n(f)In 2021, included in Income taxes payable ($19 million), Other current assets ($42 million) Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($3.0 billion), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($5 million) and Other taxes payable ($3.0 billion). In 2020, included in Income taxes payable ($34 million), Noncurrent deferred tax assets and other noncurrent tax assets ($18 million), Noncurrent deferred tax liabilities ($3.0 billion) and Other taxes payable ($2.5 billion).\nInterest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded net increases in interest of $108 million and $89 million, respectively. In 2019, we recorded a net decrease in interest of $564 million, resulting primarily from a settlement with the IRS. Gross accrued interest totaled $601 million as of December 31, 2021 (reflecting a decrease of $1 million as a result of cash payments) and gross\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 75\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\naccrued interest totaled $493 million as of December 31, 2020 (reflecting a decrease of $5 million as a result of cash payments and a decrease of $75 million relating to the separation of Upjohn). In 2021 and 2020, these amounts were substantially all included in Other taxes payable. Accrued penalties are not significant. See also Note 5A.\nStatus of Tax Audits and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions\nThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, the IRS has issued Revenue Agents Reports (RARs) for tax years 2011-2013 and 2014-2015. We are not in agreement with the RARs and are currently appealing certain disputed issues. Tax years 2016-2018 are currently under audit. Tax years 2019-2021 are open, but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years in certain major international tax jurisdictions such as Canada (2013-2021), Europe (2011-2021, primarily reflecting Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2011-2021, primarily reflecting China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2021, primarily reflecting Brazil).\nAny settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $75 million, as a result of settlements with taxing authorities or the expiration of the statutes of limitations. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire, as we treat these events as discrete items in the period of resolution. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible changes related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.\nE.

We recorded a net loss of $138 million in Other (income)/deductions--net, which included the related termination of cross currency swaps.\nE. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nForeign Exchange Risk\nA significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.\nThe derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.\nWe hedge a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales denominated in euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, U.K. pound and Australian dollar for up to two years.\nUnder certain market conditions, we may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.\nChanges in fair value are reported in earnings or in Other comprehensive income/(loss), depending on the nature and purpose of the financial instrument (hedge or offset relationship). For certain foreign exchange contracts, we exclude an amount from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the excluded amount through an amortization approach in earnings. The hedge relationships are as follows:\nGenerally, we recognize the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings upon the recognition of the change in fair value of the hedged item. We also recognize the offsetting foreign exchange impact attributable to the hedged item in earnings.\nGenerally, we record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) gains or losses on foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges and reclassify those amounts into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nWe record in Other comprehensive income/(loss) --Foreign currency translation adjustments, net the foreign exchange gains and losses related to foreign exchange-denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts designated as a hedge of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and reclassify those amounts into earnings upon the sale or substantial liquidation of our net investments.\nFor foreign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments, we recognize the gains and losses immediately into earnings along with the earnings impact of the items they generally offset. These contracts take the opposite currency position of that reflected on the balance sheet to counterbalance the effect of any currency movement.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.\nWe recognize the change in fair value on interest rate contracts that are designated as fair value hedges in earnings, as well as the offsetting earnings impact of the hedged risk attributable to the hedged item.\nThe following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts (including those reported as part of discontinued operations):\n(MILLIONS) As of December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2020\nFair Value Fair Value\nNotional Asset Liability Notional Asset Liability\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts(a)\n$ 29,576 $ 787 $ 717 $ 24,369 $ 145 $ 1,005\nInterest rate contracts\n2,250 21 - 1,950 135 -\n808 717 280 1,005\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$ 21,419 160 164 $ 15,063 94 95\nTotal $ 968 $ 881 $ 373 $ 1,100\n(a)The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts hedging our intercompany forecasted inventory sales was $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 80\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe following summarizes information about the gains/(losses) incurred to hedge or offset operational foreign exchange or interest rate risk exposures (including those reported as part of discontinued operations):\nGains/(Losses)\nRecognized in OID(a)\nGains/(Losses)\nRecognized in OCI(a)\nGains/(Losses)\nReclassified from\nOCI into OID and COS(a)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Cash Flow Hedge Relationships:\nForeign exchange contracts(b)\n$ - $ - $ 488 $ (649) $ (173) $ (77)\nAmount excluded from effectiveness testing and amortized into earnings(c)\n- - 38 55 38 57\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Fair Value Hedge Relationships:\nInterest rate contracts\n(7) 369 - - - -\nHedged item\n7 (369) - - - -\nDerivative Financial Instruments in Net Investment Hedge Relationships:\nForeign exchange contracts - - 468 (501) - -\nAmount excluded from effectiveness testing and amortized into earnings(c)\n- - 52 181 109 154\nNon-Derivative Financial Instruments in Net Investment Hedge Relationships:(d)\nForeign currency short-term borrowings - - 78 8 - -\nForeign currency long-term debt - - 86 (183) - -\nDerivative Financial Instruments Not Designated as Hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts (192) 178 - - - -\nAll other net(c)\n- - 1 12 1 (1)\n$ (192) $ 178 $ 1,210 $ (1,077) $ (25) $ 133\n(a)OID = Other (income)/deductions-net, included in Other (income)/deductions-net in the consolidated statements of income. COS = Cost of Sales, included in Cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. OCI = Other comprehensive income/(loss), included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(b)The amounts reclassified from OCI into COS were:\na net loss of $89 million in 2021; and\na net gain of $172 million in 2020 (including a gain of $22 million reported in Discontinued operations--net of tax).\nThe remaining amounts were reclassified from OCI into OID. Based on year-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax gain of $362 million within the next 12 months into income. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future foreign exchange cash flows is approximately 21 years and relates to foreign currency debt.\n(c)The amounts reclassified from OCI were reclassified into OID.\n(d)Short-term borrowings and long-term debt include foreign currency borrowings which are used as net investment hedges. The short-term borrowings carrying value as of December 31, 2021 was $1.1 billion. The long-term debt carrying values as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $844 million and $2.1 billion, respectively.\nThe following summarizes cumulative basis adjustments to our long-term debt in fair value hedges:\nAs of December 31, 2021 As of December 31, 2020\nCumulative Amount of Fair\nValue Hedging Adjustment\nIncrease/(Decrease) to\nCarrying Amount Cumulative Amount of Fair\nValue Hedging Adjustment Increase/(Decrease) to\nCarrying Amount\n(MILLIONS) Carrying Amount of Hedged Assets/Liabilities(a)\nActive\nHedging\nRelationships Discontinued Hedging Relationships Carrying Amount of Hedged Assets/Liabilities(a)\nActive Hedging Relationships Discontinued Hedging Relationships\nLong-term debt $ 2,233 $ 16 $ 1,154 $ 2,016 $ 117 $ 1,149\n(a)Carrying amounts exclude the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments.\nF. Credit Risk\nOn an ongoing basis, we monitor and review the credit risk of our customers, financial institutions and exposures in our investment portfolio.\nWith respect to our trade accounts receivable, we monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit in the normal course of business. In general, there is no requirement for collateral from customers. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable and\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 81\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nallowance for credit losses, see Note 1H. A significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 17C.\nWith respect to our investments, we monitor concentrations of credit risk associated with government, government agency, and corporate issuers of securities. Investments are placed in instruments that are investment grade and are primarily short in duration. Exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single credit counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio represent primarily sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Canada, Japan, U.K., Germany, France, Australia, and Switzerland.\nWith respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $372 million, for which we have posted collateral of $382 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $477 million, for which we have received collateral of $581 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.\nNote 8.

We possess a well-diversified portfolio of hundreds of developed technology rights across therapeutic categories, representing our commercialized products. The significant components of developed technology rights are the following: Xtandi, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Infant, Braftovi/Mektovi, Premarin, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 Adult, Eucrisa, Orgovyx, Zavicefta, Tygacil, Bavencio, Merrem/Meronem and Comirnaty. Also included in this category are the post-approval milestone payments made under our alliance agreements for certain prescription pharmaceutical products.\nBrands\nBrands represent the cost for tradenames and know-how, as the products themselves do not receive patent protection. Indefinite-lived brands include Medrol and Depo-Medrol, while finite-lived brands include Zavedos and Depo-Provera.\nIPR&D\nIPR&D assets represent R&D assets that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. The significant components of IPR&D are the following: the program for the oral poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with germline BRCA-mutated advanced breast cancer acquired as part of the Medivation acquisition and assets acquired in connection with the Array acquisition. IPR&D assets are required to be classified as indefinite-lived assets until the successful completion or the abandonment of the associated R&D effort. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, these assets are not amortized until approval is obtained in a major market, typically either the U.S. or the EU, or in a series of other countries, subject to certain specified conditions and management judgment. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify it out of IPR&D and begin amortization. If the associated R&D effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\nIPR&D assets are high-risk assets, given the uncertain nature of R&D. Accordingly, we expect that many of these IPR&D assets will become impaired and be written-off at some time in the future.\nLicensing Agreements\nLicensing agreements for developed technology and for technology in development primarily relate to out-licensing arrangements acquired from third parties, including the Array acquisition. These assets represent the cost for the license, where we acquired the right to future royalties and/or milestones upon development or commercialization by the licensing partner. A significant component of the licensing arrangements are for out-licensing arrangements with a number of partners for oncology technology in varying stages of development that have not yet received regulatory approval in a major market. Accordingly, during the development period after the date of acquisition, each of these assets is classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and will not be amortized until approval is obtained in a major market. At that time we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the respective licensing arrangement asset to finite-lived intangible asset and begin amortization. If the development effort is abandoned, the related licensing asset will likely be written-off, and we will record an impairment charge.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 83\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAmortization\nThe weighted-average life for each of our total finite-lived intangible assets is approximately 8 years, and for the largest component, developed technology rights, is approximately 7 years. Total amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $3.7 billion in 2021, $3.4 billion in 2020 and $4.5 billion in 2019.\nThe following provides the expected annual amortization expense:\n(MILLIONS) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\nAmortization expense $ 3,279 $ 2,936 $ 2,686 $ 2,500 $ 2,449\nB. Goodwill\nThe following summarizes the components and changes in the carrying amount of Goodwill:\n(MILLIONS) Total(a)\nBalance, January 1, 2020\n$ 48,181\nAdditions(b)\nOther(c)\nBalance, December 31, 2020\n49,556\nAdditions -\nOther(c)\n(348)\nBalance, December 31, 2021\n$ 49,208\n(a)As a result of the reorganization of our commercial operations during the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 17), we were required to estimate the relative fair values of our PC1 and Hospital organizations to determine any reallocation of goodwill. We completed this analysis and determined that no goodwill was required to be reallocated. As a result, our entire goodwill balance continues to be assigned within the Biopharma reportable segment.\n(b)Additions primarily represent the impact of measurement period adjustments related to our Array acquisition (see Note 2A).\n(c)Other represents the impact of foreign exchange.\nNote 11. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans\nThe majority of our employees worldwide are eligible for retirement benefits provided through defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. A qualified plan meets the requirements of certain sections of the IRC, and, generally, contributions to qualified plans are tax deductible. A qualified plan typically provides benefits to a broad group of employees with restrictions on discriminating in favor of highly compensated employees with regard to coverage, benefits and contributions. A supplemental (non-qualified) plan provides additional benefits to certain employees. In addition, we provide medical insurance benefits to certain retirees and their eligible dependents through our postretirement plans.\nAs discussed in Note 1C, we adopted a change in accounting principle to a more preferable policy under U.S. GAAP to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of pension and postretirement plans. This change has been applied to all pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis for all prior periods presented.\nA. Components of Net Periodic Benefit Costs and Changes in Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nThe following summarizes the components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit), including those reported as part of discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019, and the changes in Other comprehensive income/(loss) for our benefit plans:\nPension Plans Postretirement Plans\nU.S. International\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nService cost $ - $ - $ - $ 130 $ 146 $ 125 $ 36 $ 38 $ 37\nInterest cost 455 533 676 146 164 215 29 49 75\nExpected return on plan assets\n(1,052) (1,015) (890) (327) (314) (318) (39) (36) (33)\nAmortization of prior service cost/(credit) (2) (3) (4) (1) (3) (4) (151) (170) (173)\nActuarial (gains)/losses(a)\n(684) 1,152 284 (690) 148 669 (167) (165) (118)\nCurtailments - - (4) (4) - (1) (82) - (62)\nSpecial termination benefits\n17 1 20 - - - 2 - 2\nNet periodic benefit cost/(credit) reported in income (1,265) 668 82 (746) 141 686 (372) (282) (271)\nCost/(credit) reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n2 5 4 4 5 21 107 114 164\nCost/(credit) recognized in Comprehensive income\n$ (1,264) $ 674 $ 86 $ (742) $ 145 $ 707 $ (265) $ (168) $ (107)\n(a)Reflects actuarial remeasurement gains in 2021, primarily due to favorable plan asset performance and increases in discount rates, and actuarial remeasurement losses in 2020 and 2019, primarily due to decreases in discount rates partially offset by favorable plan asset performance.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 84\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit) other than the service cost component are included in Other (income)/deductions--net (see Note 4).\nB.

We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\nThe weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2021 resulted in higher discount rates as compared to the prior year.\nThe following provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:\nAs of December 31,\n2021 2020\nHealthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 6.0 % 5.6 %\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline 4.0 % 4.5 %\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2045 2037\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 85\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nC.

Level 2 investments may include short-term investment funds which are commingled funds priced at a stable NAV by the administrator of the funds.\nEquity securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 1 and Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on quoted prices on an exchange or a published NAV derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Level 3 investments may include individual securities that are unlisted, delisted, suspended, or illiquid and are typically valued using their last available price.\nFixed income securities: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include commingled funds that have a readily determinable fair value based on observable prices of the underlying securities. Level 2 investments may include corporate bonds, government and government agency obligations and other fixed income securities valued using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Level 3 investments may include securities that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.\nOther investments: Level 1 investments may include individual securities that are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which they are traded. Level 2 investments may include Insurance contracts which invest in interest bearing cash, U.S. government securities and corporate debt instruments. Level 3 investments may include securities or insurance contracts that are valued using alternative pricing sources, such as investment managers or brokers, which use proprietary pricing models that incorporate unobservable inputs.\nEquity securities, Fixed income securities and Other investments may each be combined into commingled funds. Most commingled funds are valued to reflect the interest in the fund based on the reported year-end NAV. Partnership and Other investments are valued based on year-end reported NAV (or its equivalent), with adjustments as appropriate for lagged reporting of up to three months.\nCertain investments are authorized to include derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards for managing risks and exposures.\nGlobal plan assets are managed with the objective of generating returns that will enable the plans to meet their future obligations, while seeking to manage net periodic benefit costs and cash contributions over the long-term. We utilize long-term asset allocation ranges in the management of our plans invested assets. Our long-term return expectations are developed based on a diversified, global investment strategy that takes into account historical experience, as well as the impact of portfolio diversification, active portfolio management, and our view of current and future economic and financial market conditions. As market conditions and other factors change, we may adjust our targets accordingly and our asset allocations may vary from the target allocations.\nE. Cash Flows\nIt is our practice to fund amounts for our qualified pension plans that are at least sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local tax laws.\nThe following provides the expected future cash flow information related to our benefit plans:\nPension Plans Postretirement Plans\n(MILLIONS) U.S. International\nExpected employer contributions:\n2022 $ 138 $ 177 $ 74\nExpected benefit payments:\n2022 $ 1,296 $ 384 $ 78\n2023 1,155 372 73\n2024 1,140 383 69\n2025 1,089 392 66\n2026 1,058 397 68\n2027-2031 4,908 2,124 359\nThe above table reflects the total U.S. and international plan benefits projected to be paid from the plans or from our general assets under the current actuarial assumptions used for the calculation of the benefit obligation.\nF. Defined Contribution Plans\nWe have defined contribution plans in the U.S. and other countries. For the majority of the U.S. defined contribution plans, employees may contribute a portion of their salaries and bonuses to the plans, and we match, in cash, a portion of the employee contributions. We also offer a Retirement Savings Contribution (RSC) which is an annual non-contributory employer contribution in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We recorded charges related to the employer contributions to global defined contribution plans of $732 million in 2021, $685 million in 2020 and $659 million in 2019.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 88\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nNote 12. Equity\nA. Common Stock Purchases\nWe purchase our common stock through privately negotiated transactions or in the open market as circumstances and prices warrant. Purchased shares under each of the share-purchase plans, which are authorized by our BOD, are available for general corporate purposes. In December 2017, the BOD authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program, which was exhausted in the first quarter of 2019. In December 2018, the BOD authorized another $10 billion share repurchase program to be utilized over time and share repurchases commenced thereunder in the first quarter of 2019.\nIn February 2019, we entered into an ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to repurchase $6.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase authorization. We paid $6.8 billion and received an initial delivery of 130 million shares of common stock, which represented approximately 80% of the notional amount of the ASR. In August 2019, the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC was completed resulting in Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC owing us an additional 33.5 million shares of our common stock. The average price paid for all of the shares delivered under the ASR was $41.42 per share. The common stock received is included in Treasury stock.\nThe following provides the number of shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share purchase plans, including our ASR:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(SHARES IN MILLIONS, DOLLARS IN BILLIONS) 2021\n2019(a)\nShares of common stock purchased - - 213\nCost of purchase $ - $ - $ 8.9\n(a)Represents shares purchased pursuant to the ASR with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC entered into in February 2019, as well as open market share repurchases of $2.1 billion.\nOur remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2021.\nB. Preferred Stock and Employee Stock Ownership Plans\nPrior to May 4, 2020, we had outstanding Series A convertible perpetual preferred stock (the Series A Preferred Stock) that was held by an ESOP trust (the Trust). All outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock were converted, at the direction of the independent fiduciary under the Trust and in accordance with the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock, into shares of our common stock on May 4, 2020. The Trust received an aggregate of 1,070,369 shares of our common stock upon conversion, with zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock remaining outstanding as a result of the conversion. In December 2020, we filed a certificate of elimination and a restated certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State, which eliminated the Series A Preferred Stock.\nSince May 4, 2020, we have one ESOP that holds common stock of the Company (Common ESOP). As of December 31, 2021, all shares of common stock held by the Common ESOP have been allocated to the Pfizer U.S. defined contribution plan participants. The compensation cost related to the Common ESOP was $19 million in 2021, $19 million in 2020 and $20 million in 2019.\nNote 13. Share-Based Payments\nOur compensation programs can include share-based payment awards with value that is determined by reference to the fair value of our shares and that provide for the grant of shares or options to acquire shares or similar arrangements. Our share-based awards are designed based on competitive survey data or industry peer groups used for compensation purposes, and are allocated between different long-term incentive awards, generally in the form of Total Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs), Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Portfolio Performance Shares (PPSs), Performance Share Awards (PSAs), Breakthrough Performance Awards (BPAs) and Stock Options, as determined by the Compensation Committee.\nThe 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the 2014 Plan. It provides for 400 million shares, in addition to shares remaining under the 2014 Plan, to be authorized for grants. The 2019 Plan provides that the number of stock options, TSRUs, RSUs, or performance-based awards that may be granted to any one individual during any 36-month period is limited to 20 million shares, and that RSUs count as three shares, PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as three shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as one share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 315 million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 89\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nA summary of the awards and valuation details:\nAwarded to Terms Valuation Recognition and Presentation\nTotal Shareholder Return Units (TSRUs)(a), (b)\nSenior and other key management and select employees Entitle the holder to receive shares of our common stock with a value equal to the difference between the defined settlement price and the grant price, plus the dividend equivalents accumulated during the five or seven-year term, if and to the extent the total value is positive.\nSettlement price is the average closing price of our common stock during the 20 trading days ending on the fifth or seventh anniversary of the grant, as applicable;

See Note 12.\nNote 15. Leases\nWe lease real estate, fleet, and equipment for use in our operations. Our leases generally have lease terms of 1 to 30 years, some of which include options to terminate or extend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a month-to-month basis. We include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determination of lease terms. We may negotiate termination clauses in anticipation of any changes in market conditions, but generally these termination options have not been exercised. Residual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of some fleet leases. In addition to base rent payments, the leases may require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease components, such as insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses, which may be dependent on usage or vary month-to-month. Variable lease payments amounted to $381 million in 2021, $380 million in 2020 and $326 million in 2019. We elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform the lease classification test as of the lease commencement date. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments.\nFor operating leases, the ROU assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) Balance Sheet Classification 2021 2020\nROU assets Other noncurrent assets $ 2,839 $ 1,386\nLease liabilities (short-term) Other current liabilities 449 320\nLease liabilities (long-term) Other noncurrent liabilities 2,510 1,108\nComponents of total lease cost includes:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nOperating lease cost $ 548 $ 432 $ 421\nVariable lease cost 381 380 326\nSublease income (41) (40) (45)\nTotal lease cost $ 888 $ 772 $ 702\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 93\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nOther supplemental information follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020\nOperating leases\nWeighted-Average Remaining Contractual Lease Term (Years) 12 6.9\nWeighted-Average Discount Rate 2.8 % 2.9 %\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 387 $ 333 $ 338\n(Gains)/losses on sale and leaseback transactions, net 1 (3) (29)\nThe following reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for the first five years and total of the remaining years to the operating lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021:\n(MILLIONS)\nPeriod Operating Lease Liabilities\nNext one year(a)\n$ 520\n1-2 years 417\n2-3 years 322\n3-4 years 279\n4-5 years 217\nThereafter 1,865\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 3,621\nLess: Imputed interest\nPresent value of minimum lease payments 2,960\nLess: Current portion\nNoncurrent portion $ 2,510\n(a)Reflects lease payments due within 12 months subsequent to the balance sheet date.\nNote 16. Contingencies and Certain Commitments\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies. The following outlines our legal contingencies. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5B.\nA. Legal Proceedings\nOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:\nPatent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from that product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.\nProduct liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.\nCommercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.\nGovernment investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.\nWe believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 94\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAmounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.\nThe principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a readers judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.\nA1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation\nWe are involved in suits relating to our patents, including but not limited to, those discussed below. Most involve claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. For example, some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.\nWe also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. In 2017, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) initiated proceedings with respect to two of our pneumococcal vaccine patents. However, the PTAB declined to initiate proceedings as to two other pneumococcal vaccine patents; those two patents, and one other patent, were challenged in federal court in Delaware. In September 2021, Pfizer and a challenger entered into a settlement and license agreement, resolving all worldwide legal proceedings involving that challenger, related to our pneumococcal vaccine patents. Other challenges to pneumococcal vaccine patents remain pending at the PTAB and outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines into the marketplace. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitors vaccine might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.\nWe are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. For example, our Hospira subsidiaries are involved in patent and patent-related disputes over their attempts to bring generic pharmaceutical and biosimilar products to market. If one of our marketed products is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\nActions In Which We Are The Plaintiff\nEpiPen\nIn 2010, King, which we acquired in 2011 and is a wholly-owned subsidiary, brought a patent-infringement action against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey in connection with Sandozs abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filed with the FDA seeking approval to market an epinephrine injectable product. Sandoz is challenging patents, which expire in 2025, covering the next-generation autoinjector for use with epinephrine that is sold under the EpiPen brand name.\nXeljanz (tofacitinib)\nBeginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.\nIn January 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Aurobindo Pharma Limited (Aurobindo) asserting the infringement and validity of the patent covering the active ingredient expiring in December 2025 and the patent covering a polymorphic form of tofacitinib expiring in 2023, which Aurobindo challenged in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg tablets.\nIn October 2021, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Sinotherapeutics Inc. (Sinotherapeutics) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Sinotherapeutics in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 11 mg extended release tablets.\nIn February 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (Teva) asserting the infringement and validity of our patent covering extended release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Teva in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 22 mg extended release tablets.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nIn February 2022, we brought a separate patent-infringement action against Slayback Pharma LLC (Slayback) asserting the infringement and validity of our compound patent covering the active ingredient that was challenged by Slayback in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib oral solution 1 mg/mL.\nInlyta (axitinib)\nIn 2019, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Glenmark) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Glenmark asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In 2019, we filed suit against Glenmark in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.\nIbrance (palbociclib)\nBeginning in September 2020, we received correspondence from several generic companies notifying us that they would seek approval to market generic versions of Ibrance capsules. The generic companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of our crystalline form patent which expires in 2034. Beginning in October 2020, we brought patent infringement actions against each of these generic companies in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent. We have settled with one of these generic companies on terms not material to the company.\nBeginning in January 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance tablets. The generic companies are challenging some or all of the following patents: (i) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2027; (ii) the composition of matter patent expiring in 2023; (iii) the method of use patent expiring in 2023; (iv) the crystalline form patent expiring in 2034; and (v) a tablet formulation patent expiring in 2036. We brought patent infringement actions against each of the generic filers in various federal courts, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies.\nEucrisa\nBeginning in September 2021, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Eucrisa. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of a composition of matter patent expiring in 2026, two method of use patents expiring in 2027, and one other method of use patent expiring in 2030. In September 2021, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents challenged by the generic companies.\nMatter Involving Our Collaboration/Licensing Partners\nEliquis\nIn 2017, twenty-five generic companies sent BMS Paragraph-IV certification letters informing BMS that they had filed ANDAs seeking approval of generic versions of Eliquis, challenging the validity and infringement of one or more of the three patents listed in the Orange Book for Eliquis. One of the patents expired in December 2019 and the remaining patents currently are set to expire in 2026 and 2031. Eliquis has been jointly developed and is being commercialized by BMS and Pfizer. BMS and Pfizer filed patent-infringement actions against all generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of West Virginia, asserting that each of the generic companies proposed products would infringe each of the patent(s) that each generic filer challenged. Some generic filers challenged only the 2031 patent, some challenged both the 2031 and 2026 patent, and one generic company challenged all three patents. In August 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled that both the 2026 patent and the 2031 patent are valid and infringed by the proposed generic products. In August and September 2020, the generic filers appealed the District Courts decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Prior to the August 2020 ruling, we and BMS settled with certain of the companies on terms not material to us, and we and BMS may settle with other generic companies in the future. In September 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Courts decision.\nA2. Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation\nWe are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.\nAsbestos\nBetween 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.\nNumerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.\nThere also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.\nEffexor\nBeginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 96\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\npurported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nLipitor\nBeginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/or state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other Multi-District Litigation plaintiffs. All plaintiffs have appealed the District Courts orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nAlso, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.\nEpiPen (Direct Purchaser)\nIn February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nNexium 24HR and Protonix\nA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of our Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK, the JV has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR.\nDocetaxel\nPersonal Injury Actions\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nMississippi Attorney General Government Action\nIn 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product and eight other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.\nZantac\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Plaintiffs in the Multi-District Litigation have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 97\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nstatutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. Plaintiffs previously had filed a consolidated third-party payor class action complaint alleging violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute and seeking reimbursement for payments made for the prescription version of Zantac, but the Multi-District Litigation court dismissed that complaint; Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state court, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court.\nChantix\nBeginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizers voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.\nA3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters\nMonsanto-Related Matters\nIn 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.\nIn connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacias former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nIn connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutias indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsantos chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutias and New Monsantos assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsantos chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nEnvironmental Matters\nIn 2009, we submitted a revised site-wide feasibility study with regard to the Wyeth Holdings Corporation (formerly, American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In 2011, Wyeth Holdings Corporation executed an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent for Removal Action (the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to the Bound Brook facility. In accordance with the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement, we completed construction of an interim remedy. In 2012, the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the Bound Brook facilitys main plant area. In 2013, Wyeth Holdings Corporation (now Wyeth Holdings LLC) entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the main plant area and to perform a focused feasibility study for two adjacent lagoons. In 2015, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey that allows Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and to implement the remedy for the main plant area. The consent decree (which supersedes the 2011 Administrative Settlement Agreement) was entered by the District Court in 2015. In 2018, the EPA issued a final remediation plan for the two adjacent lagoons. In 2019, Wyeth Holdings LLC entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to allow us to undertake detailed engineering design of the remedy for the lagoons. In September 2021, the U.S., on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint and consent decree with the federal District Court for the District of New Jersey, which the court approved in November 2021, that will allow Wyeth Holdings LLC to complete the design and implement the remedy for the two adjacent lagoons.\nWe have accrued for the estimated costs of the site remedies for the Bound Brook facility.\nWe are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.\nContracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health\nIn 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals decision.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 98\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nAllergan Complaint for Indemnity\nIn 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer's acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.\nBreach of Contract--Xalkori/Lorbrena\nWe are a defendant in a breach of contract action brought by New York University (NYU) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (Supreme Court). NYU alleges that it is entitled to royalties on Pfizers sales of Xalkori under the terms of a Research and License Agreement between NYU and Sugen, Inc. Sugen, Inc. was acquired by Pharmacia in August 1999, and Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. The action was originally filed in 2013. In 2015, the Supreme Court dismissed the action and, in 2017, the New York State Appellate Division reversed the decision and remanded the proceedings to the Supreme Court. In January 2020, the Supreme Court denied both parties summary judgment motions.\nIn October 2020, NYU filed a separate breach of contract action against Pfizer alleging that it is entitled to royalties on sales of Lorbrena under the terms of the same NYU-Sugen, Inc. Research and Licensing Agreement. In February 2022, the parties reached an agreement to settle both breach of contract actions on terms not material to Pfizer.\nViatris Securities Litigation\nIn October 2021, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of former Mylan N.V. shareholders who received Viatris common stock in exchange for Mylan shares in connection with the spin-off of the Upjohn Business and its combination with Mylan (the Transactions). Viatris, Pfizer, and certain of each companys current and former officers, directors and employees are named as defendants. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain disclosures made in or omitted from the registration statement and related prospectus issued in connection with the Transactions. Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.\nA4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.\nGreenstone Investigations\nU.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation\nSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business. We believe this is related to an ongoing broader antitrust investigation of the generic pharmaceutical industry. We have produced records relating to this investigation.\nState Attorneys General and Multi-District Generics Antitrust Litigation\nIn April 2018, Greenstone received requests for information from the Antitrust Department of the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General. In May 2019, Attorneys General of more than 40 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico filed a complaint against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer. The matter has been consolidated with a Multi-District Litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaint alleges anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. In June 2020, the State Attorneys General filed a new complaint against a large number of companies, including Greenstone and Pfizer, making similar allegations, but concerning a new set of drugs. This complaint was transferred to the Multi-District Litigation in July 2020. The Multi-District Litigation also includes civil complaints filed by private plaintiffs and state counties against Pfizer, Greenstone and a significant number of other defendants asserting allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General.\nSubpoena relating to Manufacturing of Quillivant XR\nIn October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR. We have produced records pursuant to the subpoena.\nGovernment Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies\nIn February 2019, we received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the SDNY. The civil investigative demand seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at the Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Missouri seeking similar records and information. We are producing records in response to these requests.\nU.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to Russian Operations\nIn June 2019, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justices FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Russia. In September 2019, we received a similar request from the SECs FCPA Unit. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.\nDocetaxel--Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation\nSee Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation--Docetaxel--Mississippi Attorney General Government Investigation above for information regarding a government investigation related to Docetaxel marketing practices.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 99\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nU.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations\nIn March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our manufacturing operations in India, including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation concerning operations at our facilities in India. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.\nU.S. Department of Justice/SEC Inquiry relating to China Operations\nIn June 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice's FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in China. In August 2020, we received a similar request from the SECs FCPA Unit. We are producing records pursuant to these requests.\nZantac--State of New Mexico and Mayor and City Council of Baltimore Civil Actions\nSee Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation--Zantac above for information regarding civil actions separately filed by the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions.\nA5. Legal Proceedings--Matters Resolved During 2021\nDuring 2021, certain matters, including the matter discussed below, were resolved or became the subject of definitive settlement agreements or settlement agreements-in-principle.\nEpiPen\nBeginning in 2017, purported class actions were filed in various federal courts by indirect purchasers of EpiPen against Pfizer, and/or its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and/or various entities affiliated with Mylan, and Mylan former Chief Executive Officer, Heather Bresch. The plaintiffs in these actions represent U.S. nationwide classes comprising persons or entities who paid for any portion of the end-user purchase price of an EpiPen between 2009 until the cessation of the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct. Against Pfizer and/or its affiliates, plaintiffs in these actions generally allege that Pfizers and/or its affiliates settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal and various state antitrust laws. At least one lawsuit also alleges that Pfizer and/or Mylan violated RICO. Plaintiffs also filed various federal antitrust, state consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims against, and relating to conduct attributable solely to, Mylan and/or its affiliates regarding EpiPen. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In 2017, all of these indirect purchase actions were consolidated for coordinated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi-District Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas with other EpiPen-related actions against Mylan and/or its affiliates to which Pfizer, King and Meridian are not parties. In July 2021, Pfizer and plaintiffs filed a stipulation of settlement to resolve the Multi-District Litigation for $345 million. The District Court approved the settlement in November 2021, and the payment was made in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.\nB. Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations has been included in our financial statements and is not material to Pfizer.\nIn addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may agree to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, Viatris has agreed to assume, and to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of certain matters.\nWe have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer. See Note 7D.\nC. Certain Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had commitments totaling $5.2 billion that are legally binding and enforceable. These commitments include payments relating to potential milestone payments deemed reasonably likely to occur, and purchase obligations for goods and services.\nSee Note 5A for information on the TCJA repatriation tax liability.\nD. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions\nWe may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1E. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of December 31, 2021 is $697 million, of which $135 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $563 million in Other noncurrent liabilities, and as of December 31, 2020 is $689 million, of which $123 million is recorded in Other current liabilities and $566 million in Other noncurrent liabilities. The increase in the contingent consideration balance from December 31, 2020 is primarily due to fair value adjustments, partially offset by payments made upon the achievement of certain sales-based milestones.\nE. Insurance\nOur insurance coverage reflects market conditions (including cost and availability) existing at the time it is written, and our decision to obtain insurance coverage or to self-insure varies accordingly. Depending upon the cost and availability of insurance and the nature of the risk involved, the amount of self-insurance may be significant. The cost and availability of coverage have resulted in self-insuring certain exposures, including product liability. If we incur substantial liabilities that are not covered by insurance or substantially exceed insurance\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 100\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\ncoverage and that are in excess of existing accruals, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations in the period in which the amounts are paid and/or accrued.\nNote 17. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\nA. Segment Information\nWe regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. With the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019 and the completion of the spin-off of our Upjohn Business in the fourth quarter of 2020, Pfizer transformed into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines and vaccines and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 operated as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Biopharma is a science-based medicines business that includes six therapeutic areas - Oncology, Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease, Hospital, Vaccines and Internal Medicine. The Hospital therapeutic area commercializes our global portfolio of sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines.\nEach operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from GPD and WRDM. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We have revised prior-period information (Revenues and Earnings, as defined by management) to conform to the current management structure.\nOther Costs and Business Activities\nCertain pre-tax costs are not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with the following:\nWRDM--the R&D and Medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization, which is generally responsible for research projects for our Biopharma portfolio until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the GPD organization for possible clinical and commercial development. R&D spending may include upfront and milestone payments for intellectual property rights. The WRDM organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide end-to-end technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, as well as the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, which ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders--including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities--with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizers medicines.\nGPD--the costs associated with our GPD organization, which is generally responsible for clinical trials from WRDM in the Biopharma portfolio, including late-stage portfolio spend. GPD also provides technical support and other services to Pfizer R&D projects. GPD is responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies.\nCorporate and Other Unallocated--the costs associated with (i) corporate enabling functions (such as digital, global real estate operations, legal, finance, human resources, worldwide public affairs, compliance and worldwide procurement, among others), all strategy, business development, portfolio management and valuation capabilities, patient advocacy activities and certain compensation and other corporate costs, such as interest income and expense, and gains and losses on investments; (ii) overhead expenses primarily associated with our manufacturing (which include manufacturing variances associated with production) operations that are not directly assessed to an operating segment, as business unit (segment) management does not manage these costs; and (iii) our share of earnings from the Consumer Healthcare JV.\nCertain transactions and events such as (i) purchase accounting adjustments, where we incur expenses associated with the amortization of fair value adjustments to inventory, intangible assets and PP&E; (ii) acquisition-related items, where we incur costs for executing the transaction, integrating the acquired operations and restructuring the combined company; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (such as pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses, gains on the completion of joint venture transactions, restructuring charges, legal charges or net gains and losses on investments in equity securities) that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis. Such items can include, but are not limited to, non-acquisition-related restructuring costs, as well as costs incurred for legal settlements, asset impairments and disposals of assets or businesses, including, as applicable, any associated transition activities.\nThe operating results of PC1, our global contract development and manufacturing organization, and through July 31, 2019 our former Consumer Healthcare business are included in Other business activities.\nSegment Assets\nWe manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $181 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $154 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 101\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nSelected Income Statement Information\nThe following table provides selected income statement information by reportable segment:\nRevenues Earnings(a)\nDepreciation and Amortization(b)\nYear Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS OF DOLLARS) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nReportable Segment:\nBiopharma $ 79,557 $ 40,724 $ 38,013 $ 40,226 $ 27,089 $ 24,419 $ 1,439 $ 1,013 $ 978\nOther business activities(c)\n1,731 926 2,892 (10,396) (12,308) (11,216) 598 603 592\nReconciling Items:\nPurchase accounting adjustments - - - (3,175) (3,117) (4,153) 3,067 3,047 4,145\nAcquisition-related costs - - - (52) (44) (185) - - 3\nCertain significant items(d)\n- - - (2,292) (4,584) 2,456 87 18 37\n$ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905 $ 24,311 $ 7,036 $ 11,321 $ 5,191 $ 4,681 $ 5,755\n(a)Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income.

For additional information, see Notes 2A, 2C, 3 and 4.\nB. Geographic Information\nThe following summarizes revenues by geographic area:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(MILLIONS) 2021 2020 2019\nUnited States $ 29,746 $ 21,455 $ 20,326\nDeveloped Europe 18,336 7,788 7,729\nDeveloped Rest of World 12,506 4,036 4,022\nEmerging Markets 20,701 8,372 8,828\nRevenues\n$ 81,288 $ 41,651 $ 40,905\nRevenues exceeded $500 million in each of 21, 8 and 10 countries outside the U.S. in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The U.S. is the only country to contribute more than 10% of total revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of revenues, our largest national market outside the U.S. was Japan, which contributed 9% of total revenue in 2021 and 6% in each of 2020 and 2019.\nWe and our collaboration partner, BioNTech, have entered into agreements to supply pre-specified doses of Comirnaty with multiple developed and emerging nations around the world and are continuing to deliver doses of Comirnaty under such agreements. We currently sell the Comirnaty vaccine directly to government and government sponsored customers. This includes supply agreements entered into in November 2020 and February and May 2021 with the EC on behalf of the different EU member states and certain other countries. Each EU member state submits its own Comirnaty vaccine order to us and is responsible for payment pursuant to terms of the supply agreements negotiated by the EC.\nC. Other Revenue Information\nSignificant Customers\nOur prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies.

Prior to its sale, Meridian was managed as part of the Hospital therapeutic area. On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and the combination of our Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris. On December 21, 2020, Pfizer and Viatris completed the termination of the Mylan-Japan collaboration. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the financial results of Meridian are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business and Mylan-Japan collaboration were reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period financial information has been restated, as appropriate. See Note 1A.\n(b)At the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, we reorganized our commercial operations and began to manage our commercial operations through a new global structure consisting of two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, our innovative science-based biopharmaceutical business and PC1. PC1, which previously had been managed within the Hospital therapeutic area, includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($320 million for 2021 and $0 million for 2020 and 2019), and active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships, including but not limited to, transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with Viatris following the spin-off of the Upjohn Business. We have revised prior period information to conform to the current management structure.\n(c)Prevnar family include revenues from Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (pediatric and adult) and Prevnar 20 (adult).\n(d)Biosimilars are highly similar versions of approved and authorized biological medicines and primarily include revenues from Inflectra/Remsima, Ruxience, Retacrit, Zirabev and Trazimera.\n(e)Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) products include the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig.\n(f)On July 31, 2019, our Consumer Healthcare business, an OTC medicines business, was combined with GSKs consumer healthcare business to form a new consumer healthcare JV. See Note 2C.\n(g)Total Sterile Injectable Pharmaceuticals represents the total of all branded and generic injectable products in the Hospital therapeutic area, including anti-infective sterile injectable pharmaceuticals.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nContracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totals $34.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred and amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver the product to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, we expect to recognize revenue of\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 104\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\n$22.3 billion in 2022, $11.8 billion in 2023 and $265 million in 2024. Remaining performance obligations exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.\nDeferred Revenues\nOur deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable in connection with contracts that we entered into during 2021 and 2020 with various government or government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues associated with the advance payments related to Comirnaty total $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $957 million as of December 31, 2020, with $3.0 billion and $249 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively as of December 31, 2021, and $957 million recorded in current liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The increase in the Comirnaty deferred revenues during 2021 was the result of additional advance payments received as we entered into new or amended contracts or as we invoiced customers in advance of vaccine deliveries less amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered doses to our customers. During 2021, we recognized in revenue substantially all of the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2020. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2021 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as we deliver doses of the vaccine to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nPfizer Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 105\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nPfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nQuarter\n(MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER COMMON SHARE DATA) First Second Third Fourth\n2021(a)\nRevenues $ 14,516 $ 18,899 $ 24,035 $ 23,838\nCosts and expenses(b)\n8,802 11,951 15,546 19,876\nRestructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs(c)\n22 (1) 646 135\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss)\n5,692 6,949 7,843 3,827\nProvision/(benefit) for taxes on income/(loss)(d)\n808 1,123 (328) 249\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations 4,885 5,825 8,171 3,578\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax(e)\n1 (236) (13) (187)\nNet income/(loss) before allocation to noncontrolling interests 4,886 5,589 8,159 3,391\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 26 12 (2)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 4,877 $ 5,563 $ 8,146 $ 3,393\nEarnings/(loss) per common share-basic:\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.87 $ 1.04 $ 1.45 $ 0.64\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax - (0.04) - (0.03)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders $ 0.87 $ 0.99 $ 1.45 $ 0.60\nEarnings/(loss) per common share-diluted:\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.86 $ 1.02 $ 1.43 $ 0.62\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax - (0.04) - (0.03)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders\n$ 0.86 $ 0.98 $ 1.42 $ 0.59\n(a)Business development activities impacted our results of operations in 2021.

See Notes 2A, D and E.\n(c)The third and fourth quarters of 2021 primarily include employee termination costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company program.
