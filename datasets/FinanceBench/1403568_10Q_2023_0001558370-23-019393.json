Statements\n(In thousands, except per share and store count data) (Unaudited)\n1.Business and basis of presentation\nUlta Beauty, Inc. was founded in 1990 to operate specialty retail stores selling cosmetics, fragrance, haircare and skincare products, and related accessories and services. Nearly every store features a full-service salon. As used in these notes and throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, all references to we, us, our, Ulta Beauty, or the Company refer to Ulta Beauty, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAs of October 28, 2023, the Company operated 1,374 stores across 50 states, as shown in the table below.\nNumber of\nNumber of\nLocation\nstores\nLocation\nstores\nAlabama\nMontana\nAlaska\nNebraska\nArizona\nNevada\nArkansas\nNew Hampshire\nCalifornia\nNew Jersey\nColorado\nNew Mexico\nConnecticut\nNew York\nDelaware\nNorth Carolina\nFlorida\nNorth Dakota\nGeorgia\nOhio\nHawaii\nOklahoma\nIdaho\nOregon\nIllinois\nPennsylvania\nIndiana\nRhode Island\nIowa\nSouth Carolina\nKansas\nSouth Dakota\nKentucky\nTennessee\nLouisiana\nTexas\nMaine\nUtah\nMaryland\nVermont\nMassachusetts\nVirginia\nMichigan\nWashington\nMinnesota\nWest Virginia\nMississippi\nWisconsin\nMissouri\nWyoming\nTotal\n1,374\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions Article 10, Regulation S-X. These financial statements were prepared on a consolidated basis to include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts, transactions, and unrealized profit were eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary to fairly state the financial position and results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented.\nThe Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuation, with significant portions of net sales and net income being realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. The results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2024, or for any other future interim period or for any future year.\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023. All amounts are stated in thousands, with the exception of per share amounts and number of stores.\n2.Summary of significant accounting policies\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023. Presented below and in the following notes is supplemental information that should be read in conjunction with Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.\nFiscal quarter\nThe Companys quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The third quarter in fiscal 2023 and 2022 ended on October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the accounting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers its accounting policies relating to inventory valuations, vendor allowances, impairment of long-lived tangible and right-of-use assets, loyalty program and income taxes to be the most significant accounting policies that involve management estimates and judgments. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n3.Revenue\nNet sales include retail stores and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon services and other revenue. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nDisaggregated revenue\nThe following table sets forth the approximate percentage of net sales by primary category:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(Percentage of net sales)\nCosmetics\n42%\n44%\n42%\n43%\nHaircare products and styling tools\n19%\n21%\n20%\n21%\nSkincare\n19%\n16%\n19%\n17%\nFragrance and bath\n13%\n12%\n12%\n12%\nServices\n4%\n4%\n4%\n4%\nAccessories and other\n3%\n3%\n3%\n3%\n100%\n100%\n100%\n100%\nDeferred revenue\nDeferred revenue primarily represents contract liabilities for the obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a guest for which the Company has received consideration, such as unredeemed Ultamate Rewards loyalty points and unredeemed Ulta Beauty gift cards. In addition, breakage on gift cards is recognized proportionately as redemption occurs.\nThe following table provides a summary of the changes included in deferred revenue during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n346,067\n$\n305,913\n$\n388,583\n$\n345,206\nAdditions to contract liabilities (1)\n107,628\n97,521\n250,121\n224,938\nDeductions to contract liabilities (2)\n(109,304)\n(99,443)\n(294,313)\n(266,153)\nEnding balance\n$\n344,391\n$\n303,991\n$\n344,391\n$\n303,991\n(1) Loyalty points and gift cards issued in the current period but not redeemed or expired.\n(2) Revenue recognized in the current period related to the beginning liability.\nOther amounts included in deferred revenue were $6,546 and $8,141 at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\n4.Goodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired, was $10,870 at October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022. No additional goodwill was recognized during the 13 and 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. The recoverability of goodwill is reviewed annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist.\nOther definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. The recoverability of intangible assets is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.\n5.Leases\nThe Company leases retail stores, distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, market fulfillment centers, corporate offices, and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2036. All leases are classified as operating leases and generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and, when determined applicable, include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases. Leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLease cost\nThe majority of operating lease cost relates to retail stores, distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers, and market fulfillment centers and is classified within cost of sales. Operating lease cost for corporate offices is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating lease cost from the control date through store opening date is classified within pre-opening expenses.\nThe following table presents a summary of operating lease costs:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n84,074\n$\n80,371\n$\n252,323\n$\n240,366\nOther information\nThe following table presents supplemental disclosures of cash flow information related to operating leases:\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities (1)\n$\n296,115\n$\n286,016\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities (non-cash)\n249,826\n297,232\n(1) Excludes $27,682 and $21,347 related to cash received for tenant incentives for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\n6.Commitments and contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of the business including both class action and single plaintiff litigation. In the opinion of management, the amount of any liability with respect to these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n7.Debt\nOn February 27, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association, as Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party thereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 11, 2025, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $1,000,000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and satisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50,000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $100,000, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of the Companys assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Companys election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.125% or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.250%, and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, with such margins based on the Companys borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.20% per annum.\nAs of October 28, 2023, the Company had $195,400 outstanding under the credit facility, and the weighted average interest rate was 8.21% for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023. As of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nAs of October 28, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\n8.Fair value measurements\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term debt approximates their estimated fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nFair value is measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy, which are described as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 - observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data.\n\u25cf Level 3 - unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which would require the Company to develop its own assumptions.\nAs of October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022, there were liabilities related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets of $41,633, $37,501, and $34,839, respectively. The liabilities are categorized as Level 2 as they are based on third-party reported values, which are based primarily on quoted market prices of underlying assets of the funds within the plan.\n9.Stock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The estimated grant date fair value of stock options was determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model using the following weighted-average assumptions for the periods indicated:\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nVolatility rate\n45.0%\n49.0%\nAverage risk-free interest rate\n3.8%\n2.4%\nAverage expected life (in years)\n3.4\n3.4\nDividend yield\n-\n-\nThe expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Companys common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected life of options granted is derived from historical data on Ulta Beauty stock option exercises. Forfeitures of stock options are estimated at the grant date based on historical rates of stock option activity and reduce the stock-based compensation expense recognized. The Company does not currently pay a regular dividend.\nThe Company granted 42 and 48 stock options during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options was $1,742 and $1,646 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options was $4,961 and $6,152 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of these stock options was $199.15 and $149.14 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. At October 28, 2023, there was approximately $13,028 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock options.\nThere were 48 and 58 restricted stock units issued during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units was $4,959 and $4,544 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units was $14,252 and $13,983 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. At October 28, 2023, there was approximately $32,630 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units.\nThere were 33 and 37 performance-based restricted stock units issued during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock units was $5,237 and $3,489 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based restricted stock units was $14,264 and $12,419 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. At October 28, 2023, there was approximately $28,755 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units.\n10.Income taxes\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which the Company operates stores. Income tax expense of $80,241 for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 represents an effective tax rate of 24.3%, compared to $88,120 of tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022.\nIncome tax expense of $278,597 for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%, compared to $289,891 of tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was enacted into law, which, among other things, introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations and created a 1% excise tax on net share repurchases. The corporate alternative minimum tax will be effective in fiscal 2024 and is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The excise tax applies to share repurchases made after December 31, 2022.\n11.Net income per common share\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares of common stock used in the computation of net income per basic and diluted common share:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet income\n$\n249,483\n$\n274,585\n$\n896,636\n$\n901,657\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares - Basic\n49,007\n51,131\n49,592\n51,663\nDilutive effect of stock options and non-vested stock\nWeighted-average common shares - Diluted\n49,226\n51,418\n49,846\n51,962\nNet income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n5.09\n$\n5.37\n$\n18.08\n$\n17.45\nDiluted\n$\n5.07\n$\n5.34\n$\n17.99\n$\n17.35\nThe denominator for diluted net income per common share for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 excludes 124 and 50 employee stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. The denominator for diluted net income per common share for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022 excludes 144 and 119 employee stock options and restricted stock units, respectively, due to their anti-dilutive effects. Outstanding performance-based restricted stock units are included in the computation of dilutive shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions are satisfied prior to the end of the reporting period or would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the results would be dilutive under the treasury stock method.\n12.Share repurchase program\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2,000,000 of the Companys common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The authorized value of shares available to be repurchased under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program excludes excise tax. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nShares repurchased\n1,821\n1,470\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, including excise tax\n$\n848,356\n$\n571,908\nItem 2.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report.

We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, select beauty services, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category, uses beauty for self-expression, experimentation and self-investment, and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our financial performance.\nToday, we are the largest specialty beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. Key aspects of our business include: a differentiated assortment of more than 25,000 beauty products across a variety of categories and price points as well as a variety of beauty services, including salon services, in more than 1,350 stores predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations; engaging digital experiences delivered through our website, Ulta.com, and our mobile applications; our best-in-class loyalty program that enables members to earn points for every dollar spent on products and beauty services and provides us with deep, proprietary customer insights; and our ability to cultivate human connection with warm and welcoming guest experiences across all of our channels.\nThe continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income, and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our strategic priorities: 1) drive breakthrough and disruptive growth through an expanded definition of All Things Beauty; 2) evolve the omnichannel experience through connected physical and digital ecosystems, All In Your World; 3) expand and deepen our presence across the beauty journey, solidifying Ulta Beauty at the Heart of the Beauty Community; 4) drive operational excellence and optimization; 5) protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent; and 6) expand our environmental and social impact. We believe the attractive and growing U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the expanding definition of beauty and the role that omnichannel capabilities play in consumers lives, coupled with Ulta Beautys competitive strengths, position us to capture additional market share in the industry.\nComparable sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable sales have fluctuated in the past, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable sales, including general U.S. economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others.\nOver the long term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through growing our comparable sales, expanding omnichannel capabilities, and opening new stores. Long-term operating profit is expected to increase as a result of our\nefforts to optimize our real estate portfolio, expand merchandise margin, and leverage our fixed store costs with comparable sales increases and operating efficiencies, partially offset by incremental investments in people, guest experiences, systems, and supply chain required to support a 1,500 to 1,700 store chain in the U.S. with successful e-commerce and competitive omnichannel capabilities.\nCurrent Trends\nIndustry trends\nOur research indicates that Ulta Beauty has captured meaningful market share across all categories over the last several years. The overall beauty market expanded in 2022 and into the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023, supported by healthy consumer engagement with the beauty category. We remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains over the long term.\nImpact of inflation and other macroeconomic trends\nAlthough we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our sales during the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023, continued pressure from inflation or other evolving macroeconomic conditions could have an adverse impact on consumer spending and could lead to a recession. Furthermore, inflationary pressures, as well as other macroeconomic trends, could negatively impact our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with higher costs. In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on any outstanding debt.\nBasis of presentation\nThe Company has one reportable segment, which includes retail stores, salon services, and e-commerce.\nWe recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores. E-commerce sales are recognized upon shipment or guest pickup of the merchandise based on meeting the transfer of control criteria. Retail store and e-commerce sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Shipping and handling are treated as costs to fulfill the contract and not a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, we recognize revenue for our single performance obligation related to online sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is at the time of shipment or guest pickup. We provide refunds for merchandise returns within 60 days from the original purchase date. State sales taxes are presented on a net basis as we consider our self a pass-through conduit for collecting and remitting state sales tax. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided to the guest. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the guest redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Other revenue includes the private label and co-branded credit card programs, royalties derived from the partnership with Target Corporation, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.\nComparable sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of operations plus the initial one-month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year. Remodeled stores are included in comparable sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. Comparable sales include retail sales, salon services, and e-commerce. In fiscal years with 53 weeks, the 53rd week of comparable sales is included in the calculation. In the year following a 53-week year, the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales.\nMeasuring comparable sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable sales results:\n\u25cf the general national, regional, and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products or brands;\n\u25cf the location of new stores in existing store markets;\n\u25cf competition;\n\u25cf our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our various merchandising and marketing activities; and\n\u25cf the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores.\nCost of sales includes:\n\u25cf the cost of merchandise sold, offset by vendor income that is not a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n\u25cf distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance;\n\u25cf shipping and handling costs;\n\u25cf retail store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, and licenses;\n\u25cf salon services payroll and benefits; and\n\u25cf shrink and inventory valuation reserves.\nOur cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open new stores. Changes in our merchandise or channel mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include:\n\u25cf payroll, bonus, and benefit costs for retail store and corporate employees;\n\u25cf advertising and marketing costs, offset by vendor income that is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs;\n\u25cf occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities;\n\u25cf stock-based compensation expense;\n\u25cf depreciation and amortization for all assets, except those related to our retail stores and distribution operations, which are included in cost of sales; and\n\u25cf legal, finance, information systems, and other corporate overhead costs.\nThis presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses.\nPre-opening expenses include non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled, and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising.\nInterest income represents interest primarily from cash equivalents, which include highly liquid investments such as money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Interest expense includes interest costs and facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset-based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates.\nIncome tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores.\nResults of operations\nOur quarterly periods are the 13 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. The Companys third quarter in fiscal 2023 and 2022 ended on October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively.\nOur quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe following tables present the components of our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated:\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNet sales\n$\n2,488,933\n$\n2,338,793\n$\n7,653,005\n$\n6,981,807\nCost of sales\n1,496,866\n1,375,976\n4,612,469\n4,149,800\nGross profit\n992,067\n962,817\n3,040,536\n2,832,007\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n661,380\n597,164\n1,874,201\n1,632,593\nPre-opening expenses\n3,460\n3,797\n5,396\n8,422\nOperating income\n327,227\n361,856\n1,160,939\n1,190,992\nInterest income, net\n(2,497)\n(849)\n(14,294)\n(556)\nIncome before income taxes\n329,724\n362,705\n1,175,233\n1,191,548\nIncome tax expense\n80,241\n88,120\n278,597\n289,891\nNet income\n$\n249,483\n$\n274,585\n$\n896,636\n$\n901,657\nOther operating data:\nNumber of stores end of period\n1,374\n1,343\n1,374\n1,343\nComparable sales\n4.5%\n14.6%\n7.3%\n15.6%\n13 Weeks Ended\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(Percentage of net sales)\nNet sales\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nCost of sales\n60.1%\n58.8%\n60.3%\n59.4%\nGross profit\n39.9%\n41.2%\n39.7%\n40.6%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n26.6%\n25.5%\n24.5%\n23.4%\nPre-opening expenses\n0.1%\n0.2%\n0.1%\n0.1%\nOperating income\n13.1%\n15.5%\n15.2%\n17.1%\nInterest income, net\n(0.1%)\n0.0%\n(0.2%)\n0.0%\nIncome before income taxes\n13.2%\n15.5%\n15.4%\n17.1%\nIncome tax expense\n3.2%\n3.8%\n3.6%\n4.2%\nNet income\n10.0%\n11.7%\n11.7%\n12.9%\nComparison of 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 to 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $150.1 million or 6.4%, to $2.5 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $2.3 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The net sales increase was primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, and an increase in other revenue compared to the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The total comparable sales increase of 4.5% during the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 was driven by a 5.9% increase in transactions and a 1.4% decrease in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $29.3 million or 3.0%, to $992.1 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $962.8 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.9% for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to 41.2% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $64.2 million or 10.8%, to $661.4 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $597.2 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.6% for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to 25.5% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, primarily due to higher corporate overhead due to strategic investments, higher store expenses, higher store payroll and benefits, and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $3.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 compared to $3.8 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income was $2.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 compared to $0.8 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, due to higher average interest rates on cash balances. As of October 28, 2023, we had $195.4 million outstanding under the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $80.2 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 represents an effective tax rate of 24.3%, compared to $88.1 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022.\nNet income\nNet income was $249.5 million for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $274.6 million for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The decrease in net income is primarily related to the $64.2 million increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by the $29.3 million increase in gross profit, the $7.9 million decrease in income taxes, and the $1.6 million increase in interest income.\nComparison of 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 to 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022\nNet sales\nNet sales increased $671.2 million or 9.6%, to $7.7 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $7.0 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The net sales increase was primarily due to increased comparable sales, strong new store performance, and an increase in other revenue compared to the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The total comparable sales increase of 7.3% during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 was driven by an 8.7% increase in transactions and a 1.4% decrease in average ticket.\nGross profit\nGross profit increased $208.5 million or 7.4%, to $3.0 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $2.8 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 39.7% for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to 40.6% for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink, higher supply chain costs, and deleverage of salon expenses, partially offset by strong growth in other revenue and leverage of store fixed costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSG&A expenses increased $241.6 million or 14.8%, to $1.9 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $1.6 billion for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 24.5% for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to 23.4% for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022, primarily due to higher corporate overhead due to strategic investments, higher store payroll and benefits, higher marketing expenses, and higher store expenses, partially offset by lower incentive compensation.\nPre-opening expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $5.4 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 compared to $8.4 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022.\nInterest income, net\nNet interest income was $14.3 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 compared to $0.6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022 due to higher average interest rates on cash balances. As of October 28, 2023, we had $195.4 million outstanding under the credit facility. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense of $278.6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 represents an effective tax rate of 23.7%, compared to $289.9 million of income tax expense representing an effective tax rate of 24.3% for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from income tax accounting for stock-based compensation.\nNet income\nNet income was $896.6 million for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 compared to $901.7 million for the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022. The decrease in net income is primarily related to the $241.6 million increase in SG&A expenses, partially offset by the $208.5 million increase in gross profit, the $13.7 million increase in interest income, and the $11.3 million decrease in income taxes.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant components of our working capital are merchandise inventories, receivables, and\ncash and cash equivalents reduced by accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and deferred revenue. As of October 28, 2023, January 28, 2023, and October 29, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $121.8 million, $737.9 million, and $250.6 million, respectively.\nOur primary cash needs are for rent, capital expenditures for new, remodeled, and relocated stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion and new brand additions, supply chain improvements, share repurchases, and continued investment in our information technology systems.\nOur most significant ongoing short-term cash requirements relate primarily to funding operations (including expenditures for lease expenses, inventory, labor, distribution, advertising and marketing, and tax liabilities) as well as periodic spend for capital expenditures, investments, and share repurchases. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season.\nLong-term cash requirements primarily relate to funding lease expenses and other purchase commitments.\nWe generally fund short-term and long-term cash requirements with cash from operating activities and supplement with borrowings under our credit facility, as necessary. We believe our primary sources of liquidity will satisfy our cash requirements over both the short-term (the next twelve months) and long-term.\nCash flows\nWe believe our ability to generate substantial cash from operating activities and readily secure financing at competitive rates are key strengths that give us significant flexibility to meet our short and long-term financial commitments.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022:\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n358,011\n$\n573,426\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(315,900)\n(207,029)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(658,177)\n(547,329)\nOperating activities\nOperating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash lease expense, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes.\nThe decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2022 was mainly due to a larger increase in merchandise inventories in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023, the timing of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, and the timing of receivable collections, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid income taxes and prepaid expenses.\nMerchandise inventories, net were $2.3 billion at October 28, 2023, compared to $2.1 billion at October 29, 2022, representing an increase of $206.6 million or 9.8%. The increase in total inventory is primarily due to the following:\n\u25cf $76 million increase to support increased demand and product cost increases;\n\u25cf $49 million increase due to the addition of 31 net new stores opened since October 28, 2022;\n\u25cf $43 million increase due to our new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina; and\n\u25cf $40 million increase due to new brand launches.\nInvesting activities\nWe have historically used cash primarily for new, remodeled, relocated, and refreshed stores, supply chain investments, short-term investments, and investments in information technology systems. Investing activities for capital expenditures were $311.0 million during the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to $204.0 million during the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022.\nDuring the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023, we opened 20 new stores, relocated five stores, and remodeled 16 stores, compared to the 39 weeks ended October 29, 2022, when we opened 35 new stores, relocated 11 stores, and remodeled eight stores.\nThe increase in net cash used in investing activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher capital expenditures.\nOur future investments will depend primarily on the number of new, remodeled, and relocated stores, information technology systems, and supply chain investments we undertake and the timing of these expenditures. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures.\nFinancing activities\nFinancing activities include share repurchases, borrowing and repayment of our revolving credit facility, and capital stock transactions. Purchases of treasury shares represent the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nThe increase in net cash used in financing activities in the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2023 compared to the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases, partially offset by borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nAs of October 28, 2023, we had $195.4 million outstanding under the credit facility, and we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022.\nShare repurchase program\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program) pursuant to which the Company may repurchase up to $2.0 billion of the Companys common stock. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program revokes the previously authorized but unused amounts from the earlier share repurchase program. The authorized value of shares available to be repurchased under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program excludes excise tax. The 2022 Share Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nA summary of common stock repurchase activity is presented in the following table:\n39 Weeks Ended\nOctober 28,\nOctober 29,\n(Dollars in millions)\nShares repurchased\n1,821,426\n1,470,099\nTotal cost of shares repurchased, including excise tax\n$\n848.4\n$\n571.9\nCredit facility\nOn February 27, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (as so amended, the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder; Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Syndication Agent and a Lender; PNC Bank, National Association,\nas Documentation Agent and a Lender; and the other lenders party thereto. The Loan Agreement matures on March 11, 2025, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $1.0 billion or a percentage of eligible owned inventory and eligible owned receivables (which borrowing base may, at the election of the Company and satisfaction of certain conditions, include a percentage of qualified cash), contains a $50.0 million subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $100.0 million, subject to the consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 during such periods when availability under the Loan Agreement falls below a specified threshold. Substantially all of the Companys assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreement. Outstanding borrowings bear interest, at the Companys election, at either a base rate plus a margin of 0% to 0.125% or the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.250%, and a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, with such margins based on the Companys borrowing availability, and the unused line fee is 0.20% per annum.\nAs of October 28, 2023, we had $195.4 million outstanding under the credit facility and the weighted average interest rate was 8.21%. As of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility.\nAs of October 28, 2023, we were in compliance with all terms and covenants of the Loan Agreement.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mothers Day and Valentines Day. Any decrease in sales during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023.\nItem 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nMarket risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nInterest rate risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risks primarily through borrowings under our credit facility. Interest on our borrowings is based upon variable rates. We had $195.4 million outstanding on the credit facility as of October 28, 2023. We did not have any outstanding borrowings on the credit facility as of January 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022.\nA hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates on variable rate debt would have increased interest expense for the 39 weeks ended October 28, 2023 by approximately $0.04 million.\nItem 4.Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to the members of our senior management and Board of Directors.\nBased on managements evaluation as of October 28, 2023, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nThere were no changes to our internal controls over financial reporting during the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1.Legal Proceedings\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, Commitments and contingencies, for information on legal proceedings. Item 1A.Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, financial results, or future performance. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2023.  Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThe following table sets forth repurchases of our common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2023:\nPeriod\nTotal number\nof shares\npurchased (1)\nAverage\nprice paid\nper share\nTotal number\nof shares\npurchased as\npart of publicly\nannounced\nplans or\nprograms\nApproximate\ndollar value of\nshares that may yet\nbe purchased\nunder plans or programs\n(in thousands)\nJuly 30, 2023 to August 26, 2023\n157,996\n$\n445.62\n157,960\n$\n471,262\nAugust 27, 2023 to September 23, 2023\n294,931\n416.89\n294,489\n349,768\nSeptember 24, 2023 to October 28, 2023\n235,191\n389.25\n234,240\n259,417\n13 weeks ended October 28, 2023\n688,118\n414.04\n686,689\n259,417\n(1) There were 686,689 shares repurchased as part of our publicly announced share repurchase program during the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and there were 1,429 shares transferred from employees in satisfaction of minimum statutory tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock during the period. Item 3.Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone Item 4.Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone Item 5.Other Information\nDuring the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
