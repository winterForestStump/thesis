    "content": "Item 1.BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Companys primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.\nSegments of Business\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of Business and Geographic Areas of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nConsumer Health\nThe Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter medicines, Baby Care, Oral Care, Womens Health and Wound Care markets.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedical Devices\nThe Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery offerings (Ethicon), solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE\u00ae Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics. Beginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech segment.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under - Segments of Business - Consumer Health, - Pharmaceutical and - Medical Devices. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Companys subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and\nclaims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings-Intellectual Property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Companys largest product, STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA\u00ae. The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Companys second largest product, collectively DARZALEX\u00ae (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two patent families related to DARZALEX\u00ae, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae.\nTrademarks\nThe Companys subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Companys product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Companys compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Companys businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Companys subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare generally.\nU.S. government actors continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACAs individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the number of employees were approximately:\n2021 2020\nEmployees1\n144,300 136,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2\n141,700 134,500\n1Employee is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance. The Companys human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Companys Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2021, 91% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Voice Survey which was offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each persons unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Companys long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2021, 45.8% of employees in Manager and above job categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 8%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Companys DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\nAccelerate the Companys efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Companys investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances for total health-physical, mental, emotional and financial-help ensure employee health protection from emerging health risks.\nSafety and COVID-19 Pandemic Response\nProtecting and supporting our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our approach includes: keeping employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and corresponding risk levels; promoting the health and safety of our employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with pay continuity, benefits and well-being tools; and recognizing extraordinary employee contributions at work and in our communities. In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working, we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers our office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work. This model allows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of workplaces and is enabled by an array of enhanced collaboration tools and technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in fourth quarter 2021 globally, and will continue deployment through 2022 as protocol and requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic allow. The Company is evaluating flexible work strategies for its on-site workforce, such as virtual on-boarding and training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also, we continued to enhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools, on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support resources and delivery of at-home testing kits. In addition, as COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered in 2021, including the one developed by Johnson & Johnson, we adopted policies in the U.S., Puerto Rico, and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from Johnson & Johnson employees and contingent workers, in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local law and regulation. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico, this requirement took effect on October 4, 2021, with processes established for granting accommodations to those with medical or religious needs. Select manufacturing and distribution employees and contractors in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as certain additional countries, are adopting similar policies through early 2022.\nAvailable Information\nThe Companys main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Companys common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Companys control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Companys other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Companys businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Companys earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Companys businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Companys existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Companys Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Companys Medical Devices businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Companys products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Companys Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Companys business, sales and reputation.\nThe Companys manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Companys subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from thousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Companys intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to facilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties, is unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\nCompany would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured - often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites - as well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industrys failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Companys business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Companys employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Companys future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Companys operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Companys business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy, safety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors section and those incorporated by reference herein, including risks relating to the Companys effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Companys products. Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Companys Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Companys Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Companys products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Companys more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\u00ae Baby Powder, and the Companys sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Companys products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Companys products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Companys operating results.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, could negatively impact the Companys effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8, Income Taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Companys expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Companys businesses and materially important to the Companys results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Companys owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the at-risk launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Companys patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, Legal Proceedings-Intellectual Property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Companys innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Companys long-term success.\nThe Companys continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful\nproducts and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Companys existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to: discern patients and healthcare providers future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Companys products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting business internationally.\nThe Companys extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial, economic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange: In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Companys sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Companys revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Companys non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Companys operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Companys sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Companys business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\ntherefore, the Companys interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other limitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Companys ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Companys foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\nThe planned separation of the Companys Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Companys Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee representative bodies, as required, final approval of the Companys Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable opinion and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances.\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the Companys Consumer Health business.\nThe Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Companys common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock, and the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of shares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Companys common stock may be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company intends to obtain an opinion from its U.S. tax advisors and a ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling will be based on, among other things, various factual assumptions and representations that the Company and the New Consumer Health Company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the transaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an influence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in loss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Companys business or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Companys supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Companys sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Companys third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely\nimpacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to the Companys business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance obligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such requirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our reputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy enforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are required to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company and involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border data flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact our business operations and research activities. Item 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. Item 2.PROPERTIES\nThe Company's subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities occupying approximately 15.0 million square feet of floor space.

Item 6. Reserved Item 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOrganization and Business Segments\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Womens Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the world. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Companys success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Companys consumer products involves significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nManagements Objectives\nWith Our Credo as the foundation, the Companys purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to ensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is poised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it competes.\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high quality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. In 2021, $14.7 billion was invested in research and development reflecting managements commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nA critical driver of the Companys success is the diversity of its 141,700 employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and inspired to lead with the Companys Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the Companys reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders.\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2021, worldwide sales increased 13.6% to $93.8 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2020. These sales changes consisted of the following:\nSales increase/(decrease) due to: 2021 2020\nVolume 12.9 % 3.5 %\nPrice (0.7) (2.3)\nCurrency 1.4 (0.6)\nTotal 13.6 % 0.6 %\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021 and a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020.\nSales by U.S. companies were $47.2 billion in 2021 and $43.1 billion in 2020. This represents increases of 9.3% in 2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This represents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0% and 2.6%, respectively.\nIn 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth of 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of 2.7%.\nThe Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the 2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2021 were $14.6 billion, an increase of 4.1% from 2020, which included 2.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.3%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.5 billion, an increase of 2.4%. International sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of 5.6%, which included 3.1% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.5%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 1.0% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment.\nMajor Consumer Health Franchise Sales:\n% Change\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 21 vs. 20\nOTC $ 5,227 4,824 8.4 %\nSkin Health/Beauty 4,541 4,450 2.0\nOral Care 1,645 1,641 0.2\nBaby Care 1,566 1,517 3.2\nWomens Health 917 901 1.8\nWound Care/Other 739 720 2.6\nTotal Consumer Health Sales $ 14,635 14,053 4.1 %\nThe OTC franchise sales of $5.2 billion increased 8.4% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to Analgesics, TYLENOL\u00ae and MOTRIN\u00ae, digestive health and the hydration benefit offering (ORSL).\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.5 billion increased 2.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily due to COVID-19 recovery, strong performance of NEUTROGENA\u00ae and AVEENO\u00ae, and eCommerce acceleration partially offset by the divestiture of DR. CI:LABO - Sedona business in Asia Pacific and external supply constraints.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Market growth in the U.S. along with strong performance in the Asia Pacific region due to successful brand building and promotional campaigns and the positive impact of currency offset the negative impact of the floss divestiture and U.S. external supply constraints.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 3.2% compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by AVEENO\u00ae Asia Pacific eCommerce strength, innovation and COVID-19 recovery.\nThe Womens Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion increased 1.8% as compared to the prior year primarily driven by COVID-19 market recovery, favorable price and strong brand building in Asia Pacific partially offset by disruptions in Europe due to flooding.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales of $0.7 billion increased 2.6% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of BAND-AID\u00ae Brand Adhesive Bandages in the U.S. partially offset by product discontinuations and competitive pressures in Asia Pacific.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Companys Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2021 were $52.1 billion, an increase of 14.3% from 2020, which included operational growth of 13.1% and a positive currency impact of 1.2%. U.S. sales were $28.0 billion, an increase of 8.6%. International sales were $24.1 billion, an increase of 21.6%, which included 18.8% operational growth and a positive currency impact of 2.8%. In 2021, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.5% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous sales reserve estimates were approximately $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMajor Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:\n% Change\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 21 vs. 20\nTotal Immunology $ 16,750 15,055 11.3 %\nREMICADE\u00ae\n3,190 3,747 (14.9)\nSIMPONI\u00ae/SIMPONI ARIA\u00ae\n2,276 2,243 1.4\nSTELARA\u00ae\n9,134 7,707 18.5\nTREMFYA\u00ae\n2,127 1,347 57.9\nOther Immunology 24 11 **\nTotal Infectious Diseases 5,861 3,574 64.0\nCOVID-19 VACCINE 2,385 - **\nEDURANT\u00ae/rilpivirine\n994 964 3.1\nPREZISTA\u00ae/ PREZCOBIX\u00ae/REZOLSTA\u00ae/SYMTUZA\u00ae\n2,083 2,184 (4.6)\nOther Infectious Diseases 399 427 (6.5)\nTotal Neuroscience 7,011 6,548 7.1\nCONCERTA\u00ae/methylphenidate\n667 622 7.3\nINVEGA SUSTENNA\u00ae/XEPLION\u00ae/INVEGA TRINZA\u00ae/TREVICTA\u00ae\n4,022 3,653 10.1\nRISPERDAL CONSTA\u00ae\n592 642 (7.7)\nOther Neuroscience 1,729 1,632 6.0\nTotal Oncology 14,548 12,367 17.6\nDARZALEX\u00ae\n6,023 4,190 43.8\nERLEADA\u00ae\n1,291 760 70.0\nIMBRUVICA\u00ae\n4,369 4,128 5.8\nZYTIGA\u00ae /abiraterone acetate\n2,297 2,470 (7.0)\nOther Oncology(1)\n568 821 (30.8)\nTotal Pulmonary Hypertension 3,450 3,148 9.6\nOPSUMIT\u00ae\n1,819 1,639 11.0\nUPTRAVI\u00ae\n1,237 1,093 13.1\nOther Pulmonary Hypertension 395 416 (5.0)\nTotal Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other 4,460 4,878 (8.6)\nXARELTO\u00ae\n2,438 2,345 4.0\nINVOKANA\u00ae/ INVOKAMET\u00ae\n563 795 (29.3)\nPROCRIT\u00ae/EPREX\u00ae\n479 552 (13.3)\nOther 981 1,186 (17.3)\nTotal Pharmaceutical Sales $ 52,080 45,572 14.3 %\n*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n** Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful\n(1) Inclusive of VELCADE\u00ae which was previously disclosed separately\nImmunology products achieved sales of $16.8 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 11.3% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA\u00ae (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of REMICADE\u00ae (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE\u00ae have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE\u00ae.\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA\u00ae and PREZCOBIX\u00ae/REZOLSTA\u00ae (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA\u00ae in certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA\u00ae/XEPLION\u00ae (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA\u00ae/TREVICTA\u00ae from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA\u2122.\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX\u00ae (daratumumab) driven by continued strong market growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the continued global launch uptake of ERLEADA\u00ae (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA\u00ae (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by market and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA\u00ae (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive pressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT\u00ae (macitentan) and UPTRAVI\u00ae (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA\u00ae/INVOKAMET\u00ae (canagliflozin) due to share erosion and PROCRIT\u00ae/ EPREX\u00ae (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\nDuring 2021, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name (Chemical Name) Indication US Approval EU Approval US Filing EU Filing\nBYANNLI\u00ae\nMaintenance Treatment of Schizophrenia in Adults\nCABENUVA (rilpivirine and cabotegravir) HIV treatment for use every two months\nCOVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 Emergency Use\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shot COVID-19 Emergency Use\nDARZALEX\u00ae (daratumumab)\nSubcutaneous (SC) formulation Treatment for Newly Diagnosed Systemic Light Chain Amyloidosis and Gains an Additional Approval in Pre-Treated Multiple Myeloma\nDARZALEX FASPRO\u00ae (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj)\nCombination with Carfilzomib and Dexamethasone for Patients with Multiple Myeloma After First or Subsequent Relapse\nINVEGA HAFYERA (paliperidone palmitate) First and Only Twice-Yearly Treatment for Adults with Schizophrenia\nPONVORY (Ponesimod) Treatment of Adults with Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis with Active Disease Defined by Clinical or Imaging Features\nPONVORY (Ponesimod) Oral Treatment for Adults with Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis\nRYBREVANT (amivantamab-vmjw) Treatment for Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations\nSPRAVATO\u00ae (esketamine)\nRapid reduction of depressive symptoms in a psychiatric emergency for patients with major depressive disorder\nSTELARA\u00ae (ustekinumab)\nTreatment of Pediatric Patients with Juvenille Psoriatic Arthritis\nTeclistamab Treatment of Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma\nUPTRAVI\u00ae\n(selexipag)\nIntravenous Use in Adult Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)\nXARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban)\nHelp Prevent and Treat Blood Clots in Pediatric Patients\nXARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban)\nExpanded Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Indication to Include Patients After Lower-Extremity Revascularization (LER)\nMedical Devices Segment\nThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2021 were $27.1 billion, an increase of 17.9% from 2020, which included operational growth of 16.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.7%. U.S. sales were $12.7 billion, an increase of 14.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $14.4 billion, an increase of 20.6% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 17.3% and a positive currency impact of 3.3%. In 2021, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.6% primarily due to the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP). The Company has seen a market recovery in global procedural volumes in the Medical Devices segment as compared to the prior year which had significant negative impacts from COVID-19. This procedural volume recovery is the primary driver of sales and earnings growth as compared to the prior year.\nMajor Medical Devices Franchise Sales:\n% Change\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 21 vs. 20\nSurgery $ 9,812 8,232 19.2 %\nAdvanced 4,622 3,839 20.4\nGeneral 5,190 4,392 18.1\nOrthopaedics 8,588 7,763 10.6\nHips 1,485 1,280 16.0\nKnees 1,325 1,170 13.3\nTrauma 2,885 2,614 10.4\nSpine, Sports & Other 2,893 2,699 7.2\nVision 4,688 3,919 19.6\nContact Lenses/Other 3,440 2,994 14.9\nSurgical 1,248 925 34.9\nInterventional Solutions\n3,971 3,046 30.4\nTotal Medical Devices Sales $ 27,060 22,959 17.9 %\nThe Surgery franchise achieved sales of $9.8 billion in 2021 representing an increase of 19.2% from 2020. The growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by Endocutter, Biosurgery and Energy products attributable to market recovery, market expansion and the success of new products offsetting competitive pressures in the U.S. The growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and the continued strength of the suture portfolio partially offset by the impact of the ASP divestiture in the prior year.\nThe Orthopaedics franchise achieved sales of $8.6 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 10.6% from 2020. The growth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS\u00ae stem and enabling technologies - KINCISE\u2122 and VELYS\u2122 Hip Navigation.

These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products.\nResearch and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:\nGeneral portfolio progression in the Pharmaceutical business\nCOVID-19 vaccine expenses, net of governmental reimbursements\nIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The Company will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program activities are ongoing. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition.\nOn January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, income and losses associated with certain employee benefit programs, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.\nOther (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2021 was favorable by $2.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:\n(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense 2021 2020 Change\nLitigation expense(1)\n$ 2.3 5.1 (2.8)\nAcquisition, Integration and Divestiture related(2)\n(0.5) (1.1) 0.6\n(Gains)/losses on securities (0.5) (0.5) 0.0\nRestructuring related 0.1 0.1 0.0\nEmployee benefit plan related (0.6) (0.4) (0.2)\nOther(3)\n(0.3) (0.3) -\nTotal Other (Income) Expense, Net $ 0.5 2.9 (2.4)\n(1)2021 is primarily related to talc and Risperdal. 2020 is primarily related to talc and the opioid litigation settlement.\n(2)2021 is primarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S.\n2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition.\n(3)2021 includes Consumer Health separation costs of $0.1 billion. Costs in future years are expected to be significantly higher.\nInterest (Income) Expense: The fiscal year 2021 included net interest expense of $130 million as compared to $90 million net interest expense in the fiscal year 2020. This was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance, partially offset by the benefit from net investment hedging. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.6 billion at the end of 2021, and averaged $28.4 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $25.2 billion and $22.2 billion average cash balance in 2020. The total debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion with an average debt balance of $34.5 billion as compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2020 and an average debt balance of $31.5 billion.\nIncome Before Tax by Segment\nIncome (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows:\nIncome Before Tax Segment Sales Percent of Segment Sales\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nConsumer Health $ 1,294 (1,064) 14,635 14,053 8.8 % (7.6)\nPharmaceutical 18,181 15,462 52,080 45,572 34.9 33.9\nMedical Devices 4,373 3,044 27,060 22,959 16.2 13.3\nTotal (1)\n23,848 17,442 93,775 82,584 25.4 21.1\nLess: Net expense not allocated to segments (2)\n1,072 945\nEarnings before provision for taxes on income $ 22,776 16,497 93,775 82,584 24.3 % 20.0\n(1)See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(2)Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.\nConsumer Health Segment:\nIn 2021, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 8.8% versus a loss before tax of 7.6% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\n2021 litigation expense includes $1.6 billion of talc expenses; 2020 includes $3.9 billion of talc expenses\nSupply chain efficiencies\npartially offset by:\nIncreased brand marketing expenses and commodity inflation\nPharmaceutical Segment:\nIn 2021, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 34.9% versus 33.9% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\nDivestiture gains of $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S. in fiscal 2021\n2021 litigation expense includes $0.6 billion primarily related to Risperdal; 2020 includes $0.8 billion primarily related to the opioid litigation settlement\npartially offset by:\nResearch & Development investment in the COVID-19 vaccine net of governmental reimbursements and general portfolio progression\nMedical Devices Segment: In 2021, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.2% versus 13.3% in 2020. The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\nRecovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts\nOverall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery\nLitigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020\npartially offset by:\nA contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition\nA higher IPR&D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019)\nRestructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$ 14.0 Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n23.4 cash generated from operating activities\n(8.7) net cash used by investing activities\n(14.0) net cash used by financing activities\n(0.2) effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$ 14.5 Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $17.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $11.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2020. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nCash flow from operations of $23.4 billion was the result of:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$ 20.9 Net Earnings\n6.8 non-cash expenses and other adjustments primarily for depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset write-downs partially offset by the deferred tax provision, net gain on sale of assets/businesses and credit losses and accounts receivable allowances\n(1.1) a decrease in current and non-current liabilities\n2.4 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities\n(5.6) an increase in accounts receivable, inventories and other current and non-current assets\n$ 23.4 Cash Flow from operations\nInvesting activities use of $8.7 billion of cash was primarily used for:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$ (3.7) additions to property, plant and equipment\n(5.4) net purchases of investments\n0.7 proceeds from the disposal of assets/businesses, net\n0.2 Credit support agreements activity, net\n(0.1) acquisitions\n(0.4) other (primarily licenses and milestones) and rounding\n$ (8.7) Net cash used for investing activities\nFinancing activities use of $14.0 billion of cash was primarily used for:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$ (11.0) dividends to shareholders\n(3.5) repurchase of common stock for employee share programs\n(1.0) net repayment from short and long term debt\n1.0 proceeds from stock options exercised/employee withholding tax on stock awards, net\n0.3 Credit support agreements activity, net\n0.2 other and rounding\n$ (14.0) Net cash used for financing activities\nAs of January 2, 2022, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid litigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the U.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a deferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and therefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The requirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is not affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of\n2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 2, 2022: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\n(Dollars in Millions) Tax Legislation (TCJA) Debt Obligations Interest on\nDebt Obligations Total\n2022 $ 812 2,131 909 3,852\n2023 1,522 1,551 893 3,966\n2024 2,029 1,518 843 4,390\n2025 2,536 1,732 789 5,057\n2026 - 1,995 744 2,739\nAfter 2026 - 23,189 8,786 31,975\nTotal $ 6,899 32,116 12,964 51,979\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Companys approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Companys forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Companys interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Companys swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Companys interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was due to the repayment of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt represented 31.3% of total capital (shareholders equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders equity per share at the end of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagements discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Companys consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Companys operating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Companys business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022, the Companys future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Companys consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in\nsales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(Dollars in Millions) Balance at\nBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance at\nEnd of Period\nAccrued rebates (1)\n$ 289 893 (895) 287\nAccrued returns 76 136 (136) 76\nAccrued promotions 428 1,958 (1,999) 387\nSubtotal $ 793 2,987 (3,030) 750\nReserve for doubtful accounts 39 0 (7) 32\nReserve for cash discounts 12 213 (210) 15\nTotal $ 844 3,200 (3,247) 797\nAccrued rebates(1)\n$ 284 793 (788) 289\nAccrued returns 63 138 (125) 76\nAccrued promotions 487 1,988 (2,047) 428\nSubtotal $ 834 2,919 (2,960) 793\nReserve for doubtful accounts 35 7 (3) 39\nReserve for cash discounts 17 201 (206) 12\nTotal $ 886 3,127 (3,169) 844\n(1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $80 million at January 2, 2022 and $66 million at January 3, 2021, recorded as a contra asset.\nPharmaceutical Segment\n(Dollars in Millions) Balance at\nBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits(2)\nBalance at\nEnd of Period\nAccrued rebates (1)\n$ 9,837 37,922 (37,428) 10,331\nAccrued returns 460 345 (285) 520\nAccrued promotions 6 13 (16) 3\nSubtotal 10,303 38,280 (37,729) 10,854\nReserve for doubtful accounts 52 18 (20) 50\nReserve for cash discounts 70 1,163 (1,139) 94\nTotal 10,425 39,461 (38,888) 10,998\nAccrued rebates (1)\n$ 9,013 32,415 (31,591) 9,837\nAccrued returns 500 233 (273) 460\nAccrued promotions 5 10 (9) 6\nSubtotal $ 9,518 32,658 (31,873) 10,303\nReserve for doubtful accounts 36 24 (8) 52\nReserve for cash discounts 65 1,034 (1,029) 70\nTotal $ 9,619 33,716 (32,910) 10,425\n(1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $218 million at January 2, 2022 and $174 million at January 3, 2021, recorded as a contra asset.\n(2)Includes prior period adjustments\nMedical Devices Segment\n(Dollars in Millions) Balance at\nBeginning of Period Accruals Payments/Credits Balance at\nEnd of Period\nAccrued rebates(1)\n$ 1,174 5,942 (5,670) 1,446\nAccrued returns 138 559 (563) 134\nAccrued promotions 52 140 (138) 54\nSubtotal 1,364 6,641 (6,371) 1,634\nReserve for doubtful accounts 202 12 (66) 148\nReserve for cash discounts 9 96 (95) 10\nTotal 1,575 6,749 (6,532) 1,792\nAccrued rebates(1)\n$ 1,013 5,144 (4,983) 1,174\nAccrued returns 118 578 (558) 138\nAccrued promotions 46 118 (112) 52\nSubtotal $ 1,177 5,840 (5,653) 1,364\nReserve for doubtful accounts 155 95 (48) 202\nReserve for cash discounts 10 88 (89) 9\nTotal $ 1,342 6,023 (5,790) 1,575\n(1)Includes reserve for customer rebates of $845 million at January 2, 2022 and $707 million at January 3, 2021, recorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on managements judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Companys property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 2, 2022.\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\nOperating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\nSupply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to help ensure adequate and effective distribution.\nBusiness Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.\nWorkforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees.\nLiquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future.\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys operations.\nIn fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.\nThe Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its contract with Emergent BioSolutions and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The Company has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across different countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site, or the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or results.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Companys net price increases for healthcare products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2 billion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of healthcare products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Companys key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information regarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Companys Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2022, there were 127,899 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.

Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Womens Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Companys Consumer Health business, with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 2, 2022\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\nASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to alternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of 2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and other market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of observable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial reporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any hedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR where applicable). The company also applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that previously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform provisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have\nat least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment 20 - 30 years\nLand and leasehold improvements 10 - 20 years\nMachinery and equipment 2 - 13 years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3 to 8 years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the assets fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion and $7.2 billion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Companys sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the\nMedical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposures impact on the Companys financial performance; (2) protect the Companys cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach\non leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Companys operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit share payments received Sales to customers\nRoyalties/milestones paid to collaborative partner (post-regulatory approval)* Cost of products sold\nRoyalties received from collaborative partner Other income (expense), net\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to collaborative partner (pre-regulatory approval) Research and development expense\nResearch and development payments to collaborative partner Research and development expense\nResearch and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity Reduction of Research and development expense\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO\u00ae, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA\u00ae, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX\u00ae, licensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $2.7 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2021 was approximately $6.9 billion, of which $6.1 billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as Long-term taxes payable on the Companys balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholders total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., period cost) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., deferred method). The Company has elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates. This amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this cost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Companys business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Companys allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets along with the Companys on-going vaccine development and distribution efforts. While there was not a material impact to the Companys consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, the Companys future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Companys consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n2.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Securities\nAt the end of the fiscal year 2021 and 2020, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised of:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021\nCarrying Amount Unrecognized Loss Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities\nCash $ 2,936 - 2,936 2,936 -\nNon-U.S. Sovereign Securities(1)\n1,006 - 1,006 90 916\nU.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 1,659 - 1,659 1,659 -\nCorporate debt securities(1)\n3,479 (1) 3,478 200 3,279\nMoney market funds 1,901 - 1,901 1,901 -\nTime deposits(1)\n900 - 900 900 -\nSubtotal $ 11,881 (1) 11,880 7,686 4,195\nU.S. Gov't Securities $ 19,485 (4) 19,481 6,785 12,696\nOther Sovereign Securities 1 - 1 1 -\nCorporate debt securities 245 - 245 15 230\nSubtotal available for sale(2)\n$ 19,731 (4) 19,727 6,801 12,926\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 14,487 17,121\n(Dollars in Millions) 2020\nCarrying Amount Unrecognized Gain Estimated Fair Value Cash & Cash Equivalents Current Marketable Securities\nCash $ 2,863 - 2,863 2,863 -\nNon-U.S. Sovereign Securities(1)\n690 - 690 - 690\nU.S. Reverse repurchase agreements 1,937 - 1,937 1,937 -\nCorporate debt securities(1)\n2,674 - 2,674 1,451 1,223\nMoney market funds 2,102 - 2,102 2,102 -\nTime deposits(1)\n877 - 877 877 -\nSubtotal $ 11,143 - 11,143 9,230 1,913\nGov't Securities $ 13,777 1 13,778 4,731 9,047\nOther Sovereign Securities 14 - 14 - 14\nCorporate debt securities 250 - 250 24 226\nSubtotal available for sale(2)\n$ 14,041 1 14,042 4,755 9,287\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities $ 13,985 11,200\n(1) Held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings.\n(2) Available for sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in other comprehensive income.\nFair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe contractual maturities of the available for sale debt securities at January 2, 2022 are as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions) Cost Basis Fair Value\nDue within one year $ 19,709 19,705\nDue after one year through five years 22 22\nDue after five years through ten years - -\nTotal debt securities $ 19,731 19,727\nThe Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\n3.Inventories\nAt the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, inventories were comprised of:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020\nRaw materials and supplies $ 1,592 1,410\nGoods in process 2,287 2,040\nFinished goods 6,508 5,894\nTotal inventories $ 10,387 9,344\n4.Property, Plant and Equipment\nAt the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020\nLand and land improvements $ 884 882\nBuildings and building equipment 12,882 12,502\nMachinery and equipment 29,774 29,104\nConstruction in progress 4,139 4,316\nTotal property, plant and equipment, gross $ 47,679 46,804\nLess accumulated depreciation 28,717 28,038\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net(1)\n$ 18,962 18,766\nThe Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $49 million, $63 million and $70 million, respectively.\nDepreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $2.7 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\nUpon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings.\n5.Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nAt the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020\nIntangible assets with definite lives:\nPatents and trademarks - gross $ 38,572 39,990\nLess accumulated amortization (20,088) (17,618)\nPatents and trademarks - net $ 18,484 22,372\nCustomer relationships and other intangibles - gross $ 23,011 22,898\nLess accumulated amortization (11,925) (10,912)\nCustomer relationships and other intangibles - net(1)\n$ 11,086 11,986\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives:\nTrademarks $ 6,985 7,195\nPurchased in-process research and development(2)\n9,837 11,849\nTotal intangible assets with indefinite lives $ 16,822 19,044\nTotal intangible assets - net $ 46,392 53,402\n(1)The majority is comprised of customer relationships\n(2)In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was calculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human procedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The remaining reduction was driven by assets that reached commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives.\nGoodwill as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions) Consumer Health Pharmaceutical Medical Devices Total\nGoodwill at December 29, 2019 $ 9,736 9,169 14,734 33,639\nGoodwill, related to acquisitions - 1,222 238 1,460\nCurrency translation/other 600 618 76 1,294\nGoodwill at January 3, 2021 $ 10,336 11,009 15,048 36,393\nGoodwill, related to acquisitions - - - -\nGoodwill, related to divestitures (9) - - (9)\nCurrency translation/other (517) (429) (192) (1,138)\nGoodwill at January 2, 2022 $ 9,810 10,580 14,856 35,246\nThe weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is 12 years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is 21 years. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in Cost of products sold was $4.7 billion, $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.\nThe estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately:\n(Dollars in Millions)\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026\n$4,600 4,600 4,400 3,600 3,000\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n6.Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of January 2, 2022, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $570 million net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $45.8 billion, $37.4 billion and $10.0 billion, respectively. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $37.8 billion and $30.6 billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $336 million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is 18 months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, net of tax:\nJanuary 2, 2022 January 3, 2021\n(Dollars in Millions) Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense Sales Cost of Products Sold R&D Expense Interest (Income) Expense Other (Income) Expense\nThe effects of fair value, net investment and cash flow hedging:\nGain (Loss) on fair value hedging relationship:\nInterest rate swaps contracts:\nHedged items $ - - - (109) - - - - - -\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments - - - 109 - - - - - -\nGain (Loss) on net investment hedging relationship:\nCross currency interest rate swaps contracts:\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in income on derivative amount excluded from effectiveness testing $ - - - 174 - - - - 153 -\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI - - - 174 - - - - 153 -\nGain (Loss) on cash flow hedging relationship:\nForward foreign exchange contracts:\nAmount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income 17 119 30 - 47 12 (329) (137) - (16)\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI (94) (557) 123 - 146 44 298 (91) - (52)\nCross currency interest rate swaps contracts:\nAmount of gain or (loss) reclassified from AOCI into income - - - 402 - - - - 370 -\nAmount of gain or (loss) recognized in AOCI $ - - - 9 - - - - 748 -\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\nLine item in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in which the hedged item is included Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Amount of the Hedged Liability\n(Dollars in Millions) January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021\nLong-term Debt $ 9,793 $ - $ (142) $ -\nThe following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021:\n(Dollars in Millions) Location of Gain /(Loss) Recognized in Income on Derivative Gain/(Loss)\nRecognized In\nIncome on Derivative\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021\nForeign Exchange Contracts Other (income) expense $ (70) 24\nThe following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021:\nGain/(Loss)\nRecognized In\nAccumulated OCI Location of Gain or (Loss) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Into Income Gain/(Loss) Reclassified From\nAccumulated OCI\nInto Income\n(Dollars in Millions) January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021 January 2, 2022 January 3, 2021\nDebt $ 387 (473) Interest (income) expense\n- -\nCross Currency interest rate swaps $ 548 65 Interest (income) expense - -\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company measures equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021:\nJanuary 3, 2021 January 2, 2022\n(Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1)\nSales/ Purchases/Other(2)\nCarrying Value Non Current Other Assets\nEquity Investments with readily determinable value $ 1,481 198 205 1,884 1,884\nEquity Investments without readily determinable value $ 738 394 (632) 500 500\nDecember 29, 2019 January 3, 2021\n(Dollars in Millions) Carrying Value Changes in Fair Value Reflected in Net Income (1)\nSales/ Purchases/Other(2)\nCarrying Value Non Current Other Assets\nEquity Investments with readily determinable value $ 1,148 527 (194) 1,481 1,481\nEquity Investments without readily determinable value $ 712 (55) 81 738 738\n(1) Recorded in Other Income/Expense\n(2) Other includes impact of currency\nFor the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $28 million and $76 million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were offsetting impacts of $422 million and $21 million, respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments. The impact in fiscal 2021 was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 - Significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Companys significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 were as follows:\n2021 2020\n(Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total (1)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts $ - 540 - 540 849\nInterest rate contracts (2)\n- 796 - 796 240\nTotal $ - 1,336 - 1,336 1,089\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts - 881 - 881 702\nInterest rate contracts (2)\n- 979 - 979 1,569\nTotal $ - 1,860 - 1,860 2,271\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts $ - 24 - 24 49\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts - 28 - 28 38\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(3)\n1,884 - - 1,884 1,481\nDebt securities(4)\n- 19,727 - 19,727 14,042\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(5)\n$ 533 533 633\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation 2021 2020\n(Dollars in Millions)\nTotal Gross Assets $ 1,360 1,138\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA) (1,285) (1,107)\nTotal Net Asset 75 31\nTotal Gross Liabilities 1,888 2,309\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA) (1,855) (2,172)\nTotal Net Liabilities $ 33 137\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n2021 2020 2019\n(Dollars in Millions)\nBeginning Balance $ 633 1,715 397\nChanges in estimated fair value (6)\n(52) (1,089) 151\nAdditions - 106 1,246\nPayments (48) (99) (79)\nEnding Balance $ 533 633 1,715\n(1)2020 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $1,481 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $633 million, classified as Level 3.\n(2)Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3)Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4)Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5)Includes $520 million, $594 million and $1,631 million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively.

Further information provided below.\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $0.6 billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Companys annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\napproximately $2.3 billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these assets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $1.7 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as U.S. tax on international income on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which is reflected as a Tax benefits from loss on capital assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $1.6 billion for talc at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and $0.8 billion for Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4% (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., step-up) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development\ntax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., step-up) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $0.4 billion or 2.6% benefit to the Companys annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\napproximately $0.3 billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $450 million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Companys Swiss subsidiaries assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $0.3 billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as U.S. tax on international income on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which is reflected as a Tax benefits from loss on capital assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $4.0 billion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $1.0 billion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18) and reversed of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $0.6 billion and a related deferred tax asset of $0.2 billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $0.4 billion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as TCJA and related impacts on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation. The following items also impacted the fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate:\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $4 billion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5% and decreased the Companys annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1%.\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $0.3 billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has been reflected as TCJA and related impacts on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $0.3 billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately 1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAs described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $0.1 billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions:\napproximately $0.6 billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $0.9 billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Companys Swiss subsidiaries assets; this benefit has been reflected as International Operations on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $450 million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as U.S. tax on international income on the Companys effective tax rate reconciliation.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n2021 Deferred Tax 2020 Deferred Tax(1)\n(Dollars in Millions) Asset Liability Asset Liability\nEmployee related obligations $ 1,244 2,434\nStock based compensation 679 627\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment (876) (823)\nGoodwill and intangibles (2,659) (2)\n(5,023)\nR&D capitalized for tax 1,664 1,517\nReserves & liabilities 2,882 3,466\nIncome reported for tax purposes 2,566 1,777\nNet realizable operating loss carryforward 1,073 990\nUndistributed foreign earnings 1,015 (1,461) 812 (1,435)\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income (4,853) (3,606)\nMiscellaneous international 1,006 (39) 854 (211)\nMiscellaneous U.S. 495 (59)\nTotal deferred income taxes $ 12,624 (9,888) 12,477 (11,157)\n(1)Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n(2)Amount is inclusive of the $2.3 billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets. However, in certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. Such valuation allowances are not material.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2019\nBeginning of year $ 3,373 3,853 3,326\nIncreases related to current year tax positions 242 265 249\nIncreases related to prior period tax positions 23 668 408\nDecreases related to prior period tax positions (128) (551) (105)\nSettlements (187) (839) (9)\nLapse of statute of limitations 0 (23) (16)\nEnd of year $ 3,323 3,373 3,853\nThe unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 billion at January 2, 2022, if recognized, would affect the Companys annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately$0.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $44 million, $32 million and $50 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $512 million and $468 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n9.Employee Related Obligations\nAt the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020\nPension benefits $ 4,088 5,761\nPostretirement benefits 2,069 2,229\nPostemployment benefits 3,117 3,078\nDeferred compensation 181 250\nTotal employee obligations 9,455 11,318\nLess current benefits payable 557 547\nEmployee related obligations - non-current $ 8,898 10,771\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $4,436 million and $656 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n10.Pensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employees compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the\nProjected Benefit Obligation as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $1.8 billion and is included in the Amendments line in the Change in Benefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.\nIn 2021 and 2020 the Company used December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2021, 2020 and 2019 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nService cost $ 1,421 1,380 1,163 309 287 274\nInterest cost 770 955 1,096 81 133 185\nExpected return on plan assets (2,645) (2,461) (2,322) (7) (7) (6)\nAmortization of prior service cost (181) 2 4 (31) (31) (31)\nRecognized actuarial losses (gains) 1,257 891 579 151 142 129\nCurtailments and settlements 1 23 73 - - -\nNet periodic benefit cost $ 623 790 593 503 524 551\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold, Research and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net periodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement Plans Other Benefit Plans\nWorldwide Benefit Plans 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate 2.14 % 2.82 3.63 2.09 3.04 4.45\nInterest cost discount rate 2.34 % 3.13 4.13 2.33 3.08 4.25\nRate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 4.00 3.99 4.25 4.25 4.29\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets 7.71 % 8.12 8.31\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate 2.49 % 2.14 2.91 2.68 2.23 3.39\nRate of increase in compensation levels 4.01 % 4.00 4.01 4.21 4.27 4.29\nThe Companys discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\nThe expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.\nThe following table displays the assumed healthcare cost trend rates, for all individuals:\nHealthcare Plans 2021 2020\nHealthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year 5.33 % 5.68 %\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend) 3.73 % 4.49 %\nYear the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate 2046 2040\nThe following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at fiscal year-end 2021 and 2020 for the Companys defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans:\nRetirement Plans Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020\nChange in Benefit Obligation\nProjected benefit obligation - beginning of year $ 43,300 37,188 5,028 5,076\nService cost 1,421 1,380 309 287\nInterest cost 770 955 81 133\nPlan participant contributions 67 61 - -\nAmendments(1)\n5 (1,780) - -\nActuarial (gains) losses(2)\n(2,132) 5,716 (188) (75)\nDivestitures & acquisitions (2) (88) - -\nCurtailments, settlements & restructuring (7) (24) - -\nBenefits paid from plan (1,157) (1,111) (348) (396)\nEffect of exchange rates (683) 1,003 (4) 3\nProjected benefit obligation - end of year $ 41,582 43,300 4,878 5,028\nChange in Plan Assets\nPlan assets at fair value - beginning of year $ 38,195 32,201 90 115\nActual return on plan assets 4,439 5,524 17 14\nCompany contributions 969 870 343 357\nPlan participant contributions 67 61 - -\nSettlements (7) (13) - -\nDivestitures & acquisitions (2) (84) - -\nBenefits paid from plan assets (1,157) (1,111) (348) (396)\nEffect of exchange rates (574) 747 - -\nPlan assets at fair value - end of year $ 41,930 38,195 102 90\nFunded status - end of year $ 348 (5,105) (4,776) (4,938)\nAmounts Recognized in the Companys Balance Sheet consist of the following:\nNon-current assets $ 4,436 656 - -\nCurrent liabilities (115) (125) (438) (418)\nNon-current liabilities (3,973) (5,636) (4,338) (4,520)\nTotal recognized in the consolidated balance sheet - end of year $ 348 (5,105) (4,776) (4,938)\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income consist of the following:\nNet actuarial loss $ 5,539 10,860 1,113 1,463\nPrior service cost (credit)(1)\n(1,610) (1,797) (13) (44)\nUnrecognized net transition obligation - - - -\nTotal before tax effects $ 3,929 9,063 1,100 1,419\nAccumulated Benefit Obligations - end of year $ 39,049 40,356\n(1)In January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula.

International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded.\nIn 2021, the Company contributed $102 million and $867 million to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.\nThe following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively:\nU.S. Plans International Plans\nQualified Plans Non-Qualified Plans Funded Plans Unfunded Plans\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nPlan Assets $ 27,944 25,554 - - 13,986 12,641 - -\nProjected Benefit Obligation 25,041 25,466 2,703 2,748 13,428 14,541 410 545\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation 23,985 24,158 2,479 2,495 12,212 13,210 373 493\nOver (Under) Funded Status\nProjected Benefit Obligation $ 2,903 88 (2,703) (2,748) 558 (1,900) (410) (545)\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation 3,959 1,396 (2,479) (2,495) 1,774 (569) (373) (493)\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $3.9 billion, $4.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, at the end of 2021, and $8.8 billion, $9.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, at the end of 2020.\nThe following table displays the projected future benefit payments from the Companys retirement and other benefit plans:\n(Dollars in Millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027-2031\nProjected future benefit payments\nRetirement plans $ 1,317 1,386 1,421 1,496 1,572 9,279\nOther benefit plans $ 447 459 472 485 434 2,379\nThe following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the unfunded retirement plans.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors\nincluding, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Companys pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.\nThe Companys retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2021 and 2020 and target allocations for 2022 are as follows:\nPercent of\nPlan Assets Target\nAllocation\n2021 2020 2022\nWorldwide Retirement Plans\nEquity securities 65 % 66 % 61 %\nDebt securities 35 34 39\nTotal plan assets 100 % 100 % 100 %\nDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets\nThe Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instruments categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds - Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities - A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments - A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.\nEquity securities - Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds - These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\nOther assets - Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\nQuoted Prices\nin Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs(1)\nInvestments Measured at Net Asset Value\n(Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Total Assets\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020\nShort-term investment funds $ 102 127 1,033 763 - - - - 1,135 890\nGovernment and agency securities - - 7,016 5,023 - - - - 7,016 5,023\nDebt instruments - - 3,505 3,931 - - - - 3,505 3,931\nEquity securities 14,107 14,375 2 2 - - - - 14,109 14,377\nCommingled funds - - 5,496 4,690 105 160 8,708 8,236 14,309 13,086\nOther assets - - 34 11 15 21 1,807 856 1,856 888\nInvestments at fair value $ 14,209 14,502 17,086 14,420 120 181 10,515 9,092 41,930 38,195\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $102 million and $90 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $385 million (0.9% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021 and $946 million (2.5% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2020.\n11.Savings Plan\nThe Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employees contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $256 million, $243 million and $235 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n12.Capital and Treasury Stock\nChanges in treasury stock were:\nTreasury Stock\n(Amounts in Millions Except Treasury Stock Shares in Thousands) Shares Amount\nBalance at December 30, 2018 457,519 $ 34,362\nEmployee compensation and stock option plans (20,053) (2,691)\nRepurchase of common stock 49,870 6,746\nBalance at December 29, 2019 487,336 38,417\nEmployee compensation and stock option plans (21,765) (3,148)\nRepurchase of common stock 21,760 3,221\nBalance at January 3, 2021 487,331 38,490\nEmployee compensation and stock option plans (17,399) (2,847)\nRepurchase of common stock 20,946 3,456\nBalance at January 2, 2022 490,878 $ 39,099\nAggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately 3,119,843,000 shares at the end of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nCash dividends paid were $4.19 per share in fiscal year 2021, compared with dividends of $3.98 per share in fiscal year 2020, and $3.75 per share in fiscal year 2019.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8, 2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\nOn December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of September 29, 2019.\n13.Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComponents of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following:\n(Dollars in Millions) Foreign\nCurrency Translation Gain/(Loss) On Securities Employee Benefit Plans Gain/\n(Loss) On\nDerivatives & Hedges Total\nAccumulated\nOther\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nDecember 30, 2018 $ (8,869) - (6,158) (195) (15,222)\nNet 2019 changes 164 - (733) (100) (669)\nDecember 29, 2019 (8,705) - (6,891) (295) (15,891)\nNet 2020 changes (233) 1 (66) 947 649\nJanuary 3, 2021 (8,938) 1 (6,957) 652 (15,242)\nNet 2021 changes (1,079) (4) 4,255 (988) 2,184\nJanuary 2, 2022 $ (10,017) (3) (2,702) (336) (13,058)\nAmounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nDetails on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\nGain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net.\nEmployee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details.\nGain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction. See Note 6 for additional details.\n14.International Currency Translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $236 million, $209 million and $267 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n15.Earnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\n(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts) 2021 2020 2019\nBasic net earnings per share $ 7.93 5.59 5.72\nAverage shares outstanding - basic 2,632.1 2,632.8 2,645.1\nPotential shares exercisable under stock option plans 138.0 118.3 136.3\nLess: shares repurchased under treasury stock method (96.1) (80.4) (97.8)\nConvertible debt shares - - 0.7\nAdjusted average shares outstanding - diluted 2,674.0 2,670.7 2,684.3\nDiluted net earnings per share $ 7.81 5.51 5.63\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2021 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 2, 2022, the Company did not have convertible debt.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18 million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company's stock. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Companys stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $1 million after-tax.\n16.Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 2, 2022, the Company had 2 stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650 million shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 240 million at the end of fiscal year 2021.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $1,135 million, $1,005 million and $977 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $218 million, $210 million and $227 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $223 million, $248 million and $209 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $862 million, $804 million and $823 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.78 years, 1.76 years and 1.71 years for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10 years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 4 years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Companys Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $20.86, $16.42 and $17.80, in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\n2021 2020 2019\nRisk-free rate 0.83 % 1.47 % 2.56 %\nExpected volatility 18.59 % 15.33 % 16.27 %\nExpected life (in years) 7.0 7.0 7.0\nExpected dividend yield 2.50 % 2.60 % 2.80 %\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Shares Weighted\nAverage Exercise Price Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 30, 2018 109,652 $ 98.29 $ 3,214\nOptions granted 19,745 131.94\nOptions exercised (14,785) 82.43\nOptions canceled/forfeited (2,975) 125.11\nShares at December 29, 2019 111,637 105.63 4,478\nOptions granted 20,723 151.41\nOptions exercised (16,275) 86.05\nOptions canceled/forfeited (1,835) 137.62\nShares at January 3, 2021 114,250 116.22 4,703\nOptions granted 18,525 164.62\nOptions exercised (13,248) 97.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited (2,166) 149.75\nShares at January 2, 2022 117,361 $ 125.36 $ 5,364\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $919 million, $1,021 million and $807 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 2, 2022:\n(Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Exercisable\nExercise Price Range Options Average Life(1)\nWeighted Average Exercise Price Options Weighted Average Exercise Price\n$65.08-$90.44\n16,007 1.6 $81.92 16,007 $81.92\n$100.06-$101.87\n22,647 3.6 $101.07 22,647 $101.07\n$115.67-$129.51\n24,543 5.6 $122.59 23,972 $122.43\n$131.94-$151.41\n36,304 7.6 $142.23 100 $140.72\n$151.42-$164.62\n17,860 9.1 $164.62 16 $164.62\n117,361 5.8 $125.36 62,742 $104.42\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 114,250 and an average life of 6.0 years and 111,637 and an average life of 6.0 years, respectively. Stock options exercisable at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 61,289 at an average price of $96.97 and 60,761 at an average price of $88.88, respectively.\nRestricted Share Units and Performance Share Units\nThe Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a three-year performance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from 6 months to 3 years and the achievement, over a three-year period, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based only on actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted.\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 2, 2022 is presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands) Outstanding Restricted Share Units Outstanding Performance Share Units\nShares at January 3, 2021 14,998 2,236\nGranted 4,981 741\nIssued (5,101) (610)\nCanceled/forfeited/adjusted (756) (55)\nShares at January 2, 2022 14,122 2,312\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $152.62, $139.58 and $121.31 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $611 million, $650 million and $586 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $179.35, $160.54 and $124.67 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant.\nThe fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $83 million, $91 million and $119 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n17.Segments of Business* and Geographic Areas\nSales to Customers % Change\n(Dollars in Millions) 2021 2020 2019 21 vs. 20 20 vs. 19\nConsumer Health\nOTC\nU.S. $ 2,594 2,460 2,010 5.4 % 22.4\nInternational 2,634 2,364 2,434 11.4 (2.9)\nWorldwide 5,227 4,824 4,444 8.4 8.5\nSkin Health/Beauty\nU.S. 2,400 2,350 2,392 2.1 (1.7)\nInternational 2,141 2,100 2,201 1.9 (4.6)\nWorldwide 4,541 4,450 4,593 2.0 (3.1)\nOral Care\nU.S. 637 683 621 (6.7) 9.9\nInternational 1,008 958 906 5.1 5.7\nWorldwide 1,645 1,641 1,528 0.2 7.4\nBaby Care\nU.S. 378 376 362 0.5 3.7\nInternational 1,188 1,141 1,313 4.1 (13.1)\nWorldwide 1,566 1,517 1,675 3.2 (9.4)\nWomen's Health\nU.S. 13 13 12 (1.6) 8.2\nInternational 905 888 974 1.8 (8.8)\nWorldwide 917 901 986 1.8 (8.6)\nWound Care/Other\nU.S. 495 480 441 3.1 8.9\nInternational 243 240 230 1.7 4.1\nWorldwide 739 720 671 2.6 7.2\nTOTAL CONSUMER HEALTH\nU.S. 6,516 6,362 5,839 2.4 9.0\nInternational 8,119 7,691 8,059 5.6 (4.6)\nWorldwide 14,635 14,053 13,898 4.1 1.1\nPHARMACEUTICAL\nImmunology\nU.S. 10,843 10,175 9,641 6.6 5.5\nInternational 5,907 4,880 4,309 21.0 13.2\nWorldwide 16,750 15,055 13,950 11.3 7.9\nREMICADE\u00ae\nU.S. 2,019 2,508 3,079 (19.5) (18.5)\nU.S. Exports 236 346 294 (31.9) 18.0\nInternational 935 893 1,007 4.8 (11.4)\nWorldwide 3,190 3,747 4,380 (14.9) (14.4)\nSIMPONI / SIMPONI ARIA\u00ae\nU.S. 1,127 1,155 1,159 (2.4) (0.3)\nInternational 1,148 1,088 1,029 5.5 5.8\nWorldwide 2,276 2,243 2,188 1.4 2.6\nSTELARA\u00ae\nU.S. 5,938 5,240 4,346 13.3 20.6\nInternational 3,196 2,467 2,015 29.6 22.4\nWorldwide 9,134 7,707 6,361 18.5 21.1\nTREMFYA\u00ae\nU.S. 1,503 926 764 62.3 21.3\nInternational 624 421 248 48.2 69.9\nWorldwide 2,127 1,347 1,012 57.9 33.2\nOTHER IMMUNOLOGY\nU.S. 21 -

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for $0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $6.0 billion, goodwill of $1.2 billion, other assets of $0.5 billion and liabilities of $1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.\nDuring fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $5.8 billion in cash and $1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a\nprivately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\nOn January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately \u00a5230 billion, which equates to approximately $2.1 billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06 Japanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO.\nThe Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment. During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $1.5 billion, goodwill for $1.2 billion and liabilities of $0.4 billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3 years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $3.4 billion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $2.35 billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $3.0 billion, goodwill for $2.0 billion, marketable securities of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $1.8 billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of approximately $1.1 billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Companys current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $0.1 billion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18% to 66% across Ottava sub-platforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5%.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $0.6 billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8 million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the company at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337 million ($357 million) based on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the Company had rights to approximately 38.7 million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF 445 million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110 million ($120 million) of this loan into approximately 9.6 million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $2.8 billion, consisting of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and $0.1 billion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $2.0 billion.\n19.Legal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves and in person trials resume.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Companys opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Companys balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR\u2122 XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR\u2122 Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE\u00ae Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL\u00ae; XARELTO\u00ae; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S\u00ae Baby Powder; INVOKANA\u00ae; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\u00ae Flexible Composite Mesh. As of January 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 250 plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR\u2122 XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR\u2122 Hip Resurfacing System; 5,300 with respect to the PINNACLE\u00ae Acetabular Cup System; 10,100 with respect to pelvic meshes; 8,800 with respect to RISPERDAL\u00ae; 5,500 with respect to XARELTO\u00ae; 40,400 with respect to body powders containing talc; 100 with respect to INVOKANA\u00ae; and 4,700 with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\u00ae Flexible Composite Mesh. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR\u2122 XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR\u2122 Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional\ncosts associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE\u00ae Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation also has been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\u00ae Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicons pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Companys accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicons pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court issued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the intermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full Court entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was filed in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in November 2021. Special leave was refused. While this brings an end to the appellate process, there will now be an individual case assessment process for the remaining group member claims. The parties currently are in discussions with the Court to determine the form and mechanism of that individual case assessment process. The next hearing is scheduled for late February 2022. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently negotiating the wording and some of the terms thereof and once finalized, the settlement will be subject to court approval. The parties are due to update the court on the status of the finalization of the settlement negotiations by the end of February 2022. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicons pelvic mesh products.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\u00ae Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma state court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. The deadline for issuance of Individual Allocation amounts by the Special Master is March 2022. The costs associated with this proposed settlement are reflected in the Companys accruals. Post-Settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of February 2022, there are approximately 90 active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\u00ae Mesh and PROCEED\u00ae Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States. Discovery is underway in the MCL proceedings.\nEthicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\u2122 Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\u00ae Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED\u00ae Mesh and PROCEED\u00ae Ventral Patch, and PROLENE\u2122 Polypropylene Hernia System products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL\u00ae, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $8.0 billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $6.8 million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Companys accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO\u00ae, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPIs collaboration partner for XARELTO\u00ae, Bayer Healthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson announced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO\u00ae cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO\u00ae related product liability litigation.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\u00ae Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase through fiscal year 2021.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Companys confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtors direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCIs assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Companys confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North\nCarolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court subsequently extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. While the PI effectively stays all of the Companys talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the automatic stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. Subsequent to the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party, as a result of the bankruptcy filing. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nIn February 2019, the Companys talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imeryss potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort Claimants Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponents Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn as improperly voted. In October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imeryss insurers (the Mediation Parties) have since agreed to engage in mediation.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys adversary proceeding). The Imerys adversary proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Companys talc liabilities from its other assets. The Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys adversary proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus adversary proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan. The Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against Talc Claims asserted against it. Cyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus adversary proceeding.\nIn February 2021, several of the Companys insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the Coverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a limited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\u00ae Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnsons shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiffs motion for class certification was completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiffs motion for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\u00ae Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Companys Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and demanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in the In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation.

Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Companys products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the Companys subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Companys subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.\nZYTIGA\u00ae\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc.

Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on\nAWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation.

(JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in approximately 3,400 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC\u00ae, NUCYNTA\u00ae and NUCYNTA\u00ae ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia.

The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are over 380 cases pending in various state courts. There are close to 3,000 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $465 million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial courts judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs' motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied.\nIn August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Companys anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers and distributors monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a statement of charges related to this investigation.\nIn June 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of New York and its participating subdivisions, including Nassau County and Suffolk County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Companys previously announced agreement in principle to contribute up to $5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The settlement provides New York and its participating subdivisions with up to $263 million to address opioid-related issues, reimburses attorney fees and costs, and removes the\nCompany and Janssen from a multi-defendant trial of opioid-related claims that commenced in Suffolk County in June 2021. In exchange, the Company and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating parties, including NYDFS.\nIn October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating subdivisions, including Dallas County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims against the Company on terms consistent with the Companys previously announced agreement to contribute up to $5 billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The settlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $297 million to address opioid-related issues and reimburse attorney fees and costs, and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether trials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in early 2022. In exchange, the Company and JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney Generals Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to one-third of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022, 45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected participation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled for trial in 2021, 2022, or 2023.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Companys Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsels report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder filed an amended complaint challenging the Boards rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2021, the Court held oral argument on Johnson & Johnsons motion. In February 2022, the Court granted Johnson & Johnsons motion to dismiss the amended complaint. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed case is pending.\nIn December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey.

Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the consolidated action.

(now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorneys Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR\u2122 XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the District Court granted the companies motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied the qui tam relators request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District Courts dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators request to file a third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators second amended complaint; the District Court denied DePuys motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for reconsideration of the District Courts July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuys motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Courts order was unsealed in December 2021. The Relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for reconsideration.

(now known as Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers use of talc contained in JOHNSONS\u00ae Baby Powder and JOHNSONS\u00ae Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Johnson & Johnson and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the States claim was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson & Johnson and JJCIs request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. Thereafter, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting due to the LTL Bankruptcy and that any decision on whether the stay applied should be deferred to the LTL Bankruptcy court. The State opposed any stay and argued that the trial court should decide issues concerning the stay. The motion for trial setting and JJCIs objections were heard in November 2021 and in January 2022, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. That process is underway. In August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Courts ruling of April 2021, the State responded to the Petition for Writ of Certiorari in November 2021, the JJCI filed a reply in November 2021, and the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari in December 2021.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos.

Restructuring\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion, over the 4 to 5 year period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2021:\n(Dollars in Millions) Severance Asset Write-offs/Sales Other(2)\nTotal\nReserve balance, December 29, 2019\n$ 164 - 16 180\n2020 activity (29) - (7) (36)\nReserve balance, January 3, 2021\n135 - 9 144\nCurrent year activity:\nCharges - 53 420 473\nCash settlements (23) (404) (427)\nSettled non cash - (53) (53)\nReserve balance, January 2, 2022(1)\n$ 112 - 25 137\n(1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next year in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.\n(2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.\nThe Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January 2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Companys rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to managements estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies - Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management continues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding managements confidence in the safety of the Companys talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL), which became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became responsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Companys process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Companys in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of managements assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Companys litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation - Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments, including tribal governments, related to opioids matters. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized, depending upon the level of participation by the various parties. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the agreement to settle the opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Companys process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Companys in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of managements assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Companys litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The Companys assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Companys processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 2, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\n/s/ J.

Item 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, and the attestation regarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees have worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Companys financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.
