    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including believes, expects, may, will, should, seeks, intends, plans, pro forma, estimates, anticipates, or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: demand for AMDs products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; future restructuring activities; the nature and extent of AMDs future payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) and the materiality of these payments; the materiality of AMDs future purchases from GF; sales patterns of AMDs semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products; AMDs expected completion of its restructuring plan announced in October 2015 (the 2015 Restructuring Plan) and the anticipated cash payments and savings from the 2015 Restructuring Plan; statements regarding the proposed joint ventures (the JVs) between AMD and Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics, Co., Ltd., including the JVs expected future performance (including expected results of operations and financial guidance); benefits from the proposed JVs; the JVs future financial condition, operating results, strategy and plans; statements about regulatory and other approvals; the closing date for the proposed transaction; AMD's expected future filing of patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions; AMD's expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; the expected completion of AMD's exit from its dense server business; the level of international sales as compared to total sales; that AMD does not expect to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months; that other unrecognized tax benefits will not materially change in the next 12 months; that AMDs cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, the savings from its restructuring plans and the secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) will be sufficient to fund AMDs operations including capital expenditures over the next 12 months; AMDs ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; its dependence on a small number of customers for a substantial part of its revenue; its hedging strategy; its expenditures related to environmental compliance and conflict minerals disclosure requirements; and AMD does not expect to pay dividends in the future. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMDs ability to compete effectively; AMD relies on GF to manufacture all of its microprocessor and APU products and a certain portion of its GPU products, with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy AMDs manufacturing requirements, its business could be adversely impacted; AMD relies on third parties to manufacture its products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, AMDs business could be materially adversely affected; failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMDs products could negatively impact its financial results; the success of AMDs business is dependent upon its ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to its customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions; if AMD cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, it may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of its planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments; the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on AMD; global economic uncertainty may adversely impact AMDs business and operating results; AMD may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations or meet its working capital requirements; AMD has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect its financial position and prevent it from implementing its strategy or fulfilling its contractual obligations; the agreements governing AMDs notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on AMD that may adversely affect its ability to operate its business; the completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, its transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect it; the markets in which AMDs products are sold are highly competitive; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMDs products could materially adversely affect it; AMDs receipt of revenue from its semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products; the demand for AMDs products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for AMDs products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations; AMDs ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property; AMD depends on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards and other computer platform components to support its business; if AMD loses Microsoft Corporations support for its products or other software vend\nors do not design and develop software to run on AMDs products, its ability to sell its products could be materially adversely affected; AMDs reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects it to certain risks; AMDs inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder its product development programs; in the event of a change of control, AMD may not be able to repurchase its outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and its Secured Revolving Line of Credit; the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect its business in the future; acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt its business, harm its financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of its common stock; AMDs business is dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt its business, processes and internal controls; data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise AMDs intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to its business and reputation; AMDs operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; if essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture its products, AMD could be materially adversely affected; if AMDs products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, it could be materially adversely affected; costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on AMD; if AMD fails to maintain the efficiency of its supply chain as it responds to changes in customer demand for its products, its business could be materially adversely affected; AMD outsources to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of its product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services; AMD may incur future impairments of goodwill; AMDs worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for AMDs products; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect AMD; AMDs inability to effectively control the sales of its products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on it; if AMD cannot adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, it may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses; AMD may not be able to successfully monetize its intellectual property; AMD is a party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products; AMDs business is subject to potential tax liabilities; a variety of environmental laws that AMD is subject to could result in additional costs and liabilities; and higher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect AMDs business.\nFor a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, see Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously.\nIntel Corporations dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively.\nIntel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intels market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability.\nIntel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intels position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, are distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards.\nAs long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intels:\nbusiness practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins;\nproduct mix and introduction schedules;\nproduct bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies;\nexclusivity payments to its current and potential customers and channel partners;\nde facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system, or BIOS, suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and\nmarketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer OEM customers.\nIntel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intels aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. For example, Intel has introduced microprocessors for low-cost notebooks, similar to products that we offer for low-cost notebooks.\nIntel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information.\nIntels position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe rely on GF to manufacture all of our microprocessor and APU products and a certain portion of our GPU products, with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements, from GF with limited exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience delays in product launches, supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if our requirements are less than the number of wafers that we committed to purchase, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations.\nWe are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. If we do not successfully conclude our negotiations, it could have a material adverse impact on our gross margin and our results of operations.\nIn addition, GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis, or at all, GFs ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack certain of our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand.\nWe cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and assemble, test and package products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business.\nIf we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.\nSemiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries, including GF, are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. As consumers adopt new form factors, have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes a new x86 processor core codenamed Zen to help drive our re-entry into high-performance and server computing. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap and address markets beyond our core PC market will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis.\nDelays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customers system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business.\nIn addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments.\nOur ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline.\nWe regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moodys or Standard & Poors may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. In July 2015, Moodys lowered our corporate credit rating to Caa1 from B3 and our senior unsecured debt rating to Caa2 from Caa1. Furthermore, in October 2015, Standard & Poors lowered our corporate credit rating to CCC+ from B- and our senior unsecured debt rating to CCC from B-.\nCredit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.\nCollectively, our top five customers accounted for approximately 68% of our net revenue during the year ended 2015. On a segment basis, in 2015, five customers accounted for approximately 53% of the net revenue of our Computing and Graphics segment and five customers accounted for approximately 95% of the net revenue of our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. We expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of revenue of our businesses in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces or reorganizes its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nGlobal economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nUncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Line of Credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.\nOur total debt as of December 26, 2015 was $2.26 billion. Our substantial indebtedness may:\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments;\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes;\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, the risk that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates and the risk that our exposure to interest rates may increase if interest rates increase.\nThe agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe indentures governing our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes), 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) and 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:\nincur additional indebtedness;\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\nmake certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries;\ncreate or permit certain liens;\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us;\nuse the proceeds from sales of assets;\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and\nconsolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.\nOur Secured Revolving Line of Credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. In addition, further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the First Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) available cash is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. If Payment Conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things:\ncreate any liens upon any of the Loan Parties property (other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit));\ndeclare or make cash distributions;\ncreate any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments;\nmake asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements;\nmake certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date; and\nbecome party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties ability to enter into any non-arms-length transaction with an affiliate.\nThe agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 6.75% Notes, as well as under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 6.75% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\nThe completion and impact of the 2015 Restructuring Plan, our transformation initiatives and any future restructuring actions could adversely affect us.\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016. These restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions could have an adverse impact on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. We cannot be sure that we will realize operational savings or any other anticipated benefits from the 2015 Restructuring Plan or any future restructuring actions. Any operating savings are subject to assumptions, estimates and significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nAny transformation initiatives or future restructuring actions we undertake may fail to achieve the anticipated results and may materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.\nThe markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality (including enabling state-of-the-art visual experience), power consumption (including battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility and stability, brand recognition and availability.\nWe expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to companion technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. With the introduction of our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to significantly invest greater resources in research and development than anticipated.\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel.\nPC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins.\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include:\na sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products;\na production or design defect in our products;\na higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements;\na failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or\nour competitors taking aggressive pricing actions.\nFor example, in the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an inventory write-down of $65 million consisting primarily of older generation APUs, which adversely impacted our operating results. Since market conditions are uncertain, these and other factors could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products.\nThe revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers desire to pursue the project, and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-partys products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndustry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation\u00ae4 and Microsoft Xbox One game console systems worldwide.\nOur ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\nIn the design and development of new products and product enhancements, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as software development tools and hardware testing tools. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support our business.\nWe depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software (e.g. BIOS, operating systems) and other components that our customers utilize to support our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on AIBs to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, software and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose Microsoft Corporations support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers sold with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected.\nOur reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks.\nWe market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIBs to offer our competitors products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIBs to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB or a substantial number of our distributors or AIBs terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditionally, distributors and AIBs typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors and AIBs, resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs, until the applicable products are re-sold by the distributors or the AIBs. However, in the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline.\nOur inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs.\nMuch of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. In addition, our current and any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nIn the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit.\nUpon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 6.75% Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 26, 2015, $230 million was outstanding under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and $2.03 billion was outstanding under our notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to:\nsubstantial declines in average selling prices;\nthe cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry;\na decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and\nexcess inventory levels.\nIndustry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. For example, form factor devices continue to shift from desktop PCs and notebooks to smaller form factor devices. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have experienced and continue to experience a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles.\nGlobal economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns.\nThe growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nAcquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through divestitures or joint ventures rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. We may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services.\nIn October, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Partys affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. The Transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016 and is expected to simplify our business model while strengthening our balance sheet. The Transaction requires numerous international regulatory approvals in order to close. It is possible that we may not receive the approvals necessary to close the Transaction in a timely manner or the approvals may result in additional unanticipated costs.\nThe long duration between entering into a definitive agreement and the proposed closing in the first half of 2016 could result in loss of employee morale and result in loss of key employees affecting the success of the JVs. While we expect the Transaction to be cost neutral with reduced capital expenditures, the Transaction could potentially increase our cost for ATMP services with little to no measurable reduction in our capital expenditures. Additionally, we may not realize the expected benefits from the Transaction including the JVs expected future performance and financial projections and the JVs expected future results of operations and financial condition. The majority of ATMP services will be provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to adequately fulfill our ATMP requirements as we transition operations to the JV Party, nor is there any guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time.\nThese changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.\nIn addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. In addition, we could be subject to potential claims for damages resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerabilities in the security of our processors. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. The integrity and protection of our worker data is critical to our business and our workers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. We anticipate an increase in costs related to:\nimplementing new data security procedures, including costs related to upgrading computer and network security;\ntraining workers to maintain and monitor our security measures;\nremediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; and\nmitigating reputational harm.\nWe often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.\nA substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales. In addition, with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles, we expect sales patterns to follow the seasonal trends of a consumer business with sales in the first half of the year being lower than sales in the second half of the year. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nIf essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.\nWe purchase equipment and materials for our internal back-end manufacturing operations from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another.\nFrom time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected.\nOur products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCosts related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.\nProducts as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, delay in recognition or loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.\nWe rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately.\nWe may incur future impairments of goodwill.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in managements business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges.\nOur worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by us as well as third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 75% in 2015. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future.\nThe political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation:\nexpropriation;\nchanges in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions;\nchanges in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property;\ndifficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws;\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\nrestrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions;\nchanges in freight and interest rates;\ndisruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities;\nloss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIn addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Sunnyvale operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as Avian Influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWorldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products.\nWorldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.\nWe have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.\nOur inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market. Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new.\nIf we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.\nWe rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us.\nFurthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may\nindependently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products.\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, on January 15, 2014, March 20, 2014, April 27, 2015 and September 29, 2015, complaints were filed against us seeking damages for alleged securities law violations which are described in Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us, including the claims filed against us on January 15, 2014, March 20, 2014, April 27, 2015 and September 29, 2015, may result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business.\nWith respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded.\nEven if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is subject to potential tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nA variety of environmental laws that we are subject to could result in additional costs and liabilities.\nOur operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future\nenvironmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us.\nCertain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict free. If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitors products.\nHigher health care costs and labor costs could adversely affect our business.\nWith the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA), we are required to provide affordable coverage, as defined in the ACA, to all employees, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria in the ACA. Additionally, some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provision of certain levels of health benefits by some employers. Increased health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets. ITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES\nAt December 26, 2015, we owned research and development, engineering and manufacturing facilities located in China and manufacturing and administrative facilities located in Malaysia. These facilities totaled approximately 766,000 square feet and include approximately 265,000 square feet of assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities. Our current microprocessor assembly and test facilities located in Malaysia and China are described in further detail in the section entitled Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities, above.\nIn some cases, we lease the land on which our facilities are located. We lease approximately 425,000 square feet of land in Suzhou, China for our microprocessor assembly and test facilities.\nAs of December 26, 2015, we also leased approximately 2.23 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. The lease for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California expires in December 2018, and provides for two successive 10-year optional renewals. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The lease for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expires in February 2028, and provides for one 5-year optional renewal.\nWe currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy, or replacing them with equivalent facilities.\nWe also have approximately 117,000 square feet of building space that is currently vacant. We continue to have lease obligations with respect to portions of this space that expire at various dates through 2018. We are actively marketing portions of our vacant lease space for sublease.\nWe believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that, except as discussed above, the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. ITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSecurities Class Action\nOn January 15, 2014, a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al., C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 (the Hatamian Lawsuit) was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against AMD and certain individual officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period from April 4, 2011 through October 18, 2012. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual officers regarding our 32nm technology and Llano product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys fees and costs. On July 7, 2014, we filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims. On March 31, 2015, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. On May 14, 2015, we filed our answer to plaintiffs corrected amended complaint. The discovery process is ongoing. On September 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. A court-ordered mediation held in January 2016 did not result in a settlement of the lawsuit.\nBased upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al., Case No. 1:14-cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual directors and officers regarding our 32nm technology and Llano product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al., Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-01890. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the shareholder vote on AMDs 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently stayed.\nBased upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nOther Matters\nWe are a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. ITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol AMD.

Under the terms of our indentures for our 6.75% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 7.75% Notes and 7.50% Notes, we are prohibited from paying cash dividends if the aggregate amount of dividends and other restricted payments made by us since entering into each indenture would exceed the sum of specified financial measures including fifty percent of consolidated net income as that term is defined in the indentures. We are prohibited from paying cash dividends on our common stock when certain payment conditions (Payment Conditions) are not satisfied. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties excess available cash is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million.\nFor information about our equity compensation plans, see Part III, Item 11, below.\nPerformance Graph\nComparison of Five-Year Cumulative Total Returns\nAdvanced Micro Devices, S&P 500 and 400 Indicies and S&P 500 and 400 Semiconductor Indicies\nThe following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return on our common stock, the S&P 500 and 400 Indicies and the S&P 500 and 400 Semiconductor Indicies from December 23, 2010 through December 26, 2015.

Pursuant to these licenses and settlements, we received in aggregate, $48 million, net, which we recorded within net legal settlements in 2013.\n(3)\nDuring 2011, we changed the method of accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting. As a result of the change, we recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $492 million, net of certain transaction related charges. In 2011, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $209 million related to our investment in GF.\n(4)\nDuring the first quarter of 2012, we entered into a second amendment to the WSA with GF. The primary effect of this amendment was to modify certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us during 2012. As a result of the amendment, we recorded a $703 million charge during the first quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our production wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million, which resulted in a $273 million lower of cost or market charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012.\n(5)\nIn 2015, 2014, 2012 and 2011, we implemented restructuring plans and incurred net charges of $53 million, $58 million, $6 million, $100 million and $100 million in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which primarily consisted of severance and related employee benefits.\n(6)\nIn 2015, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro resulting to a charge of $76 million in restructuring and other special charges, net. In 2014, we incurred other special charges of $13 million primarily related to the departure of our former CEO. In 2013, we sold and leased back buildings in various locations and land in Austin, Texas, for which we recorded a net charge of $24 million in other special charges.\n(7)\nIn 2014, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million related to our Computing and Graphics segment. Also in 2014, we recorded a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment related to our second generation APU products.\n(8)\nIn 2008, we sold our Digital Television business to Broadcom Corporation for $141.5 million and classified it as discontinued operations. In 2011, we recorded a charge of $4 million in connection with a payment to Broadcom related to this asset sale.\n(9)\nTotal long-term debt and other long term liabilities increased by $110 million from 2012 to 2013, primarily due to obligations associated with the license of $157 million of new technology and software, partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes). Total long-term debt and other long term liabilities increased by $475 million from 2011 to 2012, primarily due to an issuance of $500 million principal amount of our 7.50% Notes. See Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1: Business, Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data and Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntroduction\nWe are a global semiconductor company primarily offering:\n(i)\nx86 microprocessors, as a standalone central processing unit (CPU) or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer, commercial and professional graphics markets; and\n(ii)\nserver and embedded CPUs, GPUs and APUs, and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.\nIn this MD&A, we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements.\nOverview\nWe faced a challenging business environment in 2015. The impact of global macro-economic conditions, especially the volatility in the Greater China region contributed to a decrease in demand for our products. Additionally, competitive pressures contributed to an overall challenging year. We also experienced reduced demand from our Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) customers in advance of the launch of Microsoft Windows\u00ae 10. Net revenue for 2015 was approximately $4.0 billion, a decrease of 28% compared to 2014 net revenue of $5.5 billion. The decrease in net revenue from 2014 was due to a 42% decrease in Computing and Graphics segment revenue and an 8% decrease in Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue. Computing and Graphics segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower client processor sales. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue declined year-over-year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalties, partially offset by higher semi-custom SoC sales. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2015, was 27% compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and due to lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Operating loss for 2015 was $481 million compared to an operating loss of $155 million in 2014. The decline in operating performance in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue and in gross margin as described above.\nDespite the challenging business environment, we made important changes to our business. During 2015, we continued to focus on introducing a more diverse product portfolio. As part of our long-term strategy to deliver great products, we introduced a number of new products in 2015 including, our 6th Generation AMD A-Series mobile processors (formerly codenamed Carrizo) in a SoC design and introduced a desktop A-series processor, the AMD A10-7870K APU. We also introduced the A8-7670K APU designed to support Windows\u00ae 10, mainstream workloads and online gaming. With respect to our graphics products, we introduced the new AMD Radeon\u2122 R9 Fury X and R9 Fury graphics, the AMD Radeon R7 300 and R9 300 series graphics as well as the AMD Radeon M300 series graphics to reinforce our graphics leadership in both power efficiency for notebooks and best-in class performance for desktops. We also expanded our AMD FirePro\u2122 server GPU family by introducing the AMD FirePro S9170, designed for high performance compute (HPC) environments. The AMD FirePro S9170 is based on second-generation AMD Graphics Core Next (GCN) GPU architecture and a unified scalable GPU optimized for graphics and compute. We announced the AMD FirePro W4300 graphics card designed for Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for both small and full-size workstations. We also launched the AMD Radeon R9 Nano, a small-form-factor mini-ITX enthusiast graphics card designed to deliver energy efficiency and performance for ultra-high resolutions, improved virtual reality experiences and smoother gameplay. With respect\nto our embedded products, we introduced the AMD Embedded R-Series SOC processor designed for digital signage, retail signage, medical imaging, electronic gaming, media storage and communications and networking.\nDuring 2015, we continued to focus on reducing our expenses. Our operating expenses in 2015 decreased to $1.56 billion, from $1.99 billion in 2014. Our operating expenses in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million. We also took steps to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. In the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan). The 2015 Restructuring Plan provides for a workforce reduction of approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. The 2015 Restructuring Plan also anticipates a charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facilities. We realized operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $8 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan to result in operational savings, primarily in operating expenses, of approximately $48 million in 2016.\nOn October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Partys affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 26, 2015 were $785 million compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. Total debt as of December 26, 2015 was $2.26 billion, compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014.\nGLOBALFOUNDRIES\nFormation and Accounting\nOn March 2, 2009, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (currently known as Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which we formed GF. In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, AMD, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) on March 2, 2009.\nAt GFs formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and we were deemed to be GFs primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, we deconsolidated GF and accounted for our GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became our related party.\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, our ownership in GF was diluted, and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, we changed our accounting for our investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. We performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of our remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011.\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, we transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that we owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and we were no longer party to the Shareholders Agreement. As a result of these transactions, we no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of us because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, our largest stockholder. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala.\nWafer Supply Agreement\nThe WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.\nThe WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.\nThird Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On December 6, 2012, we entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, we modified our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, we agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor and APU products, to be delivered by GF to us from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of our wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, we agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, we recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013.\nFourth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On March 30, 2014, we entered into a fourth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fourth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2014 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom game console products to be delivered by GF to us during the 2014 calendar year.\nFifth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On April 16, 2015, we entered into a fifth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fifth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2015 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of our microprocessor unit, graphics processor unit and semi-custom products to be delivered by GF to us during the 2015 calendar year.\nAs of December 26, 2015, certain wafer deliveries under the fifth amendment to the WSA have been delayed until fiscal 2016. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which approximately $185 million, consisting of wafers and research and development activities, were received by December 31, 2015.\nWe generally negotiate our purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.\nOur total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $0.9 billion for 2015 and approximately $1 billion for each 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nEquity Interest Purchase Agreement\nOn October 15, 2015, we entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which we will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and we estimate we will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Partys affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of our subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to us. We plan to account for our investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting.\nThe Equity Interest Purchase Agreement also has related agreements including: (i) with respect to the Malaysian Target Company, a Shareholders Agreement, and with respect to the Chinese Target Company, a Joint Venture Contract governing the joint venture relationships from and after the Closing, (ii) an IP License Agreement, (iii) a Manufacturing Services Agreement, (iv) a Transition Services Agreement, and (v) a Trademark License Agreement.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, pending all regulatory and other approvals.\nAs a result of the decision to form the above JVs, the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015, reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which requires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. We reclassified $183 million to other current assets and $79 million to other current liabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets primarily consist of property, plant, and equipment of $110 million, goodwill of $42 million and inventory of $15 million. Liability balances reclassified into other current liabilities primarily consist of accounts payable of $70 million. The balances included in the final gain/(loss) calculation, at closing, are likely to be different due to normal operational activities occurring through the closing date.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with managements expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nManagement believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to managements judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results.\nInventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and market value. If, in any period, we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales, resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment present.\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. We evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value and, if so, by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The implied fair value of a reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation models common to our industry, including the income, market and cost approaches. While market valuation data for comparable companies is gathered and analyzed, we believe that there has not been sufficient comparability between the peer groups and the specific reporting units to allow for the derivation of reliable indications of value using a market approach. Therefore, we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimates of present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market condition. The key assumptions we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting units includes projected cash flows for the next 10 years and discount rates ranging from 13% to 35% from 2013 to 2015. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the\nuncertainty related to the reporting units ability to execute on the projected cash flows. A variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded, if any.\nEstimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2015, each reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value, ranging from approximately 17% to approximately 196%. The Computing and Graphics reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at 17%, however there is no goodwill within this reporting unit. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 27, 2015, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2014, we determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of $233 million was recorded, which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit. The remaining two reporting units estimated fair values exceeded their carrying value, ranging from approximately 156% to approximately 209%. In estimating the fair value of our reporting units, we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trends that existed as of September 28, 2014, the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit.\nBased on the results of our annual analysis of goodwill in 2013, each reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nEstimates of fair value for all or our reporting units can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors. Potential events or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumptions we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units include adverse changes in our industry, increased competition, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecasts, and a decline in our stock price. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units declines due to any of these factors, we may be required to record future goodwill impairment.\nIncome Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes.\nWe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense, in the form of a valuation allowance, for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on managements judgment. In connection with our continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, we realigned our organizational structure. As a result of this organizational change, we have the following two reportable segments:\nthe Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs and professional graphics; and\nthe Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, engineering services and royalties.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, we have an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does\nnot consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other special charges, net, technology node transition charge, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge, significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. We also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, the primary factors that resulted in those changes and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\nWe use a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 each included 52 weeks. References in this report to 2015, 2014 and 2013 refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013. The results prior to July 1, 2014 have been recast to reflect our new reportable segments.\n(In millions)\nNet revenue:\nComputing and Graphics\n$\n1,805\n$\n3,132\n$\n3,720\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom\n2,186\n2,374\n1,577\nAll Other\n-\n-\nTotal net revenue\n$\n3,991\n$\n5,506\n$\n5,299\nOperating income (loss):\nComputing and Graphics\n$\n(502\n)\n$\n(76\n)\n$\n(101\n)\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom\nAll Other\n(194\n)\n(478\n)\n(91\n)\nTotal operating income (loss)\n$\n(481\n)\n$\n(155\n)\n$\nInterest expense\n(160\n)\n(177\n)\n(177\n)\nOther income expense, net\n(5\n)\n(66\n)\n-\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(646\n)\n$\n(398\n)\n$\n(74\n)\nComputing and Graphics\nComputing and Graphics net revenue of $1.8 billion in 2015 decreased by 42% compared to $3.1 billion in 2014 as a result of a 44% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 3% increase in average selling price. Unit shipments of all our Computing and Graphics products decreased. The decrease in unit shipments of all categories of products was due to lower demand caused by challenging global macro economic conditions, especially in the Greater China region, in addition to increased competitive pressures and reduced demand from our OEM customers in advance of the Microsoft Windows\u00ae 10 operating system. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our notebook GPU products and AIB products due to a favorable shift in our product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of our notebook microprocessor products and chipset products.\nComputing and Graphics net revenue of $3.1 billion in 2014 decreased by 16% compared to $3.7 billion in 2013 as a result of a 27% decrease in unit shipments, partially offset by a 15% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was primarily attributable to lower unit shipments of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs and chipsets due to challenging consumer PC market conditions and our chipsets being integrated into our APU products. The increase in average selling price was primarily attributable to an increase in average selling price of our microprocessor products due to improved product mix of our microprocessor products for desktop and notebook PCs.\nComputing and Graphics operating loss was $502 million in 2015 compared to $76 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $696 million decrease in cost of sales, a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses and an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2015 compared to 2014, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $52 million as a result of lower anticipated demand for primarily older-generation APU products.\nOperating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.\nComputing and Graphics operating loss was $76 million in 2014 compared to an operating loss of $101 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to a $323 million decrease in cost of sales, a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses and an $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the decrease in net revenue referenced above. Cost of sales decreased primarily due to lower unit shipments in 2014 compared to 2013. Operating loss in 2014 included a $19 million benefit from technology licensing revenue. In addition, operating loss in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that had been previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, as compared to a similar $8 million benefit in 2014. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased for the reasons set forth under Expenses, below.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.2 billion in 2015 decreased by 8% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue received in connection with lower unit shipments of our server and embedded products due primarily to increased competitive pressures, as well as due to the decrease in net revenue from certain royalty arrangements and a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue. The decrease in net revenue was partially offset by an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2014 increased by 51% compared to net revenue of $1.6 billion in 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net revenue received in connection with higher unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products, which we began shipping in the second quarter of 2013.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $215 million in 2015 compared to $399 million in 2014. The decline in operating results was primarily due to the decrease in net revenue referenced above and a $16 million increase in research and development expenses, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses and a $2 million decrease in cost of sales. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a decrease in unit shipments of our server and embedded products in 2015 compared to 2014, largely offset by a technology node transition charge of $33 million and an inventory write-down of $13 million. Marketing, general and administrative expenses decreased and research and development expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $399 million in 2014 compared to $295 million in 2013. The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by a $614 million increase in cost of sales, a $64 million increase in research and development expenses and a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of our semi-custom SoC products in 2014 compared to 2013. In addition, operating income in 2014 included an $8 million benefit from technology license revenue. Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative expenses increased for the reasons set forth under Expenses below.\nAll Other\nAll Other revenue pertains to results from former businesses, which were immaterial in 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nAll Other operating loss of $194 million in 2015 primarily included restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million and stock-based compensation expense of $63 million. Restructuring and other special charges, net of $129 million included $76 million related to our decision to exit from the dense server systems business, $37 million related to our 2015 Restructuring Plan and $16 million related to our 2014 Restructuring Plan.\nAll Other operating loss of $478 million in 2014 included a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million, stock-based compensation expense of $81 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $71 million, lower of cost or market inventory adjustment of $58 million, $14 million related to workforce rebalancing severance charges, $14 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets and $7 million related to other expenses.\nAll Other operating loss of $91 million in 2013 included stock-based compensation expense of $91 million, net restructuring and other special charges of $30 million and $18 million related to amortization of acquired intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlements regarding patent-related matters, for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses.\nComparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Income, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net and Income Taxes\nThe following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n(In millions, except for percentages)\nCost of sales\n$\n2,911\n$\n3,667\n$\n3,321\nGross margin\n1,080\n1,839\n1,978\nGross margin percentage\n%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\n1,072\n1,201\nMarketing, general and administrative\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\nRestructuring and other special charges, net\nGoodwill impairment charge\n-\n-\nLegal settlements, net\n-\n-\n(48\n)\nInterest expense\n(160\n)\n(177\n)\n(177\n)\nOther expense, net\n(5\n)\n(66\n)\n-\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nGross Margin\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 27% in 2015 compared to 33% in 2014. Gross margin in 2015 was adversely impacted by an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. The impact of the write-down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage points and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2015 was also adversely impacted by a lower proportion of revenue from Computing and Graphics segment due to lower sales which has a higher average gross margin than our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and also by lower game console royalties. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point.\nGross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 33% in 2014 compared to 37% in 2013. Gross margin in 2014 included a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point, and a $27 million benefit from technology licensing revenue, which accounted for less than one gross margin percentage point. Gross margin in 2013 included a $57 million benefit from sales of inventory that was previously reserved in the third quarter of 2012, which accounted for one gross margin percentage point as compared to $8 million in 2014 which had a less than one percentage point impact. Gross margin in 2014 was adversely impacted by lower average gross margins in our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment driven by increased sales of lower margin semi-custom SoC products.\nExpenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses of $947 million in 2015 decreased by $125 million, or 12%, compared to $1.1 billion in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a $120 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment and a $21 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $9 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and an $8 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. The decrease was partially offset by a $16 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $116 million decrease in product engineering and design costs and a $4 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to a $17 million increase in product engineering and design costs.\nResearch and development expenses of $1.1 billion in 2014 decreased by $129 million, or 11%, compared to $1.2 billion in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a $201 million decrease in research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $64 million increase in research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $9 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Research and development expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $171 million decrease in product engineering and design costs, a $22 million decrease in other employee compensation and benefit expenses and a $10 million decrease in manufacturing process technology expenses. Research and development expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment,\nwhere we expect to continue to increase our investment, increased primarily due to a $59 million increase in product engineering and design costs and a $3 million increase in other employee compensation and benefit expenses.\nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $482 million in 2015 decreased by $122 million, or 20%, compared to $604 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to an $84 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, a $19 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $19 million decrease in the All Other category primarily related to a $5 million workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in 2014 and a $10 million decrease in stock-based compensation expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $62 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $22 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment decreased primarily due to a $5 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses.\nMarketing, general and administrative expenses of $604 million in 2014 decreased by $70 million, or 10%, compared to $674 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to an $89 million decrease in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment, partially offset by a $15 million increase in marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and a $5 million increase in the All Other category related to a workforce rebalancing severance charge recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Computing and Graphics segment decreased primarily due to a $61 million decrease in sales and marketing expenses and a $25 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. Marketing, general and administrative expenses attributable to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased primarily due to an $8 million increase in sales and marketing expenses and a $5 million increase in other general and administrative expenses.\nLegal Settlements\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We have agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision and $2 million in interest.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters for which we received in aggregate $48 million in net cash, which we recorded as an offset to operating expenses. At the time we entered into the agreements, we did not have any future obligations that we were required to perform in order to earn the settlement payments. Accordingly, we recognized the entire settlement amount in our operating results for the fourth quarter of 2013.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $3 million in 2015, $14 million in 2014 and $18 million in 2013. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was due to the impairment of intangible assets as a result of our exit from the dense server systems business in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was due to the reduced amortization base amount of acquired intangible assets of ATI.\nRestructuring and Other Special Charges, Net\nEffects of Restructuring Plans\n2015 Restructuring Plan\nIn the third quarter of 2015, we implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on our ongoing efforts to simplify our business and better align resources around our priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, we recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in total cash payments of $14 million in 2015. We expect the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016. We expect actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\nSeverance\nand related\nbenefits\nOther exit\nrelated\ncosts\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBalance as of June 27, 2015\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nCharges (reversals), net\nCash payments\n(13\n)\n(1\n)\n(14\n)\nNon-cash charges\n-\n(9\n)\n(9\n)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n$\n-\n$\n2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of our real estate footprint with our reduced headcount. We recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, we recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities related costs. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\nSeverance\nand related\nbenefits\nOther exit\nrelated\ncosts\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBalance as of December 27, 2014\n$\n$\n$\nCharges (reversals), net\nCash payments\n(23\n)\n(7\n)\n(30\n)\nNon-cash charges\n-\n(5\n)\n(5\n)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n$\n$\n2012 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, we implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve our cost structure and to strengthen our competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. We recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million, which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, we incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee-related severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012 restructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of our strategy to simplify and sharpen our investment focus, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, we recorded a charge of $76 million in Restructuring and other special charges, net on our consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. We concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with our dense server systems business was fully impaired as we did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of our future products nor did we have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits\nand $3 million for contract or program termination costs. We expect to complete this exit activity by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nExecutive Officer Separation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded other special charges of $13 million. The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of our former CEO, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. The amount is recorded under Restructuring and other special charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSale and Leaseback Transactions\nIn September 2013, we sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. We received net cash proceeds of $46 million in connection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a deferred gain of $14 million as of September 28, 2013 that is being amortized over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term, and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter.\nIn September 2013, we also sold an office building in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $10 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $5 million gain in the third quarter of 2013.\nIn March 2013, we sold and leased back certain land and office buildings in Austin, Texas. We received net cash proceeds of $164 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $52 million charge in the first quarter of 2013. The operating lease expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10-year optional renewal.\nIn March 2013, we also sold an office building in Markham, Ontario, Canada and leased back a portion of the original space through June 2013. We received net cash proceeds of $13 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $6 million gain in the first quarter of 2013.\nThe net charge of $24 million recognized in 2013 related to the real estate transactions described above is recorded in the Restructuring and other special charges, net line item on the consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $160 million in 2015 decreased by $17 million compared to $177 million in 2014, primarily due to timing of issuances of new debt and repurchases of other debt in 2014.\nInterest expense of $177 million in 2014 was flat compared to $177 million in 2013.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net, in 2015 was $5 million compared to $66 million of other expense, net, in 2014 and $0 million of other expense, net, in 2013.\nIn 2015, we recognized $5 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIn 2014, we recognized $66 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $61 million loss from debt repurchases and a $7 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by $3 million interest income.\nIn 2013, we recognized $0 million of other expense, net, primarily due to a $2 million loss from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and a $2 million realized loss on sale of our auction rate securities (ARS) investments, offset by $5 million interest income.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $14 million, $5 million and $9 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe income tax provision in 2015 was primarily due to $16 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.\nThe income tax provision in 2014 was primarily due to $7 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.\nThe income tax provision in 2013 was primarily due to $9 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations and $3 million\nrelated to the reversal of previously recognized tax benefits associated with other comprehensive income, offset by $3 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits.\nAs of December 26, 2015, substantially all of our U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 26, 2015, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of our subsidiaries activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. We have agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties, which was reflected in full in the 2015 tax provision, and $2 million in interest.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nWe allocated stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 in our consolidated statements of operations as follows:\n(In millions)\nCost of sales\n$\n$\n$\nResearch and development\nMarketing, general and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0\n$\n$\n$\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows.\nStock-based compensation expense of $63 million in 2015 decreased by $18 million as compared to $81 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average grant date fair value and the effect of the 2015 and 2014 Restructuring Plans.\nStock-based compensation expense of $81 million in 2014 decreased by $10 million as compared to $91 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower expense related to stock options and restricted stock granted in connection with our SeaMicro acquisition as most awards became fully vested during 2014 and lower stock compensation expense as a result of our 2014 Restructuring Plan.\nAs of December 26, 2015, we had $11 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.30 years. Also, as of December 26, 2015, we had $88 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and restricted stock units including performance-based restricted stock units that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.99 years.\nInternational Sales\nInternational sales as a percentage of net revenue were 75% in 2015, 81% in 2014 and 85% in 2013. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2015 compared 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease in sales in China. The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by an increase in net revenue from domestic sales of our semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted of money market funds and commercial paper. As of December 26, 2015, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $785 million were lower compared to $1.0 billion as of December 27, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and the timing of related collections and the timing of accounts payable payments made. During 2015, we used $96 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 26, 2015 and 89% as of December 27, 2014.\nOur debt and capital lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $2.3 billion as compared to $2.2 billion as of December 27, 2014. During 2015, we received $100 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes.\nWe believe our cash and cash equivalents balance along with the savings from our restructuring plans and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe that in the event we decide to obtain external funding, we may be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.\nOver the longer term, should additional funding be required, such as to meet payment obligations of our long-term debt when due, we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities, which may be issued from time to time under an effective registration statement, through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or a combination of one or more of the foregoing. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, our business. If market conditions deteriorate, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs on favorable terms or at all, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $226 million in 2015 compared to $98 million in 2014. The increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to lower cash collections during 2015 compared 2014 driven by lower sales compared to 2014, partially offset by lower other operating expenses and labor cost as a result of restructuring actions and the absence of the final $200 million cash payment made in the first quarter of 2014 related to GFs waiver of a portion of our obligations for wafer purchase commitments.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $98 million in 2014 compared to $148 million in 2013. The decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher cash collections during 2014 compared 2013 driven by slightly higher sales compared to 2013, partially offset by the $113 million prepayments to GF in the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $147 million in 2015, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $235 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities, partially offset by a net cash outflow of $88 million for purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $12 million in 2014, which consisted of a cash outflow of $95 million for purchases of property, plant and equipment, offset by a net cash inflow of $83 million from purchases, sales and maturities of available for sale securities.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $455 million in 2013 and primarily consisted of net proceeds of $301 million from the purchase, sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities and net proceeds of $154 million from sales and purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $59 million in 2015, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $100 million, of which $42 million was used to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes during the second quarter of 2015. In addition, during 2015, we received $5 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $46 million in 2014, primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings pursuant to our 6.75% Notes of $589 million, our 7.00% Notes of $491 million and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit of $75 million, partially offset by $518 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 6.00% Notes, $522 million in payments to repurchase our 8.125% Notes, $48 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.75% Notes, $24 million in payments to repurchase a portion of our 7.50% Notes and $3 million in payments for capital lease obligations. During 2014, we also received $4 million from the exercise of employee stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $13 million in 2013, primarily due to net proceeds of $55 million from borrowings pursuant to our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, $3 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation plan and $10 million from other financing activities, including net proceeds from U.S. government grants for research and development activities and foreign grants from the Canadian government for research and development activities related to our AMD APU products. The cash inflows were partially offset by the repurchase of $50 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Notes (which is a portion of our outstanding 6.00% Notes) in open market transactions and $5 million in payments for capital lease obligations.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, we did not realize any excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Therefore, we did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows for these periods.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 26, 2015, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table:\nPayment due by period\n(In millions)\nTotal\nand\nthereafter\n6.75% Notes\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n7.75% Notes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n7.50% Notes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n7.00% Notes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSecured Revolving Line of Credit\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOther long-term liabilities\n-\n-\n-\nAggregate interest obligation(1)\nOperating leases\nPurchase obligations(2)\n-\n-\nObligations to GF(3)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal contractual obligations(4)\n$\n4,059\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,294\n(1)\nRepresents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs.\n(2)\nWe have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. In addition, we have included in the table above obligations for software technology and licenses where payments are fixed and non-cancelable.\n(3)\nIncludes our purchase obligations to GF for wafer manufacturing and research and development activities and reflects the impact of wafer receipts under the fifth amendment to the WSA delayed into fiscal 2016. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which approximately $185 million, consisting of wafers and research and development activities, were received by December 31, 2015. We generally negotiate our purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such we cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.\n(4)\nTotal amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.\n6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015\nOn April 27, 2007, we issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes. In 2015, we paid off the remaining $42 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.00% Notes in cash. As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any 6.00% Notes outstanding.\n6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019\nOn February 26, 2014, we issued $600 million of our 6.75% Notes. Our 6.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March 1, 2019.

(together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on November 12, 2013, as amended on December 11, 2014 (the Loan Agreement) for our Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million, with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit had a maturity date of November 12, 2018. Borrowings under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit were limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves and may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.\nAmended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn April 14, 2015, the Borrowers and ATI Technologies ULC (together with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties), amended and restated the Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and the Agent.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, which remained unchanged from the Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable (90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million.\nThe Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on April 14, 2020 and is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records.\nThe Borrowers may elect a per annum interest rate equal to (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable margin set forth in the applicable chart below (the Applicable Margin) as determined by the average availability under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal quarter period; or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the Agents prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) the Applicable Margin.\nApplicable Margin, if average availability is equal to or greater than 66.66% of the total commitment amount and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal quarter period is greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00, is 0.25% for Base Rate Revolver Loans and 1.25% for LIBOR Revolver Loans. Otherwise, Applicable Margin is determined in accordance with the below table:\nLevel\nAverage\nAvailability for\nLast Fiscal\nMonth\nBase Rate\nRevolver Loans:\nApplicable Margin\nLIBOR\nRevolver Loans:\nApplicable Margin\nI\ngreater than or equal to 66.66% of the Revolver Commitment\n0.5%\n1.5%\nII\ngreater than or equal to 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment, less than 66.66%\n0.75%\n1.75%\nIII\nless than 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment\n1%\n2%\nThe Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be optionally prepaid or terminated, and unutilized commitments may be reduced at any time, in each case without premium or penalty. In connection with the Secured Revolving Line of Credit, the Borrowers will pay an unused line fee equal to 0.375% per annum, payable monthly on the unused amount of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The unused line fee decreases to 0.25% per annum when 35% or more of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit is utilized. The Borrowers will pay (i) a monthly fee on all letters of credit outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit equal to the applicable LIBOR margin and (ii) a fronting fee to the Agent equal to 0.125% of all such letters of\ncredit, payable monthly in arrears.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains covenants that place certain restrictions on the Loan Parties ability to, among other things, allow certain of the Companys subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for the Loan Parties to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount, amend or modify certain terms of any debt of $50 million or more or subordinated debt, create or suffer to exist any liens upon accounts or inventory, sell or transfer any of Loan Parties accounts or inventory other than certain ordinary-course transfers and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain changes to any Loan Partys name or form or state of organization without notifying the Agent, liquidate, dissolve, merge, amalgamate, combine or consolidate, or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions, or modify loan agreements.\nFurther restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. Such restrictions limit the Loan Parties ability to, among other things, create any liens upon any of the Loan Parties property other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes the Secured Revolving Line of Credit), declare or make cash distributions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties ability to enter into any non arms-length transaction with an affiliate.\nThe Loan Parties are required to repurchase, redeem, defease, repay, create a segregated account for the repayment of, or request Agent to reserve a sufficient available amount under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit for the repayment of, all debt for borrowed money exceeding $50 million, by no later than 60 days prior to its maturity date (not including the Secured Revolving Line of Credit). Any reserved funds for this purpose would not be included in domestic cash calculations.\nIn addition, if at any time the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability is less than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million, the Loan Parties must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 until (i) no event of default exists and (ii) the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability is greater than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million for 45 consecutive days.\nThe events of default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement include, among other things, payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, a cross-default related to indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of $50 million, judgments entered against a Loan Party in an amount that exceeds cumulatively $50 million, certain ERISA events and events related to Canadian defined benefits plans and a change of control. When a Payment Condition has not been satisfied, additional events of default include, among other things, a loss, theft damage or destruction with respect to any collateral if the amount not covered by insurance exceeds $50 million.\nFirst Amendment to Amendment and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn June 10, 2015, the Loan Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Amendments to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the First Amendment include the addition of exceptions to the liens and asset sale covenants to permit the Loan Parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements, as well as the addition of certain definitions related thereto.\nAt December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $230 million and $130 million, respectively, at an interest rate of 4.00% and 4.25%, respectively. At December 26, 2015, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit also had $16 million related to outstanding Letters of Credit, and up to $87 million available for future borrowings. We report our intra-period changes in our revolving credit balance on a net basis in our consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 26, 2015, we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement.\nThe agreements governing the 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the\napplicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above primarily consisted of $40 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2018.\nOther long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above exclude amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet that do not require us to make cash payments, which, as of December 26, 2015, primarily consisted of $18 million of deferred gains resulting from certain real estate transactions that occurred in Sunnyvale, California in 1998, in Markham, Ontario, Canada in 2015 and 2008 and in Singapore in 2013. Accruals related to facility consolidation and site closure costs under our restructuring plans of $7 million, deferred rent related to our facilities in Sunnyvale, California of $6 million and operating lease accruals of $5 million are excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above as they are included in the operating leases obligations. Also excluded from other long-term liabilities in the contractual obligations table above are $4 million of environmental reserves and $4 million of non-current unrecognized tax benefits, which represent potential cash payments that could be payable by us upon settlements with the related authorities. We have not included these amounts in the contractual obligations table above because we cannot make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of the settlements with the related authorities, if any.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nWe terminated our capital lease obligations and entered into a non-cancelable operating lease agreement related to one of our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada during 2015. As of December 26, 2015, we did not have any capital lease obligations outstanding.\nOperating Leases\nWe lease certain of our facilities, and in some jurisdictions, we lease the land on which these facilities are built under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. We lease certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancelable lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $306 million, including approximately $251 million of future lease payments and estimated operating costs related to real estate transactions that occurred in Austin, Texas, Sunnyvale, California, Markham, Canada and Singapore.\nPurchase Obligations\nOur purchase obligations primarily include our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties, excluding our wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA. As of December 26, 2015, total non-cancelable purchase obligations were $319 million.\nObligations to GF\nObligations to GF represent all of our expected cash payments to GF based on wafer receipts and research and development activities. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which amount wafers and research and development activities of approximately $185 million were received by December 31, 2015. We are currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA and we expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 26, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 26, 2015, our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the majority of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.\nWe will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk.\nDefault Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in debt and marketable equity securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\nWe actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 26, 2015, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control.\nThere were no sales of available-for-sale securities during 2015.\nThe following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 26, 2015:\n2021 and thereafter\nTotal\nFair Value\n(In millions, except for percentages)\nInvestment Portfolio\nCash equivalents:\nFixed rate amounts\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nWeighted-average rate\n0.27\n%\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n0.27\n%\n0.27\n%\nTotal Investment Portfolio\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nDebt Obligations\nFixed rate amounts\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n2,025\n$\n1,372\nWeighted-average effective interest rate\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n6.75\n%\n7.75\n%\n7.24\n%\n6.88\n%\n10.64\n%\nVariable rate amounts\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nWeighted-average effective interest rate\n4.00\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n4.00\n%\nTotal Debt Obligations\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n2,255\n$\n1,602\nForeign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.\nWe maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy, which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying our strategy, from time to time, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.\nWe also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.\nThe following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.\nDecember 26, 2015\nDecember 27, 2014\nNotional\nAmount\nAverage\nContract\nRate\nEstimated\nFair Value\nGain (Loss)\nNotional\nAmount\nAverage\nContract\nRate\nEstimated\nFair Value\nGain (Loss)\n(In millions except contract rates)\nForeign currency forward contracts:\nCanadian Dollar\n$\n1.2941\n$\n(4.9\n)\n$\n1.1264\n$\n(5.0\n)\nMalaysian Ringgit\n4.0581\n(1.1\n)\n3.5482\n-\nIndian Rupee\n68.856\n0.2\n64.1608\n(1.1\n)\nSingapore Dollar\n1.4033\n(0.1\n)\n1.313\n(0.4\n)\nTaiwan Dollar\n31.868\n(0.4\n)\n31.1284\n(0.4\n)\nChinese Renminbi\n-\n-\n-\n6.1906\n0.1\nTotal\n$\n$\n(6.3\n)\n$\n$\n(6.8\n)\nIn addition, we use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed rate interest payments of a portion of our 6.75% Notes to floating rate interest payments based on LIBOR. The notional amount of the interest rate swap we entered into was $250 million as of December 26, 2015. The interest rate swaps are designated as a fair value hedge. All changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets with no net impact to our consolidated statements of operations.

References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company primarily offers:\n(i)\nx86 microprocessors, as a standalone central processing unit (CPU) or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, and discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer, commercial and professional graphics markets; and\n(ii)\nserver and embedded CPUs, GPUs and APUs, and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.\nNOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively, each consisted of 52 weeks.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Companys accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill, valuation of investments in marketable securities, deferred income taxes and restructuring charges.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to customers, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured. Estimates of product returns, allowances and future price reductions, based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trends and factors, are recorded at the time revenue is recognized. The Company sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The distributor agreements, which may be cancelled by either party upon specified notice, generally contain a provision for the return of those of the Companys products that the Company has removed from its price book and that are not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Therefore, the Company is unable to estimate the product returns and pricing when the product is sold to the distributors. Accordingly, the Company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product costs from sales to distributors with agreements that have the aforementioned terms until the merchandise is resold by the distributors and reports such deferred amounts as Deferred income on shipments to distributors on its consolidated balance sheet. Products are sold to distributors at standard published prices that are contained in price books that are broadly provided to the Companys various distributors. Distributors are then required to pay for these products within the Companys standard contractual terms, which are typically net 60 days. The Company records allowances for price protection given to distributors and customer rebates in the period of distributor re-sale. The Company determines these allowances based on specific contractual terms with its distributors. Price reductions generally do not result in sales prices that are less than the Companys product cost. Deferred income on shipments to distributors is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory units at distributors, latest published prices and latest product costs.\nThe Company records estimated reductions to revenue under distributor and customer incentive programs, including certain cooperative advertising and marketing promotions and volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements, at the time the related revenues are recognized. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customers cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales.\nDeferred revenue and related product costs were as follows:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nDeferred revenue\n$\n$\nDeferred cost of sales\n(41\n)\n(58\n)\nDeferred income on shipments to distributors\n$\n$\nInventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment present. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If step one indicates that impairment potentially exists, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment, if any. Goodwill impairment exists when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\nCommitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also a party to environmental matters, including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies, if any, that would be charged to earnings, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Changes in required reserves could increase or decrease the Companys earnings in the period the changes are made. (See Notes 15 and 16).\nRestructuring Charges. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance costs, contract and program termination costs, asset impairments and costs of facility consolidation and closure. Restructuring charges are recorded upon approval of a formal management plan and are included in the operating results of the period in which such plan is approved and the expense becomes estimable. To estimate restructuring charges, management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities. Severance and other employee separation costs are accrued when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on the Companys policies and practices and negotiated settlements.\nCash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nInvestments in Certain Debt and Equity Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.\nThe Company classifies investments in debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Companys intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months.\nDerivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into\nconsideration all of the Companys consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn applying its strategy, the Company used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designated these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings.\nThe Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: equipment, two to six years; buildings and building improvements, up to 40 years; and leasehold improvements, measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements.\nAssets Held for Sale. Assets held for sale represents components that meet accounting requirements to be classified as held for sale and presented as single asset and liability amounts in the Companys financial statements at lower of carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The determination of fair value involves significant judgments and assumptions. In determining the fair value less cost to sell, the Company considered factors including, among others, the nature of the sales transaction, the composition of assets and/or businesses in the disposal group, current sales prices for comparable assets and/or businesses and negotiations with third party purchaser(s).\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Companys assets held for sale included in other current assets and liabilities related to assets held for sale included in other current liabilities amounted to $183 million and $79 million, respectively. See Note 4 Equity Interest Purchase Agreement below, for additional information.\nProduct Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Companys approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end users for only those central processing unit (CPU) and AMD accelerated processing unit (APU) products that are commonly referred to as processors in a box and for certain server CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of tray microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who have written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets. The Company accrues warranty costs at the time of sale of warranted products.\nForeign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings.\nForeign Subsidies. The Company received investment grants in connection with the construction and operation of certain facilities in Asia. Generally, such grants are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other conditions specified in the relevant grant documents. Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded, a current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales.\nThe Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met.\nMarketing, Communications and Advertising Expenses. Marketing, communications and advertising expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $154 million, $194 million and $210 million, respectively. Cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs are accrued and the costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash\npaid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nNet Loss Per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued by the Company to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in connection with the GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF) transaction in 2009. On March 7, 2014, the Company issued 34,906,166 shares of common stock pursuant to the cashless exercise in full by WCH of its warrant to purchase up to 35,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. As a result, the warrant is no longer outstanding. The issuance of the common stock did not have any effect on basic and dilutive earnings per share amounts because the full 35,000,000 shares of common stock issuable to WCH had already been included in the denominator for calculating basic and dilutive earnings per share for all periods presented.\nDiluted net income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Potentially dilutive shares include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible debt.\nThe following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted loss per share:\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNumerator-Net loss:\nNumerator for basic and diluted net loss per share\n$\n(660\n)\n$\n(403\n)\n$\n(83\n)\nDenominator-Weighted-average shares:\nDenominator for basic and diluted net loss per share\nNet loss per share:\nBasic\n$\n(0.84\n)\n$\n(0.53\n)\n$\n(0.11\n)\nDiluted\n$\n(0.84\n)\n$\n(0.53\n)\n$\n(0.11\n)\nPotential shares from outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units totaling approximately 52 million, 48 million and 59 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, were not included in the net loss per share calculations as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Companys available-for-sale securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive loss.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component for the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\nUnrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities\nUnrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges\nTotal\nUnrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities\nUnrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n(5\n)\n$\n$\n(3\n)\n$\n(2\n)\nUnrealized gains (losses) arising during the period, net of tax effects\n(2\n)\n(22\n)\n(24\n)\n-\n(9\n)\n(9\n)\nReclassification adjustment for (gains) losses realized and included in net loss, net of tax effects\n-\n-\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n(2\n)\n(1\n)\n(3\n)\n-\n(3\n)\n(3\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(7\n)\n$\n(8\n)\n$\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n(5\n)\nStock-Based Compensation. The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the options fair-value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock and restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Companys common\nstock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units that involve a market condition using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method.\nThe application of the lattice-binomial option-pricing model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility of the Companys common stock, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. Significant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock options granted in the future.\nForfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates in order to derive the Companys best estimate of awards ultimately expected to vest.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIncome Tax. In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the consolidated balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 will be effective in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 may be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2015-17 on its consolidated financial statements.\nInventory. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which simplifies the measurement of inventory by requiring certain inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 will be effective in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2015-11 on its consolidated financial statements.\nInterest-Imputation of Interest. In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016, at which time the Company will reclassify approximately $30 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Companys long-term debt from other non-current assets to long-term debt. A reclassification will also be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented.\nDisclosure of Going Concern Uncertainties. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15), which provides guidance on managements responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a companys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 will be effective in the fourth quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements.\nShare-Based Payments with Performance Targets. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which requires that a performance target be treated as a performance condition if it affects vesting and could be achieved after the requisite service period is rendered. ASU 2014-12 will be effective in the first quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company may use either of two methods: (i) prospective application to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (ii) retrospective application to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter, with the cumulative effect of applying ASU 2014-12 as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements. The Company evaluated the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-12 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined which method it will apply. The adoption of this standard will not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that revenue should be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step process in order to achieve this core principle, which may require the use of judgment and estimates. ASU 2014-09 also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures relating to the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including significant judgments and estimates used. In July 2015, FASB announced a decision to defer the effective date for this ASU. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first\nquarter of 2018 with early adoption permitted (for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016). The Company may adopt ASU 2014-09 either by using a full retrospective approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined which approach it will apply.\nNOTE 3: GLOBALFOUNDRIES\nFormation and Accounting\nOn March 2, 2009, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement among the Company, Advanced Technology Investment Company LLC (currently known as Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech)) and West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), pursuant to which the Company formed GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, the Company, Mubadala Tech and GF entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA), a Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) and a Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) on March 2, 2009.\nAt GFs formation on March 2, 2009 and through December 26, 2009, GF was deemed a variable-interest entity, and the Company was deemed to be GFs primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated GF under applicable accounting rules. As a result of certain GF governance changes, the Company deconsolidated GF and accounted for its GF ownership under the equity method of accounting as of December 27, 2009. Following the deconsolidation, GF became the Companys related party.\nIn the first quarter of 2011, as a result of a contribution to GF by an affiliate of Mubadala Tech and certain GF governance changes noted above, the Companys ownership in GF was diluted, and the Company concluded that it no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over GF. Accordingly, the Company changed the accounting for the investment in GF from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized a dilution gain in investee of approximately $492 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company identified indicators of impairment in GF that were deemed other than temporary. The Company performed a valuation analysis and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $209 million. The carrying value of the Companys remaining investment in GF after the impairment charge was $278 million as of December 31, 2011.\nOn March 4, 2012, as partial consideration for certain rights received under a second amendment to the WSA, the Company transferred to GF all of the remaining capital stock of GF that the Company owned. In addition, as of March 4, 2012, the Funding Agreement was terminated, and the Company was no longer party to the Shareholders Agreement. As a result of these transactions, the Company no longer owned any GF capital stock as of March 4, 2012.\nGF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala) and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, the Companys largest stockholder. WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala.\nWafer Supply Agreement\nThe WSA governs the terms by which the Company purchases products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, the Company is required to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If the Company acquires a third party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, the Company will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF.\nThe WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but the Companys purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply.\nThird Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On December 6, 2012, the Company entered into a third amendment to the WSA. Pursuant to the third amendment, the Company modified its wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012 made pursuant to the second amendment to the WSA. In addition, the Company agreed to certain pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for its microprocessor and APU products to be delivered by GF to the Company from the fourth quarter of 2012 through December 31, 2013. Pursuant to the third amendment, GF agreed to waive a portion of the Companys wafer purchase commitments for the fourth quarter of 2012. In consideration for this waiver, the Company agreed to pay GF a fee of $320 million. As a result, the Company recorded a lower of cost or market charge of $273 million for the write-down of inventory to its market value in the fourth quarter of 2012. The cash impact of this $320 million fee was paid over several quarters, with $80 million paid on December 28, 2012, $40 million paid on April 1, 2013 and $200 million paid on December 31, 2013.\nFourth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On March 30, 2014, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fourth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2014 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of the Companys microprocessor unit, graphics processor unit and semi-custom game console products to be delivered by GF to the Company during the 2014 calendar year.\nFifth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to the WSA. The primary effect of the fifth amendment was to establish volume purchase commitments and fixed pricing for the 2015 calendar year as well as to modify certain other terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for some of the Companys microprocessor unit, graphics processor unit and semi-custom products to be delivered by GF to the Company during the 2015 calendar year.\nAs of December 26, 2015, certain wafer deliveries under the fifth amendment to the WSA have been delayed until fiscal 2016. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which approximately $185 million, consisting of wafers and research and development activities, were received by December 31, 2015.\nThe Company generally negotiates its purchase commitments with GF on an annual basis and as such the Company cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate its future purchase obligations to GF. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a sixth amendment to the WSA, and it expects that its future purchases from GF will continue to be material.\nThe Companys total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were $0.9 billion for 2015 and $1 billion for each 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNOTE 4: Equity Interest Purchase Agreement\nOn October 15, 2015, the Company entered into an Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (the Equity Interest Purchase Agreement) with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., a Chinese joint stock company (JV Party), under which the Company will sell to JV Party a majority of the equity interests in AMD Technologies (China) Co. Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise incorporated as a limited liability company (the Chinese Target Company), and Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian limited liability company (the Malaysian Target Company and, together with the Chinese Target Company, the Target Companies), thereby forming two joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with JV Party in a transaction valued at approximately $436 million (the Transaction). The JV Party will acquire 85% of the equity interests in each JV for approximately $371 million and the Company estimates it will receive approximately $320 million cash, net of taxes and other customary expenses. After closing, JV Partys affiliates will own 85% of the equity interests in each JV while certain of the Companys subsidiaries will own the remaining 15%. The Transaction will result in the JVs providing assembly, testing, marking, packing and packaging services (ATMP) to the Company. The Company plans to account for its investment in the JVs under the equity method of accounting.\nThe Equity Interest Purchase Agreement also has related agreements including: (i) with respect to the Malaysian Target Company, a Shareholders Agreement, and with respect to the Chinese Target Company, a Joint Venture Contract governing the joint venture relationships from and after the Closing, (ii) an IP License Agreement, (iii) a Manufacturing Services Agreement, (iv) a Transition Services Agreement, and (v) a Trademark License Agreement.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2016, pending all regulatory and other approvals.\nAs a result of the decision to form the above JVs, the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015 reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which requires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. The Company reclassified $183 million to other current assets and $79 million to other current liabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets primarily consist of property, plant, and equipment of $110 million, goodwill allocation of $42 million and inventory of $15 million. Liability balances reclassified into other current liabilities primarily consist of accounts payable of $70 million. The balances included in the final gain/(loss) calculation, at closing, are likely to be different due to normal operational activities occurring through the closing date.\nNOTE 5: Supplemental Balance Sheet Information\nInventories\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nRaw materials\n$\n$\nWork in process\nFinished goods\nTotal inventories, net\n$\n$\nOther current assets\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nAssets held-for-sale\n$\n$\n-\nOther current assets\nTotal other current assets\n$\n$\nProperty, plant and equipment\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nLand and land improvements\n$\n$\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\nEquipment\n1,416\nConstruction in progress\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross\n1,680\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(796\n)\n(1,378\n)\nTotal property, plant and equipment, net\n$\n$\nDepreciation expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $94 million, $115 million and $139 million, respectively.\nOther assets\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nSoftware and technology licenses\n$\n$\nOther\nTotal other assets\n$\n$\nAccrued liabilities\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n$\n$\nMarketing programs and advertising expenses\nSoftware technology and licenses payable\nOther accrued and current liabilities\nTotal accrued liabilities\n$\n$\nOther current liabilities\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nLiabilities related to assets held-for-sale\n$\n$\n-\nOther current liabilities\nTotal other current liabilities\n$\n$\nNOTE 6: Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 were as follows:\nComputing and Graphics\nEnterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom\nAll Other\nTotal\n(In millions)\nInitial goodwill due to ATI acquisition\n$\n1,194\n$\n$\n$\n2,194\nInitial goodwill due to SeaMicro acquisition\n-\n1,359\n2,424\nAccumulated impairment losses\n(1,126\n)\n-\n(745\n)\n(1,871\n)\nBalance as of December 28, 2013\n-\nImpairment charges\n(233\n)\n-\n-\n(233\n)\nBalance as of December 27, 2014\n-\n-\nAssets held-for-sale\n-\n(42\n)\n-\n(42\n)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n-\n-\nAccumulated impairment losses\n$\n(1,359\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(745\n)\n$\n(2,104\n)\nAs a result of the decision to form the JVs with Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd., the balance sheet as of December 26, 2015 reflects held-for-sale accounting of the ATMP assets and liabilities which requires reclassification of such financial amounts to current assets and current liabilities. Asset balances reclassified into other current assets included goodwill of $42 million.\nIn the third quarter of 2014, the Companys realignment of its organizational structure, effective July 1, 2014, caused a change in the composition of the Companys reportable segments and reporting units. This represented a change in circumstance requiring the reassignment of the goodwill to the new reporting units using a relative fair value approach and an interim goodwill impairment analysis before and after the Companys reorganization. The Company completed this goodwill impairment analysis during the third quarter of 2014. For purposes of this analysis, the Companys estimates of fair value were based on the income approach, which estimates the fair value of the Companys reporting units based on future discounted cash flows. The Company determined that each reporting units estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill. In step one of the impairment test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the reporting units to its carrying value. The Company determined that the carrying value of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit exceeded its fair value, indicating potential goodwill impairment existed based on a combination of factors such as a decline in stock price. Therefore, the Company performed the second step of the impairment test, in which the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit on a fair value basis, including any unrecognized intangible assets, with any excess representing the implied fair value of goodwill. The fair value was determined using an income approach, which estimates the present value of future cash flows based on managements forecast of revenue growth rates and operating margins. Based on this analysis, the implied fair value of the goodwill of the Computing and Graphics reporting unit was zero. The Company concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Computing and Graphics segment exceeded the implied fair values and recorded an impairment charge of $233 million, which is included in Goodwill impairment charge on the Companys consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the remaining two reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to these reporting units. In connection with completing the goodwill\nimpairment analysis, the Company reviewed its long-lived tangible and intangible assets within the Computing and Graphics reporting unit under ASC 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company determined that the forecasted undiscounted cash flows related to these assets or asset groups were in excess of their carrying values, and therefore these assets were not impaired.\nIn the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2013, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill. Based on the results of the Companys analysis of goodwill, each reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment in 2015 and 2013.\nAcquisition-related intangible assets\nAs a part of the Companys strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company decided to exit the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in Restructuring and other special charges, net on the Companys consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property.\nThe balances of acquisition-related intangible assets as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 were as follows:\nDecember 26, 2015\nDecember 27, 2014\nGross\nImpairment charges\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet\nWeighted-average amortization period\nGross\nAccumulated Amortization\nNet\n(In millions, except years)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n$\n(54\n)\n$\n(204\n)\n$\n-\n5.15 years\n$\n$\n(201\n)\n$\nIn-process research and development\n(6\n)\n-\n-\nN/A\n-\nCustomer relationships\n(1\n)\n(167\n)\n-\n1.25 years\n(167\n)\nTrademark and trade name\n(1\n)\n(36\n)\n-\n1.25 years\n(36\n)\nTotal\n$\n$\n(62\n)\n$\n(407\n)\n$\n-\n4.56 years\n$\n$\n(404\n)\n$\nThe following table summarizes amortization expense associated with acquisition-related intangible assets:\n(In millions)\nDeveloped technology\n$\n$\n$\nCustomer relationships\n-\nTrademark and trade name\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n$\n$\nNOTE 7: Financial Instruments\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 are summarized below:\nTotal Fair\nValue\nCash and\nCash\nEquivalents\n(In millions)\nDecember 26, 2015\nCash\n$\n$\nLevel 2(2) (3)\nCommercial paper\nTotal level 2\nTotal\n$\n$\nTotal Fair\nValue\nCash and\nCash\nEquivalents\nShort-Term\nMarketable\nSecurities\n(In millions)\nDecember 27, 2014\nCash\n$\n$\n$\n-\nLevel 1(1) (2)\nMoney market funds\n-\nTotal level 1\n-\nLevel 2(2) (3)\nCommercial paper\nCorporate bonds\n-\nTotal level 2\nTotal\n$\n1,040\n$\n$\n(1)\nThe Companys Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n(2)\nThe Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during 2015 and 2014.\n(3)\nThe Companys Level 2 short-term investments are valued using broker reports that utilize quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments. Brokers gather observable inputs for all of the Companys fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers and other third-party sources.\nAvailable-for-sale securities held by the Company as of December 26, 2015 consisted of commercial paper and as of December 27, 2014 also consisted of money market funds and corporate bonds. The amortized cost of available-for-sale securities approximates the fair value for all periods presented.\nIn addition to those amounts presented above, as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had approximately $1 million and $10 million, respectively, of available-for-sale investments in money market funds, used as collateral for leased buildings and letters of credit deposits, which were included in Other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. These money market funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized costs are the same as the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these deposits.\nAlso in addition to those amounts presented above, at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had approximately $15 million and $16 million, respectively, of available-for-sale investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Companys deferred compensation plan, which were also included in Other assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. These mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its debt. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are as follows:\nDecember 26, 2015\nDecember 27, 2014\nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCarrying\nAmount\nEstimated\nFair Value\n(In millions)\nShort-term debt (excluding capital leases)\n$\n$\n$\n$\nLong-term debt (excluding capital leases)\n$\n2,025\n$\n1,372\n$\n2,025\n$\n1,858\nThe Companys short-term and long-term debt are classified within Level 2. The fair value of the debt was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the Companys accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing payment terms.\nHedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe following table shows the amount of gain (loss) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and included in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges and the amount of gain (loss) included in other income (expense), net, related to contracts not designated as hedging instruments, which was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations:\n(In millions)\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts - gains (losses)\nContracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(3\n)\nCost of sales\n(4\n)\n-\nResearch and development\n(10\n)\n(3\n)\nMarketing, general and administrative\n(7\n)\n(3\n)\nContracts not designated as hedging instruments\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(3\n)\n$\n(3\n)\nThe Companys foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets, such as currency spot and forward rates.\nThe following table shows the fair value amounts included in Other current assets should the foreign currency forward contracts be in a gain position or included in Other current liabilities should these contracts be in a loss position. As of December 26, 2015, the Companys outstanding contracts were in a net loss position of $6 million. These amounts were recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts - gains (losses)\nContracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments\n$\n(6\n)\n$\n(6\n)\nContracts not designated as hedging instruments\n$\n-\n$\n(1\n)\nFor the foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portions of the hedging relationship and the amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were immaterial.\nAs of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the notional values of the Companys outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $156 million and $298 million, respectively. All the contracts mature within 12 months, and, upon maturity, the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified into earnings. The Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum of 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nIn the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps on a notional amount of $250 million to hedge a portion of the Companys 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes). The purpose of these swaps is to manage\na portion of the Companys exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed rate interest payments to floating rate interest payments. The swaps effectively converted a portion of the fixed interest payments payable on the 6.75% Notes into variable interest payments based on LIBOR. The interest rate swaps are designated as a fair value hedge. Because the specific terms and notional amount of the swaps are intended to match the portion of the 6.75% Notes being hedged, it is assumed to be a highly effective hedge. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the 6.75% Notes. All changes in fair value of the swaps are recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheets with no net impact to the Companys consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Companys fair value hedge derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets.\nThe following table shows the fair value amounts included in Other assets should the fair value hedge derivative contracts be in a gain position or included in Other long-term liabilities should these contracts be in a loss position. These amounts were recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts - gains (losses)\nContracts designated as fair value hedging instruments\n$\n$\nNOTE 8: Concentrations of Credit and Operation Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in debt securities, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.\nThe Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. The Company invests in time deposits and certificates of deposit from banks having combined capital, surplus and undistributed profits of not less than $200 million. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1 or better. The Company invests in tax-exempt securities, including municipal notes and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Companys customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. Accounts receivable from the Companys top three customers accounted for approximately 20%, 16% and 10% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 26, 2015 and 28%, 17% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 27, 2014. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience, and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments, if deemed necessary.\nThe Companys existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative instruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Companys credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, thus creating a receivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors, including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Companys counterparties, the Company determined its counterparty credit risk to be immaterial. At December 26, 2015, the Companys obligations under the contracts exceeded the counterparties obligations by $6 million.\nThe Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for its internal back-end manufacturing operations. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of the Companys graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If the Company or its third-party manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure certain of these materials, or its foundries are unable to procure materials for manufacturing its products, its business would be materially adversely affected.\nNOTE 9: Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of:\n(In millions)\nCurrent:\nU.S. Federal\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(1\n)\n$\n(2\n)\nU.S. State and Local\n-\n-\n-\nForeign National and Local\nTotal\nDeferred:\nU.S. Federal\n-\n-\nForeign National and Local\n(1\n)\n-\n(2\n)\nTotal\n(1\n)\n-\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nLoss before income taxes consists of the following:\n(In millions)\nU.S.\n$\n(1,100\n)\n$\n(621\n)\n$\n(397\n)\nForeign\nTotal pre-tax loss\n$\n(646\n)\n$\n(398\n)\n$\n(74\n)\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes.

Non-current deferred tax assets are included in the caption Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 26, 2015, substantially all of the Companys U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which, at December 26, 2015, in managements estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2015, the net valuation allowance increased by $174 million primarily for increases in deferred tax assets related to the net operating losses generated from pre-tax book losses in the U.S. In 2014, the net valuation allowance increased by $120 million primarily for increases in deferred tax assets related to net operating losses generated from pre-tax book losses in the U.S. In 2013, the net valuation allowance decreased by $26 million primarily for decreases in deferred tax assets related to the utilization of net operating losses due to pre-tax book income in Canada.\nAs of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had $118 million and $127 million, respectively, of deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance that related to excess stock option deductions, which are not presented in the deferred tax asset balances.\nThe following is a summary of the various tax attribute carryforwards the Company had as of December 26, 2015. The amounts presented below include amounts related to excess stock option deductions, as discussed above.\nCarryforward\nFederal\nState /\nProvincial\nExpiration\n(In millions)\nU.S.-net operating loss carryovers\n$\n6,478\n$\n2016 to 2035\nU.S.-credit carryovers\n$\n$\n2016 to 2035\nCanada-net operating loss carryovers\n$\n$\n2027 to 2028\nCanada-credit carryovers\n$\n$\n2021 to 2035\nCanada-R&D pools\n$\n$\nno expiration\nBarbados-net operating loss carryovers\n$\nN/A\n2016 to 2017\nOther foreign net operating loss carryovers\n$\nN/A\nvarious\nUtilization of $12 million of the Companys U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations as a result of the ATI Technologies ULC (ATI) acquisition.\nThe table below displays reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total provision (benefit) for income taxes.\n(In millions)\nStatutory federal income tax benefit at 35% rate\n$\n(226\n)\n$\n(139\n)\n$\n(26\n)\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\nForeign (income) expense at other than U.S. rates\nU.S. valuation allowance generated\nCredit monetization\n(2\n)\n(2\n)\n(3\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n$\n$\nThe Company has made no provision for U.S. income taxes on approximately $307 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries through December 26, 2015 because it is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. If such earnings were distributed, the Company would incur additional income taxes of approximately $107 million (after an adjustment for foreign tax credits). These additional income taxes may not result in income tax expense or a cash payment to the Internal Revenue Service, but may result in the utilization of deferred tax assets that are currently subject to a valuation allowance.\nThe Company partially recognized undistributed earnings within certain subsidiaries in China of $56 million through December 26, 2015 because the announcement in October 2015 of an agreement to sell 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou causes the Company to modify its judgment that associated undistributed earnings of that subsidiarys holding company in China will remain indefinitely reinvested. A future distribution of these earnings will give rise to an associated future withholding tax of $6 million. This is recognized as an income tax expense within the 2015 income tax provision. The same event results in the Chinese holding company recognizing the future benefit of tax losses available to offset taxable gains when the deal closes. The future benefit of those losses is $7 million and is a reduction in the 2015 income tax provision. The net effect of this event in the 2015 income tax provision is a reduction of $1 million.\nThe Companys operations in Malaysia currently operate under a tax holiday, which will expire in 2018. This tax holiday may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net impact of the tax holiday did not decrease the Companys net loss in 2015 because the Companys operations in Malaysia operated at a net loss. The net impact of tax holidays decreased the Companys net loss by $2 million in 2014, less than $.01 per share, diluted, and decreased the Companys net loss by $1 million in 2013, less than $.01 per share, diluted.\nA reconciliation of the gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n$\n$\nIncreases for tax positions taken in prior years\nDecreases for tax positions taken in prior years\n(1\n)\n-\n(2\n)\nIncreases for tax positions taken in the current year\nDecreases for settlements with taxing authorities\n(2\n)\n(27\n)\n(7\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n$\n$\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $4 million, $3 million and $3 million as of December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively. The Company had no or immaterial amounts of accrued interest and no accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013. The Company recognizes the accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.\nDuring the 12 months beginning December 27, 2015, the Company does not expect to reduce its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolutions and/or closure of open audits are highly uncertain.\nAs of December 27, 2014, the Canada Revenue Agency, or CRA, had completed its audit of ATI for the years 2005 through 2010 and issued its final Notice of Assessment, which the Company has reviewed and agreed to. As of December 26, 2015, the Italian tax authorities had concluded their audit of the Companys subsidiaries activities in Italy for the years 2003 through 2013. The Company has agreed to a settlement of $11 million in taxes and penalties and $2 million in interest. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign, foreign provincial, and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has\nprovided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company has not recognized any current or long-term deferred tax assets under a valuation allowance as a result of the application of uncertainty in income taxes in ASC 740 for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015.\nNOTE 10: Debt and Other Obligations\nTotal Debt\nThe Companys total debt as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 consisted of:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\n6.00% Notes, net of discount\n$\n-\n$\n6.75% Notes\n6.75% Notes, interest rate swap\n7.75% Notes\n7.50% Notes\n7.00% Notes\nSecured Revolving Line of Credit\nCapital lease obligations\n-\nTotal debt\n2,262\n2,212\nLess: current portion\nTotal debt, less current portion\n$\n2,032\n$\n2,035\n6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2015\nOn April 27, 2007, the Company issued $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of the 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes (6.00% Notes). In 2015, the Company paid off the remaining $42 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.00% Notes in cash. As of December 26, 2015, the Company did not have any 6.00% Notes outstanding.\n6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019\nOn February 26, 2014, the Company issued $600 million of its 6.75% Notes. The 6.75% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March 1, 2019. The 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.75% Notes was $600 million.\nAt any time before March 1, 2019, the Company may redeem some or all of the 6.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium (as set forth in the 6.75% Indenture).\nHolders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 6.75% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, as defined in the 6.75% Indenture, at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.75% Notes.\nThe 6.75% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries, to:\nincur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt;\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\nmake certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied;\ncreate or permit certain liens;\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company;\nuse the proceeds from sales of assets;\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and\nconsolidate, merge or sell its assets as entirety or substantially as an entirety.\n7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020\nOn August 4, 2010, the Company issued $500 million of its 7.75% Senior Notes Due 2020 (7.75% Notes). The 7.75% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year beginning February 1, 2011 until the maturity date of August 1, 2020. The 7.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.75% Indenture) dated August 4, 2010 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.\nDuring 2014, the Company repurchased $50 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.75% Notes in open market transactions for $49 million, which included payment of accrued and unpaid interest of $1 million. The Company recorded a total gain of $2 million in connection with the foregoing repurchase of the 7.75% Notes. As of December 26, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.75% Notes was $450 million.\nFrom August 1, 2015, the Company may redeem the 7.75% Notes at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nPeriod\nPrice as\nPercentage of\nPrincipal Amount\nBeginning on August 1, 2015 through July 31, 2016\n103.875\n%\nBeginning on August 1, 2016 through July 31, 2017\n102.583\n%\nBeginning on August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018\n101.292\n%\nOn August 1, 2018 and thereafter\n100.000\n%\nHolders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.75% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, as defined in the 7.75% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.75% Notes.\nThe 7.75% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries, from:\nincurring additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt;\npaying dividends and making other restricted payments;\nmaking certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied;\ncreating or permitting certain liens;\ncreating or permitting restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company;\nusing the proceeds from sales of assets;\nentering into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and\nconsolidating, merging or selling its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety.\n7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022\nOn August 15, 2012, the Company issued $500 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.\nDuring 2014, the Company repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of its 7.50% Notes in open market transactions for $24 million. The payment of accrued and unpaid interest included in the purchase price was immaterial. The Company incurred a total gain of $1 million in connection with the foregoing repurchase of the 7.50% Notes. As of December 26, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $475 million. Prior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture).\nHolders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, as defined in the 7.50% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50% Notes.\nThe 7.50% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries, to:\nincur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt;\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\nmake certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied;\ncreate or permit certain liens;\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company;\nuse the proceeds from sales of assets;\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and\nconsolidate, merge or sell its assets as entirety or substantially as an entirety.\n7.00% Senior Notes Due 2024\nOn June 16, 2014, the Company issued $500 million of its7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes). The 7.00% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2015 until the maturity date of July 1, 2024. The 7.00% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.00% Indenture) dated June 16, 2014 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes was $500 million.\nAt any time before July 1, 2017, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes within 90 days of the closing of an equity offering with the net proceeds thereof at a redemption price equal to 107.000% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of redemption. Prior to July 1, 2019, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.00% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium (as set forth in the 7.00% Indenture).\nStarting July 1, 2019, the Company may redeem the 7.00% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest:\nPeriod\nPrice as\nPercentage of\nPrincipal Amount\nBeginning on July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020\n103.500\n%\nBeginning on July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021\n102.333\n%\nBeginning on July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022\n101.167\n%\nOn July 1, 2022 and thereafter\n100.000\n%\nHolders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.00% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, as defined in the 7.00% Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.00% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.00% Notes.\nThe 7.00% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Companys ability and the ability of its subsidiaries, to:\nincur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt;\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\nmake certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied;\ncreate or permit certain liens;\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company;\nuse the proceeds from sales of assets;\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and\nconsolidate, merge or sell its assets as entirety or substantially as an entirety.\nThe 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes rank equally with the Companys existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Companys future subordinated debt. The 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes rank junior to all of the Companys future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries.\nPotential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes\nThe Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes and 7.00% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries, or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so.\nSecured Revolving Line of Credit\nLoan and Security Agreement\nThe Company and its subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), entered into a loan and security agreement on November 12, 2013, as amended on December 11, 2014 (the Loan Agreement), for a secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit), with up to $75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, with a group of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders (the Agent). The Secured Revolving Line of Credit had a maturity date of November 12, 2018. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit were limited to up to 85% of eligible account receivable minus certain reserves. The borrowings of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs.\nAmended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn April 14, 2015, the Borrowers and ATI Technologies ULC (together with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties) amended and restated the Loan Agreement (the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) by and among the Loan Parties, the financial institutions party thereto from time to time as lenders (the Lenders) and the Agent.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement provides for a Secured Revolving Line of Credit for a principal amount of up to $500 million with up to$75 million available for issuance of letters of credit, which remained unchanged from the Loan Agreement. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are limited to up to 85% of eligible accounts receivable (90% for certain qualified eligible accounts receivable), minus specified reserves. The size of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million.\nThe Secured Revolving Line of Credit matures on April 14, 2020 and is secured by a first priority security interest in the Loan Parties accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts maintained with the Agent and other specified assets, including books and records.\nThe Borrowers may elect a per annum interest rate equal to (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus the applicable margin set forth in the chart below (the Applicable Margin) as determined by the average availability under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal-quarter period; or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the Agents prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) the Applicable Margin.\nApplicable Margin, if average availability is equal to or greater than 66.66% of the total commitment amount and the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended four-fiscal quarter period is greater than or equal to 1.25 to 1.00, is 0.25% for Base Rate Revolver Loans and 1.25% for LIBOR Revolver Loans. Otherwise, Applicable Margin is determined in accordance with the below table:\nLevel\nAverage\nAvailability for\nLast Fiscal\nMonth\nBase Rate\nRevolver Loans:\nApplicable Margin\nLIBOR\nRevolver Loans:\nApplicable Margin\nI\ngreater than or equal to 66.66% of the Revolver Commitment\n0.5%\n1.5%\nII\ngreater than or equal to 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment, less than 66.66%\n0.75%\n1.75%\nIII\nless than 33.33% of the Revolver Commitment\n1%\n2%\nThe Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be optionally prepaid or terminated, and unutilized commitments may be reduced at any time, in each case without premium or penalty. In connection with the Secured Revolving Line of Credit, the Borrowers will pay an unused line fee equal to 0.375% per annum, payable monthly on the unused amount of the commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The unused line fee decreases to 0.25% per annum when 35% or more of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit is utilized. The Borrowers will pay (i) a monthly fee on all letters of credit outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit equal to the applicable LIBOR margin and (ii) a fronting fee to the Agent equal to 0.125% of all such letters of credit, payable monthly in arrears.\nThe Amended and Restated Loan Agreement contains covenants that place certain restrictions on the Loan Parties ability to, among other things, allow certain of the Companys subsidiaries that manufacture or process inventory for the Loan Parties to borrow secured debt or unsecured debt beyond a certain amount, amend or modify certain terms of any debt of $50 million or more or subordinated debt, create or suffer to exist any liens upon accounts or inventory, sell or transfer any of Loan Parties accounts or inventory other than certain ordinary-course transfers and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain changes to any Loan Partys name or form or state of organization without notifying the Agent, liquidate, dissolve, merge, amalgamate, combine or consolidate, or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties ability to incur or repay debt, grant liens, make distributions, or modify loan agreements.\nFurther restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) is greater than the greater of 20% of the total commitment amount and $100 million. Such restrictions limit the Loan Parties ability to, among other things, create any liens upon any of the Loan Parties property other than customary permitted liens and liens on up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt (which amount includes the Secured Revolving Line of Credit), declare or make cash distributions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements, make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date or become a party to certain agreements restricting the Loan Parties ability to enter into any non arms-length transaction with an affiliate.\nThe Loan Parties are required to repurchase, redeem, defease, repay, create a segregated account for the repayment of, or request Agent to reserve a sufficient available amount under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit for the repayment of, all debt for borrowed money exceeding $50 million, by no later than 60 days prior to its maturity date (not including the Secured Revolving Line of Credit). Any reserved funds for this purpose would not be included in domestic cash calculations.\nIn addition, if at any time the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability is less than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million, the Loan Parties must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 until (i) no event of default exists and (ii) the Loan Parties Excess Cash Availability is greater than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million for 45 consecutive days.\nThe events of default under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement include, among other things, payment defaults, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, a cross-default related to indebtedness in an aggregate amount in excess of $50 million, judgments entered against a Loan Party in an amount that exceeds cumulatively $50 million, certain ERISA events and events related to Canadian defined benefits plans and a change of control. When a Payment Condition has not been satisfied, additional events of default include, among other things, a loss, theft damage or destruction with respect to any collateral if the amount not covered by insurance exceeds $50 million.\nFirst Amendment to Amendment and Restated Loan and Security Agreement\nOn June 10, 2015, the Loan Parties entered into a First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) by and among the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agent, which modifies the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement. Amendments to the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement effected by the First Amendment include the addition of exceptions to the liens and asset sale covenants to permit the Loan Parties to enter into certain supply chain finance arrangements, as well as the addition of certain definitions related thereto.\nAt December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $230 million and $130 million, respectively, at an interest rate of 4.00% and4.25%, respectively. At December 26, 2015, the Secured Revolving Line of Credit also had $16 million related to outstanding Letters of Credit, and up to $87 million available for future borrowings. The Company reports its intra-period changes in its revolving credit balance on a net basis in its consolidated statement of cash flows as the Company intends the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 26, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement.\nThe agreements governing the 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable.\nCapital Lease Obligations\nThe Company terminated its capital lease obligations and entered into a non-cancelable operating lease agreement related to one of its facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada during 2015. As of December 26, 2015, the Company did not have any capital lease obligations outstanding.\nFuture Payments on Total Debt\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Companys future debt payment obligations were as follows:\nLong Term Debt (Principal only)\nShort Term Debt (Principal only)\n(In millions)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n2021 and thereafter\n-\nTotal\n$\n2,025\n$\nNOTE 11: Other Expense, Net\nThe following table summarizes the components of other income (expense), net:\n(In millions)\nNet loss on debt redemptions\n$\n-\n$\n(61\n)\n$\n(1\n)\nOther\n(5\n)\n(5\n)\nOther expense, net\n$\n(5\n)\n$\n(66\n)\n$\n-\nNOTE 12: Segment Reporting\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Companys Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenues and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net and income taxes. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on managements judgment. In connection with the Companys continued strategic transformation, effective July 1, 2014, the Company realigned its organizational structure. As a result of this organizational change, the Company has the following two reportable segments:\nthe Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors\nand chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) and professional graphics; and\nthe Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and\nembedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, engineering services\nand royalties.\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are amortizations of acquired intangible assets, employee stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other special charges, net, technology node transition charge, workforce rebalancing severance charges, goodwill impairment charge, significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and a net gain from licenses and settlement agreements regarding patent-related matters. The Company also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material.\nThe following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment and income (loss) before income taxes for 2015, 2014 and 2013.

The Company conducts product and system research and development activities for its products in the United States, with additional design and development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and Israel. The Companys assembly, test, mark and packaging facilities are located in Malaysia and China. The Companys material sales and marketing offices are located in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia.\nThe following table summarizes sales to external customers by country, which is based on the billing location of the customer:\n(In millions)\nUnited States\n$\n$\n1,030\n$\nEurope\nChina\n1,145\n2,324\n2,519\nSingapore\nJapan\n1,254\n1,324\nOther countries\nTotal sales to external customers\n$\n3,991\n$\n5,506\n$\n5,299\nThe Company had two customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated net revenue in 2015. The Company had three customers that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated net revenue in 2014 and 2013. Net sales to these customers were approximately 31% and 18% of consolidated net revenue in 2015, 23%, 13% and 13% of consolidated net revenue in 2014 and 17%, 11% and 10% of consolidated net revenue in 2013.

On April 29, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). As of December 26, 2015, the Company also has stock options outstanding under equity compensation plans that the Company assumed as part of its SeaMicro acquisition. Shares reserved for future grants under the Companys prior equity compensation plans were consolidated into the 2004 Plan; none of the reserved shares under the SeaMicro plan were consolidated into the 2004 Plan. As of December 26, 2015, the Company had 11.4 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 83 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units.\nUnder the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three- to four-year period from the date of grant and expire within ten years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards.\nUnder the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant fair market value awards or full value awards. Fair market value awards are awards granted at or above the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Full value awards are awards granted at less than the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Awards can consist of (i) stock options and stock appreciation rights granted at the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and (ii) restricted stock or restricted stock units, as full value awards. The following is a description of the material terms of the awards that may be granted under the 2004 Plan.\nStock Options. A stock option is the right to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a fixed exercise price for a fixed period of time. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise.\nStock Appreciation Rights. Awards of stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan. Stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees and consultants. No stock appreciation right may be granted at less than fair market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant or have a term of over ten years from the date of grant. Upon exercising a stock appreciation right, the holder of such right is entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying\n(i) the difference between the closing price of a share of the Companys common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. The Companys obligation arising upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid in shares or in cash, or any combination thereof.\nRestricted Stock. Restricted stock can be granted to any employee, director or consultant. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock is $0.00 per share.\nRestricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Companys common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $0.00 per share.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Companys senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market condition. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Companys financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.\nStock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs and PRSUs granted after April 29, 2015, generally may not vest in less than one year following the date of grant.\nValuation and Expense Information\nStock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows:\n(In millions)\nCost of sales\n$\n$\n$\nResearch and development\nMarketing, general, and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0\n$\n$\n$\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore the Company did not record any effects relating to financing cash flows. The Company did not capitalize stock-based compensation cost as part of the cost of an asset because the cost was immaterial.\nStock Options. The Company uses the lattice-binomial model in determining the fair value of the employee stock options.\nThe weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013 was $1.02, $1.46 and $1.52 per share, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nExpected volatility\n60.14\n%\n53.36\n%\n59.03\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.29\n%\n1.15\n%\n0.79\n%\nExpected dividends\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nExpected life (in years)\n3.91\n3.86\n3.83\nThe Company used a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Companys common stock as the expected volatility assumption required by the lattice-binomial model. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates commensurate with the term of the Companys employee stock options. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity, including market-based stock options, and related information:\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\n(In millions, except share price)\nStock options:\nOutstanding at beginning of year\n$\n4.78\n$\n5.08\n$\n5.51\nGranted\n$\n2.12\n$\n3.73\n$\n3.63\nCanceled\n(9\n)\n$\n4.91\n(4\n)\n$\n7.64\n(6\n)\n$\n7.73\nExercised\n(3\n)\n$\n1.61\n(3\n)\n$\n1.47\n(3\n)\n$\n1.56\nOutstanding at end of year\n$\n4.44\n$\n4.78\n$\n5.08\nExercisable at end of year\n$\n5.34\n$\n5.28\n$\n5.62\nAs of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding stock options was 3.38 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $6 million. As of December 26, 2015, the weighted-average remaining contractual life of exercisable stock options was 1.96 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $1 million. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $2 million, $7 million and $5 million, respectively.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company had $11 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to stock options that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 2.30 years.\nRestricted Stock and RSUs. Restricted stock and RSUs vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Compensation and Leadership Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and are based either on continued service or continued service and performance. The cost of restricted stock and RSUs is determined using the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant, and the compensation expense is recognized over the service period.\nThe summary of the changes in restricted stock and RSUs outstanding, including the PRSUs, during 2015, 2014 and 2013 is presented below:\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nFair Value\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nFair Value\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nFair Value\n(In millions except share price)\nUnvested balance at beginning of period\n$\n4.05\n$\n4.52\n$\n6.41\nGranted\n$\n2.03\n$\n3.89\n$\n3.81\nForfeited\n(15\n)\n$\n3.71\n(5\n)\n$\n4.48\n(3\n)\n$\n5.76\nVested\n(15\n)\n$\n4.13\n(15\n)\n$\n4.90\n(10\n)\n$\n6.93\nUnvested balance at end of period\n$\n2.61\n$\n4.05\n$\n4.52\nIncluded in the table above are approximately 0.3 million shares of restricted stock granted upon the acquisition of SeaMicro in 2012. The weighted-average estimated fair value of the restricted stock was $4.03.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock and RSUs vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $33 million, $60 million and $36 million, respectively. Compensation expense recognized for the restricted stock and RSUs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $57 million, $65 million and $68 million, respectively.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Company had $88 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock and RSUs that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.99 years.\nPRSUs. The Company estimated the fair value for the PRSUs with a market condition using Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant. During 2015, the Company granted 5.2 million PRSUs to certain of the Companys senior executives, of which 3.9 million PRSUs included a market condition. During 2014, the Company granted 5.2 million PRSUs to certain of the Companys certain senior executives, of which 4.1 million PRSUs included a market condition.\nThe summary of the changes in the PRSUs during 2015, 2014 and 2013 is presented below.\n(Shares in millions)\nUnvested shares at beginning of period\nGranted\nForfeited\n(7\n)\n(1\n)\n-\nVested\n-\n-\n-\nUnvested shares at end of period\nNOTE 14: Other Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a retirement savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, that allows participating employees in the United States to contribute up to 100% of their pre-tax salary subject to Internal Revenue Service limits. The Company matched 75% of employees contributions up to 6% of their compensation, to a maximum per employee match of $11,925, $11,700 and $11,475 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Companys contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $16 million, $18 million and $19 million, respectively.\nNOTE 15: Commitments and Guarantees\nOperating Leases\nAs of December 26, 2015, the Companys future non-cancelable operating lease commitments, including those for facilities vacated in connection with restructuring activities, were as follows:\nYear\nOperating\nleases\n(In millions)\n$\n2021 and thereafter\nTotal non-cancelable operating lease commitments\n$\nThe Company leases certain of its facilities, and in some jurisdictions, the Company leases the land on which these facilities are built, under non-cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. The Company also leases certain manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Rent expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $47 million, $59 million and $64 million, respectively.\nIn December 1998, the Company arranged for the sale of its marketing, general and administrative facility in Sunnyvale, California and leased it back for a period of 20 years. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $37 million on the sale and is amortizing it over the life of the lease. The lease expires in December 2018. At the beginning of the fourth lease year and every three years thereafter, the rent is adjusted by 200% of the cumulative increase in the consumer price index over the prior three-year period, up to a maximum of 6.9%.\nIn September 2013, the Company sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. The Company recorded a deferred gain of $14 million on the sale and is amortizing over the initial lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term, and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter.\nCertain other operating leases contain provisions for escalating lease payments subject to changes in the consumer price index. Total future lease obligations as of December 26, 2015 were $306 million.\nPurchase and Other Contractual Obligations\nThe Companys purchase obligations primarily include the Companys obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties. As of December 26, 2015, total non-cancelable purchase obligations, excluding the Companys wafer purchase commitments to GF under the WSA, were $319 million.\nThe Company also had other contractual obligations, included in Other long-term liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet, which consists of $40 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses that will be paid through 2018.\nFuture unconditional purchase obligations as of December 26, 2015 were as follows:\nYear\nUnconditional purchase obligations\n(In millions)\n$\n-\n2021 and thereafter\n-\nTotal unconditional purchase commitments\n$\nObligations to GF\nObligations to GF represent all of the Companys expected cash payments to GF based on wafer receipts and research and development activities. As of December 26, 2015, purchase obligations for fiscal 2016 were approximately $248 million, of which amount wafers and research and development activities of approximately $185 million were received by December 31, 2015.\nWarranties and Indemnities\nThe Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to the Companys approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for one year. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company also offers a three-year limited warranty to end users for only those CPU and AMD APU products that are commonly referred to as processors in a box and for certain server CPU products. The Company also offered extended limited warranties to certain customers of tray microprocessor products and/or professional graphics products who have written agreements with the Company and target their computer systems at the commercial and/or embedded markets.\nChanges in the Companys estimated liability for product warranty during the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014 are as follows:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 27,\n(In millions)\nBeginning balance\n$\n$\nNew warranties issued during the period\nSettlements during the period\n(26\n)\n(39\n)\nChanges in liability for pre-existing warranties during the period, including expirations\n(6\n)\nEnding balance\n$\n$\nIn addition to product warranties, the Company, from time to time in its normal course of business, indemnifies other parties, with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses, such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Companys products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material.\nNOTE 16: Contingencies\nSecurities Class Action\nOn January 15, 2014, a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al., C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 (the Hatamian Lawsuit) was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period April 4, 2011 through October 18, 2012. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual officers regarding its 32nm technology and Llano product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Companys common stock during the period. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys fees and costs. On July 7, 2014, the Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs claims. On March 31, 2015, the Court denied the motion to dismiss. On May 14, 2015, the Company filed its answer to plaintiffs corrected amended complaint. The discovery process is ongoing. On September 4, 2015, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. A court-ordered mediation held in January 2016 did not result in a settlement of the lawsuit.\nBased upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\nOn March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al., Case No. 1:14-cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of the Companys directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32nm technology and Llano product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Companys common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al., Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of the Companys directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-01890. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the shareholder vote on AMDs 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hatamian Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits are currently stayed.\nBased upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979.\nIn 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements.\nTo address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material.\nOther Legal Matters\nThe Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the managements current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNOTE 17: Restructuring and Other Special Charges, Net\n2015 Restructuring Plan\nIn the third quarter of 2015, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (2015 Restructuring Plan) focused on its ongoing efforts to simplify its business and better align resources around its priorities and business outlook. The 2015 Restructuring Plan involves a reduction of global headcount by approximately 5% and includes organizational actions such as outsourcing certain IT services and application development. During 2015, the Company recorded a $37 million restructuring charge, which consisted of approximately $27 million of severance and benefit costs, approximately $1 million of facilities related consolidation charges and approximately $9 million of intangible asset related charges associated with the impairment of certain software licenses that have ongoing payment obligations. The 2015 Restructuring Plan resulted in total cash payments of $14 million in 2015. The Company expects the 2015 Restructuring Plan will likely result in total cash payments of approximately $14 million in 2016. The Company expects actions associated with the 2015 Restructuring Plan to be substantially completed by the end the third quarter of 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\nSeverance\nand related\nbenefits\nOther exit\nrelated\ncosts\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBalance as of June 27, 2015\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nCharges (reversals), net\nCash payments\n(13\n)\n(1\n)\n(14\n)\nNon-cash charges\n-\n(9\n)\n(9\n)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n$\n-\n$\n2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company implemented a restructuring plan (2014 Restructuring Plan) designed to improve operating efficiencies. The 2014 Restructuring Plan involved a reduction of global headcount by approximately 6% and an alignment of its real estate footprint with its reduced headcount. The Company recorded a $57 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2014, which consisted of $44 million for severance and costs related to the continuation of certain employee benefits, $6 million for contract or program termination costs, $1 million for facilities related costs and $6 million for asset impairments, a non-cash charge. During 2015, the Company recorded a $16 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $5 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $2 million for severance and related benefits and $9 million for facilities related costs. The 2014 Restructuring Plan was substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of 2015.\nThe following table provides a summary of the restructuring activities during 2015 and the related liabilities recorded in Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of December 26, 2015:\nSeverance\nand related\nbenefits\nOther exit\nrelated\ncosts\nTotal\n(In millions)\nBalance as of December 27, 2014\n$\n$\n$\nCharges (reversals), net\nCash payments\n(23\n)\n(7\n)\n(30\n)\nNon-cash charges\n-\n(5\n)\n(5\n)\nBalance as of December 26, 2015\n$\n$\n$\n2012 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company implemented a restructuring plan designed to improve the Companys cost structure and to strengthen its competitiveness in core growth areas. The plan primarily involved a workforce reduction of approximately 14% as well as asset impairments and facility consolidations. The Company recorded restructuring expense in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately $90 million which was primarily comprised of employee severance. The non-cash portion of the restructuring expense included approximately $4 million of asset impairments. In 2014 and 2013, the Company incurred costs of $3 million and $11 million, respectively, related to facility consolidation and site closures, which were partially offset by the release of employee severance costs of $2 million and $5 million, respectively. The 2012 restructuring plan was substantially completed as of the end of the third quarter of 2013.\nDense Server Systems Business Exit\nAs a part of the Companys strategy to simplify and sharpen its investment focus, the Company exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro, in the first quarter of 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $76 million in Restructuring and other special charges, net on the Companys consolidated statements of operations during 2015. This charge consisted of an impairment charge of $62 million related to the acquired intangible assets. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets associated with its dense server systems business was fully impaired as the Company did not have plans to utilize the related freedom fabric technology in any of its future products nor did it have any plans at that time to monetize the associated intellectual property. In addition, the exit charge consisted of a $7 million non-cash charge related to asset impairments, $4 million of severance and related benefits and $3 million for contract or program termination costs. The Company expects to complete this exit activity by the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nExecutive Officer Separation\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company recorded other special charges of $13 million. The amount primarily included $10 million due to the departure of the Companys former CEO, of which $5 million was related to cash and $5 million was related to stock-based compensation expense. The amount is recorded under Restructuring and other special charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nSale and Leaseback Transactions\nIn September 2013, the Company sold a light industrial building in Singapore and leased back a portion of the original space. The Company received net proceeds of $46 million in connection with the sale, which resulted in a $17 million gain that the Company recorded in the third quarter of 2013 and a $14 million deferred gain as of September 28, 2013 that is being amortized over the initial operating lease term. The initial operating lease term expires in September 2023 and provides for options to extend the operating lease for 4 years at the end of the initial lease term, and for an additional 3.5 years thereafter.\nIn September 2013, the Company also sold an office building in Austin, Texas. The Company received net cash proceeds of $10 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $5 million gain in the third quarter of 2013.\nIn March 2013, the Company sold and leased back land and office buildings in Austin, Texas. The Company received net cash proceeds of $164 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $52 million charge in the first quarter of 2013. The operating lease expires in March 2025 and provides for one 10-year optional renewal.\nIn March 2013, the Company also sold an office building in Markham, Ontario, Canada, and leased back a portion of the original space through June 2013. The Company received net cash proceeds of $13 million in connection with the sale and recorded a $6 million gain in the first quarter of 2013.\nThe net charge of $24 million in 2013 related to the real estate transactions described above is recorded in the Restructuring and other special charges, net on the consolidated statements of operations.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (1). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 18, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 18, 2016\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\nWe have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015 based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 and schedule of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., and our report dated February 18, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nRedwood City, California\nFebruary 18, 2016\nSupplementary Financial Information (unaudited)\nThe Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

ITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs of December 26, 2015, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.\nManagement has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 26, 2015 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
