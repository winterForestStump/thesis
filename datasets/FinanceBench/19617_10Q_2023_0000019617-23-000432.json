Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.\nJPMorgan Chases acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated.\nOn May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the First Republic acquisition). There can be no assurance that the First Republic acquisition will have the anticipated positive results, including with respect to:\nthe total cost of integration\nthe time required to complete the integration\nthe amount of longer-term cost savings\nthe overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or\nan improved price for JPMorgan Chases common stock.\nIntegration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the First Republic acquisition and its integration efforts.\nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the First Republic acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chases ability to successfully conduct its business.\nSupervision and regulation\nRefer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 4-8 of JPMorgan Chases 2022 Form 10-K for information on Supervision and Regulation.
