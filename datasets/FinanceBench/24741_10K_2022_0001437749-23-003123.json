Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in rapidly changing economic, political and technological environments that present numerous risks. Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and the trading price of our common stock or debt. The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect the Company. This information should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (MD&A) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations\nCOVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may continue to impact our workforce, operations and supply chains, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness or similar global health crisis. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures.\nInflationary price pressures and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, among other factors, could negatively impact our profitability\nIncreases in the price of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, components and parts, along with logistics and other related costs, may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products, parts and components. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner to meet our supply needs and/or could lead to increased costs. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products and could negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Increasing our prices to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products, and thereby also negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy.\nFactors such as supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory; if we are unable to obtain the necessary equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources, utilities and other essentials required in our products or processes, our business will be negatively impacted\nCornings business relies on the timely supply of materials, equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials, equipment and services, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant or sudden increases in demand for such materials, equipment and services, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of materials, equipment and services needed to manufacture Cornings products. Such shortages have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers ability to meet our demand requirements and Cornings manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key materials, equipment and services are subject to long lead-times or are available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Corning and for companies throughout our supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.\n\u202f\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources or utilities, equipment, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCorning may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:\nThe failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of materials, equipment and services on a cost-effective basis;\nVolatility in the availability and cost of materials, equipment and services, including rising prices due to inflation or scarcity of availability;\nDifficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\nShipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;\nA worldwide shortage of semiconductor components or other issues;\nInformation technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and\nNatural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Cornings control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations.\nCornings Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Companys profits and cash flow; any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results\nCornings ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to factors such as industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies. If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and/or increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nBecause we have a concentrated customer base, future sales and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the actions or loss of one or more key customers\nA relatively small number of end customers account for a high percentage of our net sales. This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:\nThe loss or insolvency of one or more of our key customers, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows;\nCustomers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions; and\nMergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of the customer base.\nThe following table details the number of combined customers of our reportable segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:\nNumber of combined end customers\n% of total segment net sales in 2022\nOptical Communications\n26%\nDisplay Technologies\n37%\nSpecialty Materials\n49%\nEnvironmental Technologies\n74%\nLife Sciences\n37%\nEvents outside of Cornings control, or those of our contract manufacturers, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to serve our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Cornings net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity\nDisruption to our manufacturing operations, or those of our contract manufacturers, could significantly impact Cornings ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual business units and the Company. Given the geographical concentration of certain of the Companys and our contract manufacturers plants in Asia Pacific, the highly engineered nature of the facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. Due to the specialized nature of our products and single-site manufacturing locations, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities.\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nThe intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or entities that acquire intellectual property, including patents, for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.\n\u202f\nInformation technology dependency and cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, competitive or reputational harm, and result in material adverse effects on our operations and financial results\nThe Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure (IT systems) owned and operated by the Company or managed by third-party service providers, suppliers and contract manufacturers. IT systems enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, operations, systems, data and other assets. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our providers collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information. Intrusion into a supplier or contract manufacturer system not integrated with a Corning IT system could result in service disruption and/or loss of financial control.\nOur IT systems, and those of our providers, may be vulnerable to compromise or disruption due to human error or malfeasance, outdated applications, computer viruses or malware (e.g., ransomware), natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents and disruptions. Increased work-from-home, at both the Company and our providers, presents additional operational risk. Companies that provide utilities, water, transportation, natural gas and other resources and services across our supply chain, are critical to our manufacturing operations and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. From time to time, both we and certain of our providers, have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents. We may be unable to anticipate, detect, prevent or remediate future attacks, particularly as attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence.\nAny significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption, data breach, or compromise to the accessibility, security or integrity of our or our providers IT systems, or the misappropriation or disclosure of any confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, could result in the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment or systems damage, downtime, safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including by harming our competitive position and reputation, disrupting our manufacturing, reducing the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impairing our ability to access suppliers, contract manufacturers, customers and cloud-based services, subjecting us to litigation or regulatory investigations or fines, increasing the costs of compliance and remediation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\u202f We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our IT systems, information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any, or all, of our applicable insurance policies.\nWe may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments\nDeveloping our products through our innovation model of research and development is costly and often involves a long investment cycle. We make significant investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return. If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, or if our products or technologies become obsolete, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins for both near- and long-term.\nOur innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized expertise\nOur innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities. The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations\nSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, wastewater, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and wastewater at our facilities. We have taken steps to control and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.\nAny failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and the many other countries in which we operate, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of climate change, CO2 abatement and emission reduction targets, may affect our businesses and results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production or sales of our products or those of our customers.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may have additional tax liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.\u202f There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.\u202f Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.\u202f Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax, assessments, audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, or result in the forfeiture of funds deposited with the relevant government authorities.\u202f The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which such a determination is made.\nThe U.S., other countries and international organizations, such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, may change their laws or issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.\nAs a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results\nWe are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support and shared administrative service centers. Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products.\nCompliance with laws and regulations increases our costs. We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our businesses and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.\nCorning is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain, recessionary and inflationary global economy\nUncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, availability of government incentives, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Cornings operating results. Markets for our products depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for network capacity, electronics and automotive products. Uncertain or adverse economic and recessionary business conditions, among other factors, that could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand, or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results.\nSimilarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products or the products in which our products are used. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our demand requirements.\nUncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Corning to forecast its operating results, make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Corning does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Corning must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:\nThe economic and political conditions in each country or region and relationships among countries;\nComplex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;\nGovernmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Cornings profitability and assets;\nTariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping and countervailing duties;\nGeographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;\nPeriodic health epidemic or pandemic concerns, such as COVID-19;\nPolitical unrest, geopolitical tensions, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;\nDifficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data and information technology systems;\nDiffering legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;\nComplex, changing or competing tax regimes;\nDifficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;\nNatural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and\nPotential loss of utilities or other disruptions affecting manufacturing.\nWe have significant exposure to foreign currency movements\nA large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure. Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly.\nThe ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\nThese factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of over-the-counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCurrent or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations\nAs a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigations and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties\nOur products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel. If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject to, based on the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtain an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\nMoreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the U.S., and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.\nInternational trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, together with anti-dumping claims, duties, slowed regulatory approvals and other restrictions, in countries in which we import raw materials and components or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a countrys adoption of nationalistic policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Further, these actions in conjunction with any trade tensions may restrict us from participating in a specific market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nWe operate 124 manufacturing plants and processing facilities in 15 countries, of which approximately 32% are in the U.S. We own approximately 53% of our executive and corporate buildings, with 93% located in and around Corning, New York. We also own approximately 64% of our sales and administrative office square footage, 81% of our research and development square footage, 66% of our manufacturing square footage and 7% of our warehousing square footage.\nManufacturing, sales and administrative, research and development facilities and warehouse facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 65.8 million square feet.

Information concerning lease commitments is included in Note 6 (Leases) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nCorning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.\nEnvironmental Litigation\nCorning has been designated by federal or state governments under environmental laws, including Superfund, as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with 19 hazardous waste sites. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to such hazardous waste sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had accrued approximately $109 million and $55 million, respectively, for the estimated undiscounted liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Companys liability. Item 4.

Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) was prepared to provide a historical and prospective narrative on our financial condition and results of operations through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. The discussion and analysis of the 2021 to 2020 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOur MD&A is organized as follows:\nOverview\nResults of Operations\nSegment Analysis\nCore Performance Measures\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEnvironment\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNew Accounting Standards\nForward-Looking Statements\nOVERVIEW\nWe introduced our 2020-to-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework with a focus on capturing opportunities to sell more Corning content through each of our Market-Access Platforms. Our goals included core sales growth at a compound annual growth rate of 6 to 8 percent. From 2019, when we first introduced the new framework, through 2022, we grew core sales at a greater than 8 percent CAGR, even in the face of ongoing external challenges. Over the past four years, we advanced significant strategic initiatives, including fiber-to-the-home and data center solutions in Optical Communications, delivering on our gasoline particulate filter content opportunity in Environmental Technologies, introducing Ceramic Shield with Apple in Specialty Materials and ramping our Gen 10.5 plants to extend our leadership in Display Technologies. In addition, we made major progress on our emerging innovations; we gained significant traction in our Automotive Glass Solutions business; and our pharmaceutical packaging portfolio played a central role in combatting the global pandemic and supported the delivery of more than 8 billion COVID-19 doses. These achievements have helped extend our leadership positions across our markets and pave the way for future growth.\nSince 2020, the external environment has been characterized by the impact of the pandemic and its resulting effects including supply chain disruptions, depressed productivity, large swings in consumer spending and inflation. Our 2022 results are a prime example of our resilience in this complex operating environment. Building off a strong 2021, we outperformed our consumer-facing end markets, we captured growth in the solar market and we delivered record sales of $5 billion dollars in Optical Communications.\nHowever, our profitability and cash flow have lagged sales growth as a number of pandemic-driven effects continue to ripple across the global economy. Our core priorities throughout this period were protecting our people and delivering for our customers, and as a result, we operated with elevated staffing and higher-than-normal inventory levels during this period. In addition, persistent inflation added to the cost of raw materials we purchased, the cost to produce and ship our products and the inventory we maintained.\nIn response, we took a series of actions to improve profitability and cash generation throughout 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we took multiple additional actions, including raising prices across our businesses to more appropriately share inflationary costs with our customers; adjusting our productivity ratios closer to historical metrics without impacting our ability to supply and capture future growth; and normalizing inventory levels.\nOverall, we will continue to focus on operating each of our businesses well and adjusting to meet the needs of the moment while simultaneously advancing growth initiatives and capabilities that will drive continued success as the global economy stabilizes. Our focused and cohesive portfolio provides strategic resilience that is evident in our results, even in the current environment. We remain confident in our ability to deliver durable multiyear growth with improved margins and cash generation.\n2022 Results\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $14.2 billion, a net increase of $107 million, or 1%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This is driven by 15% growth in segment net sales in Optical Communications of $674 million and 34% growth in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million, which helped offset a $394 million decrease in Display Technologies. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted Cornings consolidated net sales by $616 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,316 million, or $1.54 per diluted share, compared to net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of $1,906 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. When compared to 2021, the $590 million decrease was primarily driven by a $238 million increase in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges, a $50 million increase in litigation, regulatory and other legal matters and a $120 million adverse impact from foreign currency translation.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $0.26 per diluted share, or 20%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by the immediate repurchase and retirement of 35 million common shares which resulted in an $803 million one-time reduction to net income available to common shareholders in 2021, partially offset by the decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated as described above. Refer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) and Note 17 (Earnings per Common Share) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n2023 Corporate Outlook\nFor the first quarter 2023, we anticipate core sales in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n% change\n22 vs. 21\nNet sales\n$ 14,189\n$ 14,082\n%\nGross margin\n$ 4,506\n$ 5,063\n(11 %)\n(gross margin %)\n%\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$ 1,898\n$ 1,827\n%\n(as a % of net sales)\n%\n%\nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n$ 1,047\n$\n%\n(as a % of net sales)\n%\n%\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\n$\n$\n(1 %)\n(as a % of net sales)\n%\n%\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 1,797\n$ 2,426\n(26 %)\n(as a % of net sales)\n%\n%\nProvision for income taxes\n$ (411 )\n$ (491 )\n%\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,906\n(31 %)\n(as a % of net sales)\n%\n%\nComprehensive income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n$\n$ 1,471\n(55 %)\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $107 million, or 1%, when compared to the same period in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by sales growth in Optical Communications of $674 million and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses of $419 million, offset by the adverse impact of volume declines in Display Technologies resulting in a decrease in segment net sales of $394 million. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted Cornings consolidated net sales by $616 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021. Refer to the Segment Analysis section of our MD&A below for a discussion of net sales by segment.\nIn 2022 and 2021, sales in international markets accounted for 65% and 68% of total net sales, respectively.\nCost of Sales / Gross Margin\nThe types of expenses included in cost of sales are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; freight and logistics costs; and other production overhead.\nGross margin decreased by $557 million, or 11% and gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased by 4 percentage points when compared to 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by higher production, material and freight costs as well as incremental severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges of $257 million. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates had an adverse impact of $422 million on Cornings consolidated gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $71 million, or 4%, and were consistent as a percentage of sales when compared to 2021.\nThe types of expenses included in selling, general and administrative expenses are: salaries, wages and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development and engineering expenses increased by $52 million, or 5%, and were consistent as a percentage of sales when compared to 2021.\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net\nIncluded in translated earnings contract gain, net, is the impact of foreign currency contracts which economically hedge the translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and British pound and its impact on net income.\nThe following table provides detailed information on the impact of translated earnings contracts gain, net for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nIncome\nbefore tax\nNet income\nIncome\nbefore tax\nNet income\nIncome\nbefore tax\nNet income\n2022 vs. 2021\nHedges related to translated earnings:\nRealized gain, net (1)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nUnrealized gain, net (2)\n(276 )\n(213 )\nTotal translated earnings contract gain, net\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$ (3 )\n$ (4 )\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, includes pre-tax realized gains of $20 million and pre-tax realized losses of $20 million, respectively, related to the expiration of option contracts. These amounts were reflected within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(2)\nThe impact to income was primarily driven by Japanese yen, South Korean won and euro-denominated hedges of translated earnings.\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nThe translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current year, adversely impacted Cornings income before income taxes by $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\nA net provision of $67 million due to changes in tax reserves;\nA net provision of $40 million due to differences arising from foreign earnings; and\nA net provision of $38 million due to changes in valuation allowance assessments, offset by\nA net benefit of $60 million due to tax credits; and\nA net benefit of $49 million due to foreign derived intangible income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\nA net benefit of $62 million due to tax credits; and\nA net benefit of $37 million related to share-based compensation payments, offset by\nA net provision of $52 million due to differences arising from foreign earnings, including the impact of intercompany asset sales.\nThe U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) in August 2022, which, among other sections, creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. This provision of the IRA will first apply to the Company in 2024. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are currently evaluating the various credits available under IRA and its impact to Cornings financial position and results of operations, including the effective tax rate.\nRefer to Note 7 (Income Taxes) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.\nNet Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated\nAs a result of the items discussed above, net income attributable to Corning Incorporated and per share data were as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,906\nSeries A convertible preferred stock dividend\n(24 )\nExcess consideration paid for redemption of preferred stock (1)\n(803 )\nNet income available to common shareholders used in basic and diluted earnings per common share calculation\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,079\nBasic earnings per common share\n$ 1.56\n$ 1.30\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$ 1.54\n$ 1.28\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted\n(1)\nOn January 16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million Common Shares, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder, Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). On April 5, 2021, Corning and SDC executed a Share Repurchase Agreement (SRA). Refer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nComprehensive Income attributable to Corning Incorporated\nThe $810 million decrease in comprehensive income attributable to Corning Incorporated was primarily due to the $549 million decrease in net income attributable to Corning Incorporated and a $175 million increase in net losses on foreign currency translation adjustments, driven by the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and South Korean won.\nRefer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nSEGMENT ANALYSIS\nFinancial results for the reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of financial information to assist the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in making internal operating decisions, which is more fully discussed within Note 19 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and includes a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our consolidated statements of income.\nSegment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.\nThe following table presents segment net sales by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n$ change\n% change\n22 vs. 21\n22 vs. 21\nOptical Communications\n$ 5,023\n$ 4,349\n$\n%\nDisplay Technologies\n3,306\n3,700\n(394 )\n(11 )%\nSpecialty Materials\n2,002\n2,008\n(6 )\n%\nEnvironmental Technologies\n1,584\n1,586\n(2 )\n%\nLife Sciences\n1,228\n1,234\n(6 )\n%\nNet sales of reportable segments\n13,143\n12,877\n%\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\n1,662\n1,243\n%\nNet sales of reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (1)\n$ 14,805\n$ 14,120\n$\n%\n(1) Refer to Note 19 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net sales.\nOptical Communications\nThe increase in segment net sales was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of carrier and enterprise products for 5G, broadband and the cloud.\nDisplay Technologies\nThe decrease in segment net sales was due to lower volumes, primarily attributable to decreased panel maker utilization, while price remained consistent with the prior year.\nSpecialty Materials\nSegment net sales remained relatively flat compared to prior year. Demand for advanced optics products grew, including next generation semiconductor equipment materials, and demand for premium glasses remained strong, helping offset lower demand in the smartphone, tablet and notebook markets.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nSegment net sales remained flat compared to prior year, due to constrained production as automotive producers experienced prolonged component shortages for semiconductor chips, as well as negative impacts from COVID-related shutdowns in China.\nLife Sciences\nSegment net sales remained relatively flat compared to prior year, primarily due to lower demand for COVID-related products, offset by growth in pharmaceutical research and bioproduction products.\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\nThe increase was primarily driven by HSG, as demand for semiconductor and solar-grade polysilicon remain strong in addition to higher solar prices as compared to the prior year. The increase is also attributable to year-over-year growth from Pharmaceutical Technologies and Auto Glass Solutions.\nThe following table presents segment net income (loss) by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n$ change\n% change\n22 vs. 21\n22 vs. 21\nOptical Communications\n$\n$\n$\n%\nDisplay Technologies\n(191 )\n(20 )%\nSpecialty Materials\n(31 )\n(8 )%\nEnvironmental Technologies\n%\nLife Sciences\n(41 )\n(21 )%\nNet income of reportable segments\n2,215\n2,347\n(132 )\n(6 )%\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\n(51 )\n*\nNet income of reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (1)\n$ 2,254\n$ 2,296\n$ (42 )\n(2 )%\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Refer to Note 19 (Reportable Segments) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation to consolidated net income.\nOptical Communications\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily driven by the increases in sales, outlined above, partially offset by higher inflationary costs and manufacturing costs.\nDisplay Technologies\nThe decrease in segment net income was primarily driven by the lower glass volume, impacting sales, as outlined above.\nSpecialty Materials\nThe decrease in segment net income was primarily driven by the relatively flat level of sales, as outlined above, and impacted by continued development spending related to next-generation products.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nThe increase in segment net income was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies.\nLife Sciences\nThe decrease in segment net income was primarily driven by the relatively flat level of sales, as outlined above, and impacted by inflationary costs and higher manufacturing costs that were not completely offset by pricing actions.\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses\nThe increase was primarily driven by HSG due to higher solar prices.\nCORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nIn managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at our core performance measures. These items include the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt, the impact of the translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing operating results of the Company.\nIn addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro, as applicable to the segment. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. We establish constant-currency rates based on internally derived management estimates, which are closely aligned with the currencies we have hedged. For details of the rates used, please see the footnotes to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures section.\nWe believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. Further, we believe it reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.\nCore performance measures are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), but management believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions. We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures. With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management's control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nThe following table presents selected highlights from our operations, excluding certain items, (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n% change\n22 vs. 21\nCore net sales\n$ 14,805\n$ 14,120\n%\nCore net income\n$ 1,794\n$ 1,811\n(1 )%\nCore Net Sales\nCore net sales are consistent with net sales by reportable segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Segment and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses net sales and variances are discussed in detail in the Segment Analysis section of our MD&A.\nCore Net Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated core net income of $1.8 billion, or $2.09 per share, compared to core net income generated for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $1.8 billion, or $2.07 per share. The decrease in core net income of $17 million was driven by lower reportable segment net income of $132 million, as discussed in the Segment Analysis section of our MD&A, offset by an increase in $90 million in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses, primarily driven by HSG.\nCore Earnings per Common Share\nCore earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $2.09 per share, as result of a decrease in the weighted-average common shares outstanding offset by lower core net income.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of core basic and core diluted earnings per common share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\nCore net income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n$ 1,794\n$ 1,811\nLess: Series A convertible preferred stock dividend\nCore net income available to common shareholders - basic\n1,794\n1,787\nPlus: Series A convertible preferred stock dividend\nCore net income available to common shareholders - diluted\n$ 1,794\n$ 1,811\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and other dilutive securities\nSeries A convertible preferred stock\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted\nCore basic earnings per common share\n$ 2.13\n$ 2.16\nCore diluted earnings per common share\n$ 2.09\n$ 2.07\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES\nWe utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a companys financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows.\nCore net sales, core net income and the related per share numbers are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in our operations.\nSee Items Excluded from GAAP Measures for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\nThe following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (amounts in millions except percentages and per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nNet income\nIncome\nattributable\nEffective\nNet\nbefore\nto Corning\ntax\nPer\nsales\nincome taxes\nIncorporated\nrate (a)(b)\nshare\nAs reported - GAAP\n$ 14,189\n$ 1,797\n$ 1,316\n22.9 %\n$ 1.54\nConstant-currency adjustment (1)\n0.43\nTranslation gain on Japanese yen-denominated debt (2)\n(191 )\n(146 )\n(0.17 )\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net (3)\n(348 )\n(267 )\n(0.31 )\nAcquisition-related costs (4)\n0.13\nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments (5)\n0.10\nRestructuring, impairment and other charges and credits (6)\n0.37\nLitigation, regulatory and other legal matters (7)\n0.09\nPension mark-to-market adjustment (8)\n0.01\nGain on investments (9)\n(8 )\n(8 )\n(0.01 )\nGain on sale of business (10)\n(53 )\n(41 )\n(0.05 )\nContingent consideration (11)\n(32 )\n(25 )\n(0.03 )\nCore performance measures\n$ 14,805\n$ 2,310\n$ 1,794\n19.3 %\n$ 2.09\n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\n(b) The calculation of the effective tax rate excludes net income attributable to non-controlling interest of $70 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nNet income\nIncome\nattributable\nEffective\nNet\nbefore\nto Corning\ntax\nPer\nsales\nincome taxes\nIncorporated\nrate (a)(b)\nshare\nAs reported - GAAP\n$ 14,082\n$ 2,426\n$ 1,906\n20.2 %\n$ 1.28\nPreferred stock redemption (c)\n0.90\nSubtotal\n14,082\n2,426\n1,906\n20.2 %\n2.18\nConstant-currency adjustment (1)\n0.09\nTranslation gain on Japanese yen-denominated debt (2)\n(180 )\n(138 )\n(0.16 )\nTranslated earnings contract gain, net (3)\n(354 )\n(273 )\n(0.32 )\nAcquisition-related costs (4)\n0.15\nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments (5)\n(24 )\n(0.03 )\nRestructuring, impairment and other charges and credits (6)\n0.09\nLitigation, regulatory and other legal matters (7)\n0.03\nPension mark-to-market adjustment (8)\n0.03\nLoss on investments (9)\n0.02\nGain on sale of business (10)\n(54 )\n(46 )\n(0.05 )\nPreferred stock conversion (12)\n0.02\nBond redemption loss (13)\n0.03\nCore performance measures\n$ 14,120\n$ 2,313\n$ 1,811\n20.4 %\n$ 2.07\n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\n(b) The calculation of the effective tax rate excludes net income attributable to non-controlling interest of $29 million.\n(c) On January 16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million Common Shares, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder, Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). On April 5, 2021, Corning and SDC executed a Share Repurchase Agreement (SRA). Refer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nSee Items Excluded from GAAP Measures for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\nItems Excluded from GAAP Measures\nItems we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:\n(1)\nConstant-currency adjustment: As a significant portion of revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. The Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar and Euro, as applicable to the segment.\nConstant-currency rates are as follows and are applied to all periods presented:\nCurrency\nJapanese yen\nKorean won\nChinese yuan\nNew Taiwan dollar\nEuro\nRate\n\u00a5107\n\u20a91,175\n\u00a56.7\nNT$31\n\u20ac.81\n(2)\nTranslation of Japanese yen-denominated debt: Amount reflects the gain or loss on the translation of our yen-denominated debt to U.S. dollars.\n(3)\nTranslated earnings contract: Amount reflects the impact of the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro and new Taiwan dollar-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings, as well as the unrealized gains and losses of our British pound-denominated foreign currency hedges related to translated earnings.\n(4)\nAcquisition-related costs: Amount reflects intangible amortization, inventory valuation adjustments and external acquisition-related deal costs, as well as other transaction related costs.\n(5)\nDiscrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments: Amount reflects certain discrete period tax items such as changes in tax law, the impact of tax audits, changes in tax reserves and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances, as well as other tax-related adjustments.\n(6) Restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits: Amount reflects certain restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits, as well as other expenses, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs, which are not related to ongoing operations. The activity during 2022 primarily relates to capacity optimization for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials and an emerging growth business and severance charges across all segments. The activity in 2021 primarily relates to asset write-offs and charges for facility repairs resulting from the impact of power outages; the Company is pursuing recoveries under its applicable property insurance policies.\n(7) Litigation, regulatory and other legal matters: Amount reflects developments in commercial litigation, intellectual property disputes, adjustments to our estimated liability for environmental-related items and other legal matters.\n(8)\nPension mark-to-market adjustment: Amount primarily reflects defined benefit pension mark-to-market gains and losses, which arise from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets and discount rates.\n(9) Gain (loss) on investments: Amount reflects the gain or loss recognized on investment due to mark-to-mark adjustments for the change in fair value or the disposition of the investment.\n(10) Gain on sale of business: Amount reflects the gain recognized for the sale of a business.\n(11) Contingent consideration: Amount reflects the fair value mark-to-market cost adjustment of contingent consideration resulting from the HSG transaction on September 9, 2020.\n(12) Preferred stock conversion: Amount reflects the put option from the Share Repurchase Agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd.\n(13) Bond redemption loss: Amount reflects premiums on redemption of debentures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur financial condition and liquidity are strong. We are not aware of any known trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix of such resources.\nOur major source of funding for 2023 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs through 2023. We will continue to generate cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as discussed in more detail below.\nKey Balance Sheet Data\nWe fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, when necessary. In addition, we receive upfront cash from customers relating to long-term supply agreements, as well as cash incentives from government entities generally for capital expansion and related expenses.\nThe following table presents balance sheet and working capital measures (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nWorking capital\n$ 2,278\n$ 2,853\nCurrent ratio\n1.4:1\n1.6:1\nTrade accounts receivable, net of doubtful accounts\n$ 1,721\n$ 2,004\nDays sales outstanding\nInventories\n$ 2,904\n$ 2,481\nInventory turns\n3.4\n3.7\nDays payable outstanding (1)\nLong-term debt\n$ 6,687\n$ 6,989\nTotal debt\n$ 6,911\n$ 7,044\nTotal debt to total capital\n%\n%\n(1)\nIncludes trade payables only.\nWe perform comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer credit issues. We are not aware of any customer credit issues that could have a material impact on our liquidity.\nWe participate in accounts receivable management programs, including factoring arrangements to sell certain accounts receivable to third-party financial institutions or accelerate collections through our customer's supply chain financing arrangements. Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. By utilizing these types of programs, we have accelerated the collection of $1.6 billion and $0.6 billion of accounts receivable cumulatively throughout the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, we believe $1.2 billion and $0.4 billion would have been collected during the normal course of business within 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flow data (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 2,615\n$ 3,412\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$ (1,355 )\n$ (1,419 )\nNet cash used in financing activities\n$ (1,649 )\n$ (2,452 )\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $797 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the decrease in net income.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in realized gains on translated earnings contracts of $233 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased by $803 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower repayments of short-term borrowings and long-term debt of $773 million.\nSources of Liquidity\nWe generate strong ongoing cash flows from operations, which is our principal source of liquidity. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities were $2.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our cash and cash equivalents and available credit capacity included (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 1,671\nAvailable credit capacity:\nU.S. dollar revolving credit facility\n$ 1,500\nJapanese yen liquidity facility\n$\nChinese yuan facilities\n$\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe ended 2022 with $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 56% of the consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we distributed approximately $534 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies. As of December 31, 2022, Corning has approximately $1.3 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes. We do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings for which we asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested.\nDebt Facilities and Other Sources of Liquidity\nWe have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, we may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have outstanding commercial paper.\nOur $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, if needed. During 2022, we amended and restated our existing Revolving Credit Agreement, primarily to extend the term to 2027. Additionally, we amended and restated our 25 billion Japanese yen liquidity facility, equivalent to approximately $191 million, primarily to extend the term to 2025. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding amounts under either of these facilities.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. As of December 31, 2022, our leverage using this measure was approximately 36%. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance.\nOur debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such provisions.\nWe have access to certain unsecured variable rate loan facilities, with an aggregate capacity of 4,645 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to approximately $673 million, whose proceeds are used for capital investment and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, these facilities had variable rates ranging from 3.3% to 4.3% and maturities ranging from 2023 to 2032. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, borrowings totaled $352 million and $277 million, respectively.\nAs a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the SEC on December 4, 2020. Under this shelf registration we may offer, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement in the fourth quarter of 2023, prior to the expiration of the shelf registration statement currently in effect.\nCustomer Deposits, Deferred Revenue and Government Incentives\nWe receive cash deposits or consideration, generally non-refundable, from customers under long-term supply agreements. In addition, we receive cash incentives from government entities primarily to offset capital expenditures or related expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the amount received from these types of arrangements was $420 million.\nRefer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 4 (Revenue) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nUses of Cash\nFixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A\nWe had 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock) as of December 31, 2020. On January 16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million common shares. On April 5, 2021 we executed the Share Repurchase Agreement (SRA) with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC) and the Preferred Stock was fully converted as of April 8, 2021. Immediately following the conversion, we repurchased and retired 35 million of the common shares held by SDC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion, of which approximately $507 million was paid on both April 8, 2022 and 2021. The remaining payment of approximately $507 million will be paid on April 8, 2023.\nRefer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nStock Repurchases\nIn 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2018 repurchase plan (2019 Authorization).\nIn addition to the common shares repurchased under the SRA, as discussed above, we repurchased 6.0 million and 7.3 million shares of common stock under our 2019 Authorization for approximately $221 million and $274 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $3.3 billion remains available under our 2019 Authorization, which does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total dividends paid to common shareholders were $932 million, $871 million and $787 million, respectively. The Boards decision to declare and pay future dividends will depend on our income and liquidity position, among other factors. We expect to declare quarterly dividends and fund payments with cash from operations.\nOn February 8, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2023. The dividend will be payable on March 30, 2023.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We continue to invest in capacity expansions and new product lines across our businesses. We expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be consistent with 2022.\nCurrent Maturities of Short and Long-Term Debt\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $224 million of short-term borrowings that mature in less than one year. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows, with approximately $1.1 billion due over the next five years.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nOur global pension plans, including our unfunded and non-qualified plans, were 82% funded as of December 31, 2022. Our largest single pension plan is our U.S. qualified plan, which accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation, was 93% funded as of December 31, 2022.\nThe funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon multiple factors including actuarial assumptions, interest rates at year-end, prior investment returns and contributions made to the plans. In 2022, Corning made no voluntary contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and cash contributions to our international pension plans were not material. During 2023, the Company anticipates making cash contributions of $49 million to the international pension plans.\nRefer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nA summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2022 are detailed within Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nTranslated Earnings Contracts\nWe have entered into option and average rate forward contracts to economically hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen and its impact on our net income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $415 million and $363 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments. Included in these amounts are realized gains of $360 million and $27 million, respectively. These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $4.7 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.\nWe have entered into average rate forward contracts to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the South Korean won and its impact on our net income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $76 million and $33 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments. Included in these amounts are realized losses of $59 million and gains of $11 million, respectively. These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $2.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee and indemnity contracts. At the time a guarantee is issued, we are required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by us are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds. These guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.\nRefer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nENVIRONMENT\nRefer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings or Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered by management to be the most critical to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nValuation of the Previously Held Equity Interest from the Consolidation of HSG\nWe account for the change in controlling interest using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded. Assets would include intangible assets such as developed technologies and know-how, tradenames and customer-related intangibles, fixed assets and inventories. Liabilities would include contract liabilities such as customer deposits and deferred revenue, debt and other liabilities. These assets and liabilities recorded are assessed at the time of the change in control and require judgment in ascertaining the fair values. Any resulting gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. Additional information related to the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of the assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business combination. Changes in assumptions and estimates after completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results, could result in impacts our financial results.\nIn September 2020, HSG redeemed DuPonts entire ownership interest in HSG for $250 million (the Redemption). Upon completion of the Redemption, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $498 million on its previously held equity investment in HSG as a result of the consolidation resulting from the Redemption. The gain was calculated based on the difference between fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the Redemption. Independent appraisals assisted management in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. Such appraisals are based on acceptable valuation models as well as inputs and assumptions provided by management. The fair value of our equity interest in HSG was estimated by applying the income approach, which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate. We used a discount rate of 16.5% and terminal growth rate of zero.\nImpairment of assets held for use\nWe are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We perform this review each quarter and exercises judgment in assessing whether impairment indicators are present.\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. The physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on actual units lost. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all our precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\nA significant change in the use of a long-lived asset or its physical condition;\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\nAn accumulation of costs significantly more than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nFor purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Our assessment is performed at the operating segment level. For most of our operating segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nFor long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.\nFor an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows, including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if applicable. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. We believe our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs relating to a business within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, we discontinued our investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $217 million, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nRefer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIncome taxes\nWe are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue an opposing position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position. As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.\nFair value measures\nAs required, we use two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on our own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets. Our major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.\nDerivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound. Changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. For contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings within translated earnings contract gain (loss), net in the consolidated statements of income. In arriving at the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material.\nRefer to Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProbability of litigation outcomes\nWe are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law and other case-specific issues. Refer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings or Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Cornings material litigation matters.\nPension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)\nWe offer employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect our assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates. The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.\nCosts for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements: 1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year. These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets. Any interim remeasurement, such as curtailments, settlements, significant plan changes, or adjustments to the annual valuation, is recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such an event occurs.\nCosts for OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.\nThe following table presents our actual and expected (loss) return on assets, as well as the corresponding percentages (in millions, except percentages):\nDecember 31,\nActual (loss) return on plan assets - Domestic plans\n$ (728 )\n$\n$\nExpected return on plan assets - Domestic plans\nActual (loss) return on plan assets - International plans\n(139 )\n(2 )\nExpected return on plan assets - International plans\nWeighted-average actual and expected return on assets:\nActual (loss) return on plan assets - Domestic plans\n(20.05 )%\n6.17 %\n13.90 %\nExpected return on plan assets - Domestic plans\n6.00 %\n6.00 %\n6.00 %\nActual (loss) return on plan assets - International plans\n(26.26 )%\n(0.33 )%\n10.00 %\nExpected return on plan assets - International plans\n1.64 %\n1.26 %\n1.71 %\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $3.2 billion.\nThe following table presents the estimated increases (decreases) in future ongoing pension expense and projected benefit obligation assuming a 25 basis point change in the key assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):\nChange in ongoing pension expense\nChange in projected benefit obligation\n25 basis point decrease in each spot rate\n$ (1 )\n$\n25 basis point increase in each spot rate\n$\n$ (71 )\n25 basis point decrease in expected return on assets\n$\n25 basis point increase in expected return on assets\n$ (7 )\nThe above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.

Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, the Companys future operating performance, the Companys share of new and existing markets, the Companys revenue and earnings growth rates, the Companys ability to innovate and commercialize new products, the Companys expected capital expenditure and the Companys implementation of cost-reduction initiatives and measures to improve pricing, including the optimization of the Companys manufacturing capacity.\nAlthough the Company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, current estimates and forecasts, general economic conditions, its knowledge of its business and key performance indicators that impact the Company, actual results could differ materially. Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n- global economic trends, competition and geopolitical risks, or an escalation of sanctions, tariffs or other trade tensions between the U.S. and China or other countries, and related impacts on our businesses global supply chains and strategies;\n- changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and market volatility, including developments and volatility arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, interest rates, the value of securities and other financial assets, precious metals, oil, natural gas and other commodity prices and exchange rates (particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and South Korean won), the availability of government incentives, decreases or sudden increases of consumer demand, and the impact of such changes and volatility on our financial position and businesses;\n- the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact across our businesses on demand, operations, our global supply chains and stock price;\n-\npossible disruption in commercial activities or our supply chain due to terrorist activity, cyber-attack, armed conflict, political or financial instability, natural disasters, international trade disputes or major health concerns;\n- loss of intellectual property due to theft, cyber-attack, or disruption to our information technology infrastructure;\n- ability to enforce patents and protect intellectual property and trade secrets;\n- unanticipated disruption to Cornings, our suppliers and manufacturers supply chain, equipment, facilities, IT systems or operations;\n- product demand and industry capacity;\n- competitive products and pricing;\n- availability and costs of critical components, materials, equipment, natural resources and utilities;\n- new product development and commercialization;\n- order activity and demand from major customers;\n- the amount and timing of our cash flows and earnings and other conditions, which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level or to repurchase shares at planned levels;\n- the amount and timing of any future dividends;\n- the effects of acquisitions, dispositions and other similar transactions;\n- the effect of regulatory and legal developments;\n- ability to pace capital spending to anticipated levels of customer demand;\n- our ability to increase margins through implementation of operational changes, pricing actions and cost reduction measures;\n- rate of technology change;\n- adverse litigation;\n- product and component performance issues;\n- retention of key personnel;\n- customer ability to maintain profitable operations and obtain financing to fund ongoing operations and manufacturing expansions and pay receivables when due;\n- loss of significant customers;\n- changes in tax laws, regulations and international tax standards;\n- the impacts of audits by taxing authorities; and\n- the potential impact of legislation, government regulations and other government action and investigations.\nWhile the Company continually reviews trends and uncertainties affecting the Companys results of operations and financial condition, the Company does not assume any obligation to update or supplement any particular forward-looking statements contained in this document, unless required by law. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks\nWe operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:\nExchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and\nExchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nOur most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and the euro. We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts. In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nWe are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties. We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default. Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.\nOur cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers. We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments. These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks. The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies. A significant portion of our non-U.S. revenue is denominated in Japanese yen. When this revenue is translated back to U.S. dollars, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen. To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, we have entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.\nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with foreign currency exposure. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $0.8 billion compared to $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.

Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Companys principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that Cornings disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nDisclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Cornings disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Cornings management, including Cornings principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\n(a)\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning.\nCornings internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Cornings internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Cornings assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and that Cornings receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Cornings management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Cornings assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.\n(b)\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting identified by the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome Taxes - Receivables for South Korean Tax Disputes\nAs described in Notes 1, 7, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the Companys various tax filing positions, management records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the asset or liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company files the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available. The Company is currently appealing certain South Korean tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018. The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessment. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will prevail in the appeals process and as a result, management recorded a non-current receivable of $349 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the receivables for South Korean tax disputes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when applying the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria to the Companys uncertain tax positions based on the application of the tax law; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to managements assumption that the Company will prevail in the appeal of any tax assessment; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to uncertain tax positions, including managements assessment of the South Korean tax disputes. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining managements assessment and evidence supporting the more-likely-than-not tax position on the South Korean tax disputes and evaluating the reasonableness of the likelihood that the tax positions will ultimately be sustained upon examination by the South Korean tax authorities and through the appeals process.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nCorning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, display televisions and other information display applications; carrier network and enterprise network products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy-duty vehicle markets; laboratory products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community; polycrystalline silicon products and other technologies. In these notes, the terms Corning, Company, we, us, or our mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). All intercompany accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated. Investments in partially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when the Company exercises significant influence, which typically occurs when its ownership interest exceeds 20% and the Company does not have a controlling interest. The Companys share of earnings or losses of these affiliated companies is included in the consolidated operating results.\nThe Company consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the entity that may be significant. The Company did not have any material consolidated or nonconsolidated VIEs in its operations for the presented reporting periods.\nOn September 9, 2020, Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG) redeemed the entire ownership interest of DuPont in HSG with a value of $250 million (the Redemption). Upon completion of the Redemption, Corning obtained a 100% interest in HS LLC and an 80.5% interest in HSO LLC, which are affiliated entities within HSG. Since September 9, 2020, HSGs results have been consolidated in Cornings consolidated financial statements and included within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Refer to Note 3 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders equity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, restructuring charges, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, estimates of fair value of investments, equity interests, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nMost of the Companys revenue is generated by delivery of products to customers and recognized at a point in time based on evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products. Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control of the product has been transferred to the customer. If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied. Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements. Shipping and handling fees are treated as fulfillment costs and not as separate performance obligations under the terms of revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales tax, value-added tax and other taxes are collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities and excluded from revenue. Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as an expense.\nAt the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded with the related reduction to revenue for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements. Where product warranties are offered, liabilities are established for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions. Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability. Product warranty liabilities were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIn addition, the Company has contractual arrangements with certain customers, mainly related to Telecommunications products and comprised of design, installation, training and software maintenance services, in which revenue is recognized over time. The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation. Cornings other revenue was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets, such as incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Cornings revenue recognition process. Most of Cornings fulfillment costs as a manufacturer of products are classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types. Other fulfillment costs are immaterial due to the nature of the products and their respective manufacturing processes.\nContract liabilities include customer deposits, deferred revenue and other advanced payments. Customer deposits are primarily related to Display products and deferred revenue is primarily related to HSG. Other advanced payments are not significant to operations and are recorded within other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe determination of the functional currency for Cornings foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors. For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies. Cornings most significant exception is a Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency. For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiarys functional currency, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed. A net foreign currency remeasurement gain of $130 million, gain of $126 million and loss of $37 million was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nForeign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts have been translated at period-end exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts have been translated using average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings, except for those related to intra-entity foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature which are recorded together with translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive loss attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCorning maintains long-term incentive plans (the Plans) for key employees and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The Plans are established to grant equity-based compensation awards, including time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards).\nShare-based compensation cost is allocated to cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe cost of share-based compensation awards is equal to the fair value of the award at the grant date and compensation expense is recognized for awards expected to ultimately vest. The number of awards expected to vest equals the total awards granted less an estimation of the number of forfeitures expected to occur prior to vesting. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts share-based compensation expense based on its probability assessment.\nThe forfeiture rate is calculated based on over 15 years of historical data and is adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates. The effect of any change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a cumulative adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in estimate. For awards containing retirement provisions that are granted to retirement eligible employees, share-based compensation expense is recognized over the period in which the required performance is expected to be met.\nDuring the requisite service period, the Company also recognizes a deferred income tax benefit for the expense recognized. At the time of subsequent vesting, exercise, forfeiture, or expiration of an award, the difference between the Companys actual income tax deduction, if any, and the previously accrued income tax benefit is recognized in income tax expense/benefit during the current period.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nTime-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the Companys common stock upon vesting. The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Companys stock on the grant date. For awards granted to non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors, as there are no vesting terms, the Company recognizes the compensation expense immediately.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are earned upon the achievement of certain targets and are payable in shares of the Companys common stock upon vesting, typically over a three year period. The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the grant date and assumes that the target payout level will be achieved.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nStock Options\nCornings stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued common shares, or treasury shares, at the closing market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in tranches from one year to five years from the grant date. The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date. An award is considered vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the non-substantive vesting period approach).\nCorning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options, which incorporates assumptions including expected volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate, expected term and forfeiture rates. Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption, which is based on the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term and the most recent 15-year historical volatility. The risk-free rate used is the implied rate for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the options expected term. The expected term is the period the options are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued and partial life cycles of outstanding options.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are considered cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nThe following table presents supplemental disclosures of cash flow information (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nNon-cash transactions:\nAccruals for capital expenditures\n$ 414 $ 357 $ 231\nCash paid for interest and income taxes:\nInterest (1)\n$ 275 $ 287 $ 298\nIncome taxes, net of refunds received\n$ 426 $ 377 $ 220\n(1)\nIncludes approximately $48 million, $36 million and $58 million of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, plant and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTrade Accounts Receivable, net of Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable lifetime credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on historical write-off experience and expected future default rate by industry. In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation\nLand, buildings and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 20 years for equipment, excluding precious metals as discussed below. Interest on borrowings is capitalized during the active construction period of major capital projects, added to the cost of the underlying assets and amortized over the useful lives of the assets.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIncluded in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):\nAsset type\nRange of useful life (in years)\nComputer hardware and software\n3 to 7\nManufacturing equipment\n2 to 15\nFurniture and fixtures\n5 to 10\nTransportation equipment\n3 to 20\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals. These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in the Companys manufacturing processes over a very long useful life. The physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on actual units lost. Precious metals are integral to many glass production processes and are only acquired to support operations. These metals are not held for trading or other purposes.\nLeases\nCorning leases certain real estate, vehicles and equipment from third parties, which are classified as operating or finance leases. Right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments for all leases with terms longer than twelve months. To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date or the implicit rate if it is readily determinable. The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components of a contract for its leases.\nRenewal and termination options are included in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when considered to be reasonably certain to be exercised.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases. Interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use assets relating to finance leases are calculated and recognized using the effective interest and straight-line methods, respectively.\nCorning does not have any significant agreements as a lessor.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, is compared to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows, including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if applicable. The recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value.\nThe Company is required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. The Company performs this review each quarter and exercises judgment in assessing whether impairment indicators are present. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs relating to a business within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill relates, and is assigned directly, to a specific reporting unit. Reporting units are either operating segments or one level below the operating segment. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Goodwill is reviewed for indicators of impairment quarterly, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Corning also performs a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years, even if there are no impairment indicators present. This calculation is used as a quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.\nThe qualitative process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of the businesses and forecasted future cash flows. If required to perform the quantitative impairment analysis, the valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return. Estimates are based upon historical experience, current knowledge from commercial relationships and available external information about future trends. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value. The most recent quantitative test was performed in 2020 and the fair value of the Companys reporting units significantly exceeded the respective carrying values.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company receives government assistance, typically in the form of cash incentives primarily for capital expansion projects. Cash incentives received are classified as a liability and recognized when it is probable that the Company will comply with any contractual conditions. Cash incentives relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the relevant asset. Cash incentives relating to project costs or other expenses are recognized in the statements of income as a deduction to the related expense.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash incentives recognized as a reduction of property, plant and equipment or in net income were not material. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $92 million classified within other accrued liabilities and $74 million classified within other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for cash incentives received, which primarily relate to capital expansion projects within Display Technologies and Pharmaceutical Technologies and are expected to be realized over the next 1-2 years.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nThe Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. For sites with multiple potentially responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum undiscounted amount is accrued. When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.\nThe uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the outcome could result in additional costs being recognized by the Company in future periods.\nEquity Method Investments\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had investments in affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method totaling $261 million and $264 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 Corning had sales to affiliated companies of $228 million, $312 million and $253 million, respectively.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine whether there is evidence of a loss in value. For an equity investment with impairment indicators, the fair value is measured based on discounted cash flows, or other appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved. If it is probable that the carrying amount of the investment cannot be recovered, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value.\nAll equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. The Company utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. These investments were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nCorning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents. The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Companys assumptions related to general economic conditions, particularly interest rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care cost trend rates. The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.\nCosts for defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements: (1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and (2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year. These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets. Any interim remeasurement, triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan change, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, is recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.\nCosts for postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity on an annual basis and amortized into operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside the corridor.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized based upon the available evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies.\nThe effective tax rate reflects the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the Companys various tax filing positions, a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions is recorded using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the asset or liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the return containing the tax position is filed or when new information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nDiscrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nGenerally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any subsidiary that lacks sufficient local statutory earnings from which to make a distribution or otherwise lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any subsidiary where Cornings intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiary with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, or (5) any subsidiary where a future distribution would trigger a significant net cost.\n1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nFair Value Measurements\nMajor categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives, are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impaired, which include long-lived assets, goodwill, equity method investments, other investments and asset retirement obligations.\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the principal, or most advantageous, market in which Corning would transact is analyzed. Assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of non-performance, are considered.\nA three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon the observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Companys own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels used to measure fair value: Level 1, quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments, Level 2, significant other observable inputs and Level 3, significant unobservable inputs.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company enters into a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Financial exposure is managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures. The Company also utilizes derivatives that are bifurcated from its precious metals lease contracts to manage the exposure of its separate accounting pool of leased precious metals to changes in market prices.\nAll derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized in current operating results but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded within the same line item of the consolidated statements of income where the underlying hedged transaction was recorded, typically sales, cost of sales or other income (expense), net. Changes in the fair value, excluding the time value component, of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in current operating results within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized within translated earnings contract gain (loss), net and other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-10 Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance (ASU 2021-10). ASU 2021-10 requires business entities to disclose information in the notes to the financial statements about certain types of government assistance. The annual disclosure requirements apply to transactions with a government that are accounted for by analogizing either a grant or a contribution model. The adoption of ASU 2020-10 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.\nRecently issued accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n2. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits\nThe following table presents the restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nSeverance\n$ 70 $ (13 ) $ 148\nAsset impairment\nCapacity optimization\n219 46 304\nOther charges and credits\n125 77 158\nTotal restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits\n$ 414 $ 110 $ 827\nCorning periodically assesses the operating efficiency and cost structure of the Companys asset base and global workforce and takes appropriate actions to align corporate resources with the business environment.\nCorning recorded $414 million in severance, accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and other related charges for the year ended December 31, 2022. Capacity optimization charges include accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs associated with the exit of certain facilities, product lines and other exit activities primarily within Display Technologies, Specialty Materials and an emerging growth business. Severance charges were recorded across all segments and as of December 31, 2022, the severance accrual is not material and is expected to be settled within the next twelve months.\nIn 2020 and in response to uncertain global economic conditions, Corning undertook actions to transform the Companys cost structure and improve operational efficiency. These actions included a corporate-wide workforce reduction program, write-offs of certain assets and accelerated depreciation associated with the capacity optimization of certain manufacturing facilities as well as other exit charges and credits.\nSeverance\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Corning implemented a corporate-wide workforce reduction program. Severance charges were primarily incurred to facilitate realignment of capacity in the Asia regions for the Display Technologies segment, optimize the Optical Communications segment and contain corporate costs.\nAsset Impairment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment of research and development programs relating to a business within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $217 million, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nCapacity Optimization\nCapacity optimization for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily includes accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs associated with the exit of certain facilities and other exit activities in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials business segments.\n2. Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits (Continued)\nThe following tables present the impact and respective location of total restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits in the consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nSelling,\nResearch,\ngeneral\ndevelopment\nand\nand\nGross\nadministrative\nengineering\nmargin (1)\nexpenses\nexpenses\nOther\nTotal\nSeverance\n$ 25 $ 32 $ 13 $ 70\nCapacity optimization\n215 4 219\nOther charges and credits\n97 15 3 $ 10 125\nTotal restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits\n$ 337 $ 51 $ 16 $ 10 $ 414\nYear ended December 31, 2021\nSelling,\nResearch,\ngeneral\ndevelopment\nand\nand\nGross\nadministrative\nengineering\nmargin (1)\nexpenses\nexpenses\nOther\nTotal\nSeverance\n$ (6 ) $ (5 ) $ (2 ) $ (13 )\nCapacity optimization\n36 7 3 46\nOther charges and credits\n50 (5 ) $ 32 77\nTotal restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits\n$ 80 $ (3 ) $ 1 $ 32 $ 110\nYear ended December 31, 2020\nSelling,\nResearch,\ngeneral\ndevelopment\nand\nand\nGross\nadministrative\nengineering\nmargin (1)\nexpenses\nexpenses\nOther\nTotal\nSeverance\n$ 83 $ 34 $ 31 $ 148\nAsset impairment\n6 211 217\nCapacity optimization\n288 16 304\nOther charges and credits\n72 60 5 $ 21 158\nTotal restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits\n$ 443 $ 116 $ 247 $ 21 $ 827\n(1)\nActivity reflected in cost of sales.\n3. HSG Transactions and Acquisitions\nDuring 2020, HSG entered into a series of agreements with DuPont resulting in a change in control of HSG and its consolidation into Corning. Through the agreements, HSG acquired DuPonts TCS manufacturing assets, which was determined to be a business and recorded as a business combination. The fair value of the purchase price was $255 million. In conjunction with this acquisition, HSG settled the pre-existing TCS relationship (TCS Settlement) for a contractual amount of $175 million, which was determined to have a fair value of $200 million. Cornings share of the pre-tax loss related to the TCS Settlement was $81 million and was recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, on September 9, 2020, HSG redeemed DuPonts entire ownership of HSG with a value of $250 million. Upon completion of the Redemption, Corning obtained a 100% interest in HS LLC and 80.5% interest in HSO LLC. Corning accounted for the Redemption under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with business combinations without the transfer of net cash consideration. The Redemption price of $250 million approximated the fair value of Cornings equity interest in HSG immediately preceding the Redemption. The fair value of Cornings equity interest in HSG was estimated by applying the income approach, which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate. The Company used a discount rate of 16.5% and terminal growth rate of zero. As no net-cash consideration was transferred, the fair value of Cornings previously held equity interest in HSG was used to measure the goodwill resulting from the Redemption and the Companys controlling interest after the Redemption.\nCorning recognized a pre-tax gain of $498 million on its previously held equity investment in HSG as a result of the consolidation resulting from the Redemption. The gain was calculated based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the Redemption and included within the transaction-related gain, net in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents the calculation of the gain on previously owned equity (in millions):\nFair value of previously held equity investment\n$ 250\nEquity investment liability balance as of acquisition date\n(248 )\nCorning's gain on previously held equity investment\n$ 498\nSince September 9, 2020, HSGs results have been consolidated in Cornings consolidated financial statements and included within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. The amount of HSGs net income is not material to Cornings consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n4. Revenue\nRevenue Disaggregation Table\nThe following table shows revenue by major product categories, similar to the Companys reportable segment disclosure. Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar. The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar. Except for an insignificant number of Telecommunications products, product category revenues are recognized at the point in time when control transfers to the customer.\nThe following table presents revenues by product category (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nTelecommunication products\n$ 5,023 $ 4,349 $ 3,563\nDisplay products\n2,829 3,666 3,077\nSpecialty glass products\n1,996 2,008 1,884\nEnvironmental substrate and filter products\n1,492 1,584 1,333\nLife science products\n1,187 1,232 981\nPolycrystalline silicon products (1)\n1,191 892 194\nAll other products (1)\n471 351 271\nTotal Revenue\n$ 14,189 $ 14,082 $ 11,303\n(1) Corning obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020 and has consolidated results in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses beginning on September 9, 2020. Refer to Note 3 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCustomer Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.3 billion. Most of these customer deposits were non-refundable and allowed customers to secure rights to products produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements. The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to 10 years. As products are shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, customer deposits recognized were $198 million and $216 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $1.1 billion was recorded in other long-term liabilities. The remaining $132 million and $223 million, respectively, were recorded in other accrued liabilities.\nDeferred Revenue\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had deferred revenue of approximately $869 million and $912 million, respectively. Deferred revenue was primarily related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements.\nDeferred revenue is tracked on a per-customer contract-unit basis. As customers take delivery of the committed volumes under the terms of the contract, a per-unit amount of deferred revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer based upon the units shipped compared to the remaining contractual units. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the amount of deferred revenue recognized in the consolidated statements of income was not material.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $725 million and $764 million, respectively, were recorded in other liabilities and $144 million and $148 million, respectively, were recorded in other accrued liabilities.\nThe value of unsatisfied performance obligations is not disclosed for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue has been recognized at an amount for which the right exists to invoice for services performed.\nSignificant Customers\nFor 2022, 2021 and 2020, no customer met or exceeded 10% of Cornings consolidated net sales.\n5. Inventories\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nFinished goods\n$ 1,315 $ 1,215\nWork in process\n571 358\nRaw materials and accessories\n537 427\nSupplies and packing materials\n481 481\nInventories\n$ 2,904 $ 2,481\n6. Leases\nThe following table presents the components of lease cost (in millions) (1):\nYear ended December 31,\nOperating lease cost\n$ 147 $ 139 $ 133\nVariable lease cost\n51 59 41\nShort-term lease cost\n2 2 4\nTotal lease cost\n$ 200 $ 200 $ 178\n(1)\nFinance lease costs were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table presents the components of cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in millions) (1):\nDecember 31,\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases\n$ 116 $ 134 $ 121\n(1)\nCash payments for operating leases have been classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Principal and interest payments for finance leases have been classified as financing activities and operating activities, respectively, on the consolidated statements of cash flows, and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following table presents supplemental consolidated balance sheet information (in millions, except lease term and discount rate) (1):\nDecember 31,\nLocation of lease balances\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nOther assets\n$ 842 $ 741\nOperating lease liabilities - current\nOther current liabilities\n$ 111 $ 94\nOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent\nOther liabilities\n$ 795 $ 691\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years)\n14.3 12.9\nWeighted-average discount rate\n4.2 % 4.0 %\n(1)\nFinance leases were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n6. Leases (Continued)\nAs of December 31, 2022, maturities of operating lease liabilities are as follows (in millions) (1):\nDecember 31, 2022\n$ 136\n$ 106\n$ 92\n$ 83\n$ 71\nAfter 2027\n$ 756\nTotal operating payments\n$ 1,244\nLess: imputed discount\n$ 338\nPresent value of lease payments\n$ 906\n(1)\nFinance leases were not material as of December 31, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2022, Corning had additional operating leases, primarily for new production facilities, that have not yet commenced or been recorded, of approximately $168 million on an undiscounted basis. These operating leases will commence in 2023 with lease terms of 10 to 20 years.\n7. Income Taxes\nThe following table presents the components of income before income taxes (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nU.S. companies\n$ 1,157 $ 1,282 $ (62 )\nNon-U.S. companies\n640 1,144 696\nIncome before income taxes\n$ 1,797 $ 2,426 $ 634\nThe following table presents the current and deferred amounts of the provision for income taxes (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ (191 ) $ (172 ) $ 88\nState and municipal\n(16 ) (13 ) (16 )\nForeign\n(250 ) (290 ) (203 )\nDeferred:\nFederal\n52 (97 ) 7\nState and municipal\n8 (7 ) 3\nForeign\n(14 ) 88 10\nProvision for income taxes\n$ (411 ) $ (491 ) $ (111 )\nAmounts reflected in the preceding tables are based on the location of the taxing authorities.\n7.

As a result, the deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference between book and tax basis for Cornings investment in HS LLC and HSO LLC was adjusted by approximately $116 million.\nRefer to Note 3 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company distributed approximately $534 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies. As of December 31, 2022, Corning has approximately $1.3 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.\n7. Income Taxes (Continued)\nThe following table presents the tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nLoss and tax credit carryforwards\n$ 281 $ 375\nOther assets\n232 200\nResearch and development capitalization\n280 81\nAsset impairments and restructuring reserves\n41 30\nPostretirement medical and life benefits\n102 154\nOther accrued liabilities\n311 354\nOther employee benefits\n346 329\nGross deferred tax assets\n1,593 1,523\nValuation allowances\n(166 ) (138 )\nTotal deferred tax assets\n1,427 1,385\nIntangible and other assets\n(108 ) (103 )\nFixed assets\n(289 ) (300 )\nFinance leases\n(200 ) (174 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(597 ) (577 )\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ 830 $ 808\nNet deferred tax assets on the consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nDeferred tax assets\n$ 1,073 $ 1,066\nOther liabilities\n(243 ) (258 )\nNet deferred tax assets\n$ 830 $ 808\nThe following table presents details of the deferred tax assets for loss and tax credit carryforwards (in millions):\nExpiration\nTotal\n2023-2027 2028-2032 2033-2042 Indefinite\nNet operating losses\n$ 278 $ 94 $ 27 $ 24 $ 133\nTax credits\n3 3\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$ 281 $ 94 $ 30 $ 24 $ 133\nThe following table presents the changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance (in millions):\nBalance as of January 1\n$ 138 $ 167 $ 215\nAdditions\n81 13 27\nReductions\n(53 ) (42 ) (75 )\nBalance as of December 31\n$ 166 $ 138 $ 167\n7. Income Taxes (Continued)\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\nBalance as of January 1\n$ 178 $ 131 $ 62\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n10 54 19\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n24 17 53\nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(5 ) (21 )\nSettlements and lapse of statute of limitations\n(1 ) (3 ) (3 )\nBalance as of December 31\n$ 206 $ 178 $ 131\nDuring 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) opened an audit for tax years 2015-2018. The Company does not expect additional material exposure for the tax years under audit. However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than the current position, the overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.\nThe additions for tax positions of prior years were primarily due to tax audits, development of tax court cases and tax law changes in various jurisdictions.\nIncluded in the balance as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are $169 million, $120 million and $102 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the Companys effective tax rate if recognized.\nAccrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the amount recognized in interest expense and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties was not material.\nIt is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions. The Company believes that adequate tax reserves are provided for these matters. However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than the current reserves, the Companys overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment. As of December 31, 2022, the Company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nCorning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all 80%-or-more-owned of its U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. The statute of limitations is closed for all periods ending through December 31, 2012. All returns for periods ended through December 31, 2014, have been audited by and settled with the IRS.\nCorning Incorporated and its U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years. Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal. The Company does not expect any material proposed adjustments from any of these audits.\nCornings foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries where their operations are located. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 10 years. The statute of limitations is closed through the following years in these major jurisdictions: China (2008), Japan (2014), Taiwan (2016) and South Korea (2013).\nCorning Precision Materials, a South Korean subsidiary, is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018. The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessment. Corning believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will prevail in the appeals process. The non-current receivable balance was $349 million and $350 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government.\n8.

The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market.\nOn a quarterly basis, Corning will recognize the foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting from changes in exchanges rates within accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity. Cash proceeds from loans and debt issuances are disclosed as financing activities, and cash payments for interest and bond redemptions are disclosed as operating activities and financing activities, respectively, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCorning did not have outstanding commercial paper as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, Corning amended and restated its existing revolving credit agreement, which provides a committed $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit, primarily to extend the term to 2027. Additionally, Corning amended and restated its 25 billion Japanese yen liquidity facility, equivalent to approximately $191 million, primarily to extend the term to 2025. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no outstanding amounts under either the amended and restated or the existing facilities.\n11. Debt (Continued)\nCorning is the obligor to unsecured variable rate loan facilities, with an aggregate capacity of 4,645 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to approximately $673 million, whose proceeds are used for capital investment and general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, these facilities had variable rates ranging from 3.3% to 4.3% and 3.8% to 4.5%, respectively, and maturities ranging from 2023 to 2032. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, amounts outstanding under these facilities totaled $352 million and $277 million, respectively.\nThe following table presents debt maturities by year as of December 31, 2022 (in millions) (1):\nThereafter\n$ 224 $ 284 $ 169 $ 29 $ 403 $ 5,845\n(1)\nExcludes impact of an interest rate swap, bond discounts and deferred expenses.\nDebt Issuances and Redemptions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Corning redeemed $375 million of 2.9% debentures due in 2022 and $250 million of 3.7% debentures due in 2023, paying premiums of $10 million and $19 million, respectively, by exercising the make-whole call. The bond redemptions resulted in an $11 million and $20 million loss, respectively.\nLosses on bond redemption have been recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income.\n12. Employee Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCorning has defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. The Company may contribute, as necessary, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements to achieve the Companys long-term funding targets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, voluntary cash contributions were not material to domestic and international defined benefit plans. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash contributions of $24 million were made to international pension plans. In 2023, the Company plans to make cash contributions of $49 million to international pension plans.\nCorning offers postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents. Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age and service requirements. In 2022 and 2021, no voluntary cash contributions were made to domestic postretirement plans. For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program, Corning has placed a cap on the amount to be contributed toward retiree medical coverage in the future. The cap is equal to 120% of the 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits. Once contributions toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage. This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and attained for pre-65 retirees in 2010. Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical benefits upon retirement; however, these employees will pay 100% of the cost.\n12.

Employee Retirement Plans (Continued)\nAcross total pension benefits, an actuarial gain of $1.1 billion was recognized in 2022 primarily due to increases in bond yields during the year, leading to a domestic and international plan weighted-average discount rates that were 263 and 126 basis points higher, respectively, than the prior year. In 2021, an actuarial gain of $124 million was recognized primarily due to increases in bond yields during the year, leading to domestic and international plan weighted-average discount rates that were 37 and 18 basis points higher, respectively, than the prior year. The accumulated benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans was $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFor postretirement benefits, an actuarial gain of $209 million was recognized in 2022 due to current year increases in bond yields, leading to a weighted-average discount rate that was 259 basis points higher than the prior year. In 2021, an actuarial gain of $105 million was recognized due to current year increases in bond yields, leading to a weighted-average discount rate that was 30 basis points higher than the prior year.\nThe following table presents information for pension plans where the projected benefit obligation or the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nProjected benefit obligation\n$ 3,406 $ 4,358\nFair value of plan assets\n$ 2,712 $ 3,627\nAccumulated benefit obligation\n$ 3,238 $ 4,110\nFair value of plan assets\n$ 2,712 $ 3,627\nThe following table presents the components of net periodic benefit expense (income) for employee retirement plans, which other than the service cost component is recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income (in millions):\nDomestic pension benefits\nInternational pension benefits\nPostretirement benefits\nService cost\n$ 105 $ 102 $ 92 $ 22 $ 25 $ 26 $ 9 $ 10 $ 9\nInterest cost\n98 78 110 11 10 12 15 15 20\nExpected return on plan assets\n(210 ) (209 ) (186 ) (9 ) (7 ) (9 )\nAmortization of prior service cost (credit)\n6 4 6 (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) (5 ) (6 ) (5 )\nAmortization of actuarial (gain) loss\n(5 ) 2 1\nRecognition of actuarial loss\n29 10 12 8 1 10\nTotal net periodic benefit expense (income)\n$ 28 $ (15 ) $ 34 $ 31 $ 28 $ 38 $ 14 $ 21 $ 25\nSettlement charge\nSpecial termination benefit charge\n2 8 1\nTotal expense (income)\n$ 30 $ (15 ) $ 42 $ 33 $ 28 $ 38 $ 14 $ 21 $ 26\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income:\nCurtailment effects\n$ (4 )\nSettlements\n$ 11\nCurrent year actuarial loss (gain)\n$ 16 $ (105 ) $ 94 (27 ) $ (7 ) (11 ) $ (209 ) $ (105 ) $ 58\nAmortization of actuarial gain (loss)\n5 (2 ) (1 )\nRecognition of actuarial (loss) gain\n(29 ) (10 ) (12 ) 20 (1 ) (10 )\nCurrent year prior service cost\n28 1\nAmortization of prior service (cost) credit\n(6 ) (4 ) (6 ) 1 1 1 5 6 5\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income\n$ 9 $ (119 ) $ 77 $ 5 $ (7 ) $ (24 ) $ (199 ) $ (101 ) $ 62\n12. Employee Retirement Plans (Continued)\nCorning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plans projected benefit payments. Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value. The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements and eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency. The curve is developed from yields on hundreds of bonds from four grading sources, Moodys, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service. A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds. The very highest 10% yields and the lowest 40% yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.\nMortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans. It is used to assign a probability of payment for benefits that are contingent upon participants survival. To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale to mortality rates for future anticipated changes to historical death rates.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Corning updated the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (PRI-2012 white collar table and PRI-2012 blue collar table for non-union and union participants, respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligation, with no change in 2022. In addition, Corning also updated to the MP-2020 projection scale and the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants (PRI-2012 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2020) for the year ended December 31, 2020, with no change in 2021 or 2022. As the Society of Actuaries publishes additional mortality improvement scales and base mortality tables, Corning considers these revised schedules in setting its mortality assumptions.\nMeasurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:\nPension benefits\nDomestic\nInternational\nPostretirement benefits\nDiscount rate\n5.50 %\n2.87 %\n2.50 %\n2.46 %\n1.20 %\n1.02 %\n5.58 %\n2.99 %\n2.69 %\nRate of compensation increase\n3.48 %\n3.50 %\n4.16 %\n3.73 %\n3.63 %\n3.55 %\nCash balance crediting rate\n4.14 %\n3.86 %\n3.84 %\n0.82 %\n0.91 %\n0.94 %\nEmployee contributions crediting rate\n4.62 %\n1.57 %\n0.62 %\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense (income):\nPension benefits\nDomestic\nInternational\nPostretirement benefits\nDiscount rate\n2.88 %\n2.50 %\n3.28 %\n1.20 %\n1.02 %\n1.34 %\n2.99 %\n2.69 %\n3.41 %\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.00 %\n6.00 %\n6.00 %\n1.64 %\n1.26 %\n1.71 %\nRate of compensation increase\n3.50 %\n4.16 %\n3.50 %\n3.63 %\n3.55 %\n2.96 %\nCash balance crediting rate\n3.86 %\n3.84 %\n3.94 %\n0.91 %\n0.94 %\n0.97 %\nEmployee contributions crediting rate\n1.57 %\n0.62 %\n2.03 %\nThe following table presents the assumed health care trend rates:\nAssumed health care trend rates as of December 31\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year (pre-65 / post-65 retirees)\n7.00% / 4.25% 6.25% / 6.25%\nUltimate health care trend rate\n5 % 5 %\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n12. Employee Retirement Plans (Continued)\nPlan Assets\nThe Companys primary objective is to ensure the plan has sufficient return on assets to fund the plans current and future obligations as they become due. Investments are primarily made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments. Domestic and international stocks provide diversification to the portfolio. The target allocation range equity investment is 40% which includes large, mid and small-cap companies and investments in both developed and emerging markets. The target allocation for bond investments is 60%, which predominately includes corporate bonds. Long-duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates.\nThe following table presents the fair values of domestic defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plan assets, by asset category (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2022\nDecember 31, 2021\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nEquity securities:\nU.S. companies\n$ 1,168 $ 63 $ 1,105 $ 977 $ 20 $ 957\nInternational companies\n234 234\nFixed income:\nU.S. treasury bonds\n400 400 256 256\nU.S. corporate bonds\n1,060 1,060 1,770 1,770\nPreferred securities\n1 1 11 11\nPrivate equity (1)\n24 $ 24 41 $ 41\nReal estate (2)\n7 7 10 10\nCash equivalents\n28 28 308 308\nTotal\n$ 2,688 $ 491 $ 2,166 $ 31 $ 3,607 $ 584 $ 2,972 $ 51\n(1)\nThis category includes venture capital, leverage buyouts and distressed debt limited partnerships invested primarily in U.S. companies.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nGuarantees\nThe Company is required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of business, the Company does not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant. The Company believes a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.\nPurchase Commitments\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations. The Company has purchase commitments primarily for raw materials and energy-related take-or-pay contracts. Commitments made under these obligations as of December 31, 2022 are as follows (in millions):\nAmount of commitment expiration per period\nLess than 1 year\n1 to 3 years\n3 to 5 years\n5 years and thereafter\nPurchase obligations\n$ 230 $ 212 $ 102 $ 453\nLitigation, Environmental and Indemnifications\nCorning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized below. In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Cornings consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.\nDow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters\nUntil June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) each owned 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning). On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning. Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning. With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow for 50% of Dow Cornings non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits. Corning does not believe that its indemnity obligation will be material.\nDow Corning Environmental Claims\nIn September 2019, Dow formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation and response at a number of sites. In the event Dow is liable for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to 50% of that liability, subject to certain conditions and limits. As of December 31, 2022, Corning has determined a potential liability for these environmental matters is probable, and the amount reserved is not material.\nEnvironmental Litigation\nCorning has been designated by federal or state governments under environmental laws, including Superfund, as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with 19 hazardous waste sites. It is Cornings policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to such hazardous waste sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had accrued approximately $109 million and $55 million, respectively, for the estimated undiscounted liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Companys liability.\n14. Hedging Activities\nCorning is primarily exposed to foreign currency risks due to fluctuations in exchange rates. These fluctuations affect the Companys financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\nThe most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro and British pound. Corning seeks to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in the income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts. In general, the expirations of these contracts coincide with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nCorning is exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative contracts. However, this risk is minimized by maintaining a portfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions. The Company does not expect to record any losses due to counterparty default. Neither the Company nor its counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments. The Company qualified for and elected the end-user exception to the mandatory swap clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nDesignated Hedges\nCorning uses OTC foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers. The total gross notional values for foreign currency cash flow hedges are $419 million and $780 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with maturities through 2024. Corning defers gains and losses related to the cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until the hedged item impacts earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax gain of $20 million.\nCorning has entered into leases of precious metals, with maturities through 2025. To offset the risk of changes in the fair value of the Companys separate accounting pool of leased precious metals due to adverse changes in the respective market prices, Corning designated the bifurcated embedded derivatives included in these leases as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current earnings. The amounts representing the time value component of the derivatives are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and amortized in earnings. The impact of the excluded component on Cornings other comprehensive income and earnings is not material. The carrying amount of the leased precious metals pool, which is included within property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation in the consolidated balance sheets, is $278 million and $107 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The carrying amount of the leased precious metals pool includes cumulative fair value losses of $95 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCorning uses regression analysis or the critical term match method to assess initial hedge effectiveness. Following the inception of a hedging relationship, hedge effectiveness is assessed quarterly based on qualitative factors.\nUndesignated Hedges\nCorning uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes to offset economic currency risks. The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.\nA significant portion of the Companys non-U.S. revenue and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro. When this revenue and these expenses are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements. To protect translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and option contracts. Most of these contracts hedge a significant portion of the Companys exposure to the Japanese yen, with maturities through 2024, and South Korean won, with maturities through 2026.\n14. Hedging Activities (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the total gross notional value for translated earnings contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in billions):\nYear ended December 31,\nAverage rate forward contracts:\nJapanese yen-denominated\n$ 0.1 $ 2.9\nSouth Korean won-denominated\n2.1 1.2\nOther foreign currencies (1)\n0.7 0.3\nOption contracts:\nJapanese yen-denominated (2)\n4.6 3.6\nOther foreign currencies (3)\n0.9\nTotal gross notional value for translated earning contracts\n$ 7.5 $ 8.9\n(1)\nDenominational currencies for average rate forward contracts include the Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar, euro and British pound.\n(2) Japanese yen-denominated option contracts include purchased put and call options and zero-cost collars. With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of the put and call options. However, due to the nature of zero-cost collars, only the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.\n(3) Other foreign currencies option contracts are purchased basket options that include a basket of underlying currencies, including the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro and British pound, and each basket option have been settled against U.S. dollars.\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded currently in earnings within translated earnings contract gain (loss), net in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and respective fair values of Cornings derivative financial instruments on a gross basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\nAsset derivatives\nLiability derivatives\nNotional amount\nFair value\nFair value\nBalance sheet location\nBalance sheet location\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nForeign exchange and precious metals lease contracts (1)\n$ 419 $ 780 Other current assets\n$ 26 $ 49 Other accrued liabilities\n$ (1 ) $ (2 )\nOther assets\n78 10 Other liabilities\n(9 )\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign exchange contracts\n2,231 3,864 Other current assets\n44 91 Other accrued liabilities\n(49 ) (95 )\nTranslated earnings contracts\n7,543 8,899 Other current assets\n384 196 Other accrued liabilities\n(124 ) (47 )\nOther assets\n146 154 Other liabilities\n(17 ) (40 )\nTotal derivatives\n$ 10,193 $ 13,543 $ 678 $ 500 $ (191 ) $ (193 )\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2022, derivatives designated as hedging instruments include foreign exchange cash flow hedges with gross notional amounts of $419 million and fair value hedges of leased precious metals with a gross notional amount of 23,152 troy ounces. As of December 31, 2021, derivatives designated as hedging instruments include foreign exchange cash flow hedges with gross notional amounts of $780 million and fair value hedges of leased precious metals with a gross notional amount of 7,559 troy ounces. Other assets include designated derivatives pertaining to precious metals lease contracts in the amounts of $64 million and $5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n14. Hedging Activities (Continued)\nThe following tables summarize the effect in the consolidated statements of income relating to Cornings derivative financial instruments (in millions). The accumulated derivative gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 is $19 million and $52 million, respectively.\nDerivatives hedging relationships\nGain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI)\nLocation of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income\nGain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI into income\nfor cash flow and fair value hedges\neffective (ineffective)\nNet sales\n$ 52 $ 14 $ (6 )\nCost of sales\n32 39 13\nForeign exchange and precious metals lease contracts\n$ 52 $ 47 $ (19 ) Other income (expense), net (1)\n(3 ) (1 ) (14 )\nTotal cash flow and fair value hedges\n$ 52 $ 47 $ (19 ) $ 81 $ 52 $ (7 )\nGain (loss) recognized in income\nUndesignated derivatives\nLocation of gain (loss) recognized in income\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther income (expense), net\n$ 46 $ 38 $ (93 )\nTranslated earnings contracts\nTranslated earnings contract gain (loss), net\n351 354 (38 )\nTotal undesignated\n$ 397 $ 392 $ (131 )\n(1)\nA loss of $14 million was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into other income (expense), net, resulting from the de-designation of certain cash flow hedges during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n15. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table provides the fair value measurement information for the Companys major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis (in millions):\nFair value measurements at reporting date\nFair value measurements at reporting date\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nCurrent assets:\nOther current assets (1)\n$ 505 $ 2 $ 454 $ 49 $ 352 $ 10 $ 336 $ 6\nNon-current assets:\nOther assets (1)\n$ 225 $ 224 $ 1 $ 175 $ 164 $ 11\nCurrent liabilities:\nOther accrued liabilities (1)\n$ 174 $ 174 $ 144 $ 144\nNon-current liabilities:\nOther liabilities (1)\n$ 34 $ 34 $ 66 $ 66\n(1)\nDerivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange and precious metals lease contracts which are measured using observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThere were no significant financial assets or liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n16. Shareholders Equity\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn February 8, 2023, Cornings Board of Directors declared a $0.28 per share common stock dividend.\nFixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A\nThe Company had 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (the Preferred Stock) as of December 31, 2020. On January 16, 2021, the Preferred Stock became convertible into 115 million common shares. On April 5, 2021 Corning and Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC) executed the Share Repurchase Agreement (SRA), and the Preferred Stock was fully converted as of April 8, 2021. Immediately following the conversion, Corning repurchased and retired 35 million of the common shares held by SDC for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion, of which approximately $507 million was paid on both April 8, 2022 and 2021. The remaining payment of approximately $507 million will be paid on April 8, 2023. The 35 million common shares repurchased by Corning were excluded from the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the calculation of the Companys basic and diluted earnings per share starting on April 8, 2021.\nThe remaining 80 million common shares were accounted for as a conversion of Preferred Stock and resulted in an increase of common stock and additional paid-in-capital based on the carrying value of the Preferred Stock. These common shares were included in the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the calculation of the Companys basic and diluted earnings per share.\nPursuant to the SRA, with respect to the 80 million common shares outstanding held by SDC:\nSDC has the option to sell an additional 22 million common shares to Corning in specified tranches from time to time in calendar years 2024 through 2027. Corning may, at its sole discretion, elect to repurchase such common shares. If Corning elects not to repurchase the common shares and SDC sells the common shares on the open market, Corning will be required to pay SDC a make-whole payment, subject to a 5% cap of the repurchase proceeds that otherwise would have been paid by Corning. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the option was $17 million, when measured using significant other observable inputs.\nThe remaining 58 million shares of common shares are subject to a seven-year lock-up period expiring in 2027.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2019, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2018 repurchase plan (2019 Authorization).\nIn addition to the common shares repurchased under the SRA as discussed above, the Company repurchased 6.0 million, 7.3 million and 4.1 million shares of common stock under its 2019 Authorization for approximately $221 million, $274 million and $105 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately $3.3 billion remains available under the Companys 2019 Authorization.\n16.

Refer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n17. Earnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities outstanding.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the amounts used to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share from operations (in millions, except per share amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,906\n$\nLess: Series A convertible preferred stock dividend\nLess: Excess consideration paid for redemption of preferred shares (1)\nNet income available to common shareholders - basic\n1,316\n1,079\nNet income available to common shareholders - diluted\n$ 1,316\n$ 1,079\n$\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and other dilutive securities\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted\nBasic earnings per common share\n$ 1.56\n$ 1.30\n$ 0.54\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$ 1.54\n$ 1.28\n$ 0.54\nAnti-dilutive potential shares excluded from diluted earnings per common share:\nSeries A convertible preferred stock dividend (1)(2)\nEmployee stock options and awards\nTotal\n(1)\nRefer to Note 16 (Shareholders Equity) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n(2) For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Preferred Stock was anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n18. Share-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents share-based compensation cost and the unrecognized compensation cost by award type (in millions):\nAmount of share-based compensation cost recognized\nUnrecognized compensation cost\nWeighted-average remaining term in years\nYear ended December 31,\nDecember 31,\nTime-based restricted stock and restricted stock units\n$ 111 $ 94 $ 95 $ 150 2.7\nPerformance-based restricted stock units\n52 79 81 17 1.4\nStock Options\n7 9 23 2 0.4\nOther\n5 8 8\nTotal share-based compensation cost (1)\n$ 175 $ 190 $ 207\n(1)\nThe income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was $16 million, $37 million and $12 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 32 million unissued common shares available for future grants authorized under the Plans.\nIncentive Stock Plans\nTime-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes the changes in non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units during the year ended December 31, 2022:\nNumber of shares (in thousands) Weighted-average grant-date fair value\nNon-vested shares and share units as of December 31, 2021\n10,594 $ 25.83\nGranted\n4,680 33.82\nVested\n(3,626 ) 25.44\nForfeited\n(349 ) 28.44\nNon-vested shares and share units as of December 31, 2022\n11,299 $ 29.19\nThe total fair value of time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $93 million, $88 million and $38 million, respectively.\n18.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, there were no performance-based restricted stock units that vested.\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes information concerning stock options as of December 31, 2022 and the related activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nNumber of shares (in thousands)\nWeighted-average exercise price\nWeighted-average remaining contractual term in years\nAggregate intrinsic value (in thousands)\nOptions Outstanding as of December 31, 2021\n11,904 $ 22.31\nExercised\n(2,010 ) 19.80\nForfeited and expired\n(229 ) 18.66\nOptions outstanding as of December 31, 2022\n9,665 22.92 5.78 $ 89,986\nOptions expected to vest as of December 31, 2022\n9,650 22.92 5.78 89,805\nOptions exercisable as of December 31, 2022\n7,895 23.65 5.43 68,233\nThe aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on the Companys closing stock price as of December 30, 2022, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their in-the-money options as of that date.\nThere were no options granted in 2022 or 2021. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $3.67. The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $20 million, $16 million and $31 million, respectively.\nProceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $40 million, with a corresponding realized tax benefit of $5 million, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $36 million, $100 million and $99 million, respectively.\n18. Share-Based Compensation (Continued)\nThe following inputs were used for the valuation of option grants under the stock option plans awarded during 2020:\nExpected volatility and Weighted-average volatility\n32.9 %\nExpected dividends\n4.48 %\nRisk-free rate and Average risk-free rate\n0.5 %\nExpected term (in years)\n7.4\nPre-vesting executive departure rate\n0.6 %\nPre-vesting non-executive departure rate\n2.5 %\n19. Reportable Segments\nThe Company has determined that it has five reportable segments for financial reporting purposes, as follows:\nOptical Communications - manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.\nDisplay Technologies - manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays and other high-performance display panels.\nSpecialty Materials - manufactures products that provide material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.\nEnvironmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for emission control systems.\nLife Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents enabling workflow solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.\nAll other businesses that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. The net sales for this group are primarily attributable to HSG, which is an operating segment that produces solar and semiconductor products. The emerging growth businesses primarily consist of Pharmaceutical Technologies, Auto Glass Solutions and the Emerging Innovations Group.\nFinancial results for the reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of financial information to assist the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in making internal operating decisions. As a significant portion of segment revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on segment net sales and segment net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, the Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact on segment sales and segment net income (loss) from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro, as applicable to the segment. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display Technologies segment. Management utilizes constant-currency reporting based on internally-derived rates, as detailed below, which are closely aligned with the currencies we have hedged.\nThe Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand segment results without the volatility of currency fluctuation, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. Further, it reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.\nConstant-currency rates are as follows and are applied to all periods presented:\nCurrency\nJapanese yen\nKorean won\nChinese yuan\nNew Taiwan dollar\nEuro\nRate\n\u00a5107\n\u20a91,175\n\u00a56.7\nNT$31\n\u20ac.81\n19. Reportable Segments (Continued)\nIn addition, certain income and expenses are excluded from segment net income (loss) and included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to consolidated net income. These items are not used by the CODM in allocating resources or evaluating the results of the segments and include the following: the impact of translating the Japanese yen-denominated debt; the impact of the translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; pension mark-to-market adjustments; and other non-recurring non-operational items. Although these amounts are excluded from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.\nCorning's administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis and such costs and expenses are allocated among the segments differently than they would for stand-alone financial reporting purposes. These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal, finance and supply chain management. Expenses that are not allocated to the segments are included in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to consolidated net income. Segment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.\nThe following provides historical segment information as described above:\nSegment Information (in millions)\nOptical Communications\nDisplay Technologies\nSpecialty Materials\nEnvironmental Technologies\nLife Sciences\nHemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses (1)\nTotal\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\nSegment net sales\n$ 5,023 $ 3,306 $ 2,002 $ 1,584 $ 1,228 $ 1,662 $ 14,805\nDepreciation (2)\n$ 249 $ 547 $ 155 $ 128 $ 60 $ 146 $ 1,285\nResearch, development and engineering expenses (3)\n$ 230 $ 124 $ 222 $ 98 $ 37 $ 163 $ 874\nIncome tax provision (4)\n$ (180 ) $ (203 ) $ (90 ) $ (78 ) $ (40 ) $ (24 ) $ (615 )\nNet income\n$ 661 $ 769 $ 340 $ 292 $ 153 $ 39 $ 2,254\nInvestment in affiliated companies, at equity\n$ 3 $ 102 $ 8 $ 4 $ 144 $ 261\nSegment assets (5)\n$ 3,295 $ 8,104 $ 2,419 $ 2,061 $ 862 $ 2,136 $ 18,877\nCapital expenditures\n$ 368 $ 495 $ 306 $ 110 $ 116 $ 218 $ 1,613\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\nSegment net sales\n$ 4,349 $ 3,700 $ 2,008 $ 1,586 $ 1,234 $ 1,243 $ 14,120\nDepreciation (2)\n$ 224 $ 605 $ 161 $ 139 $ 52 $ 134 $ 1,315\nResearch, development and engineering expenses (3)\n$ 216 $ 110 $ 208 $ 111 $ 33 $ 160 $ 838\nIncome tax (provision) benefit (4)\n$ (152 ) $ (249 ) $ (99 ) $ (72 ) $ (51 ) $ 11 $ (612 )\nNet income (loss)\n$ 553 $ 960 $ 371 $ 269 $ 194 $ (51 ) $ 2,296\nInvestment in affiliated companies, at equity\n$ 3 $ 109 $ 6 $ 4 $ 142 $ 264\nSegment assets (5)\n$ 3,183 $ 8,672 $ 2,328 $ 2,150 $ 791 $ 2,024 $ 19,148\nCapital expenditures\n$ 301 $ 710 $ 183 $ 228 $ 128 $ 149 $ 1,699\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020\nSegment net sales\n$ 3,563 $ 3,172 $ 1,884 $ 1,370 $ 998 $ 465 $ 11,452\nDepreciation (2)\n$ 242 $ 548 $ 162 $ 132 $ 50 $ 81 $ 1,215\nResearch, development and engineering expenses (3)\n$ 204 $ 99 $ 155 $ 100 $ 26 $ 170 $ 754\nIncome tax (provision) benefit (4)\n$ (101 ) $ (190 ) $ (113 ) $ (52 ) $ (37 ) $ 58 $ (435 )\nNet income (loss)\n$ 366 $ 717 $ 423 $ 197 $ 139 $ (214 ) $ 1,628\nInvestment in affiliated companies, at equity\n$ 3 $ 107 $ 4 $ 2 $ 142 $ 258\nSegment assets (5)\n$ 2,868 $ 8,842 $ 2,571 $ 1,986 $ 683 $ 2,157 $ 19,107\nCapital expenditures\n$ 127 $ 311 $ 125 $ 159 $ 83 $ 123 $ 928\n(1) Corning obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020 and has consolidated results in Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses since September 9, 2020.
