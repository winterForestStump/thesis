AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nNote 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nA. Basis of Presentation\nWe prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted.\nThese financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2022 Form 10-K. Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.\nPfizers fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three and six months ended May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, and for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022.\nWe manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A below and Note 17A in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nBusiness development activities impacted financial results in the periods presented. In March 2023, we and Seagen announced that the companies entered into an agreement under which we will acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer medicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. We expect to finance the transaction substantially through $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023 (see Note 7D), and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The transaction was approved by Seagens shareholders in May 2023. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. See Note 2 below, as well as Notes 1A and 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nWe have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for segment reporting.\nB. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial statements. See Note 8C.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the guidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023. We applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to continue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.\nC. Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable\nCustomers--Our prescription biopharmaceutical products, with the exception of Paxlovid, are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. We principally sell Paxlovid to government agencies and distributors. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines directly to the federal government (including the CDC), wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery systems. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions.\nDeductions from Revenues--Our accruals for Medicare, Medicaid and related state program and performance-based contract rebates, chargebacks, sales allowances and sales returns and cash discounts are as follows:\n(MILLIONS) July 2,\n2023 December 31, 2022\nReserve against Trade accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts\n$ 1,236 $ 1,200\nOther current liabilities:\nAccrued rebates 4,868 4,479\nOther accruals 412 430\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n473 612\nTotal accrued rebates and other sales-related accruals $ 6,989 $ 6,722\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nTrade Accounts Receivable--Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.\nIn determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.\nDuring the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see Note 1G in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nNote 2. Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations, Equity-Method Investment and Research and Development Arrangement\nA. Acquisitions\nGBT--On October 5, 2022, we acquired GBT, a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery, development and delivery of life-changing treatments for underserved patient communities, starting with sickle cell disease. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $5.7 billion ($5.2 billion, net of cash acquired). In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $4.4 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $3.0 billion of IPR&D and $1.4 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of six years, (ii) $1.1 billion of Goodwill, (iii) $672 million of inventories to be sold over approximately three years, (iv) $568 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (v) $331 million of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.\nBiohaven--On October 3, 2022, we acquired Biohaven, the maker of Nurtec ODT/Vydura (rimegepant), an innovative therapy approved for both acute treatment of migraine and prevention of episodic migraine in adults. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.8 billion, which includes the fair value of Pfizers previous investment in Biohaven on the acquisition date of approximately $300 million. In connection with this business combination, we provisionally recorded: (i) $12.1 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $11.6 billion of developed technology rights with a useful life of 11 years and $450 million of IPR&D, (ii) $813 million of inventories to be sold over approximately two years, (iii) $795 million of Goodwill, (iv) $398 million of trade accounts receivable, (v) $1.4 billion of assumed long-term debt that was paid in full in the fourth quarter of 2022, (vi) $566 million of net deferred tax liabilities and (vii) $476 million of Other current liabilities. The allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized.\nArena--On March 11, 2022, we acquired Arena, a clinical stage company with development-stage therapeutic candidates in gastroenterology, dermatology and cardiology. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $6.6 billion ($6.2 billion, net of cash acquired). The final allocation of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed was completed in the first quarter of 2023. In connection with this business combination, we recorded: (i) $5.5 billion in Identifiable intangible assets, consisting of $5.0 billion of IPR&D and $460 million of indefinite-lived licensing agreements and other, (ii) $1.0 billion of Goodwill and (iii) $490 million of net deferred tax liabilities.\nB. Discontinued Operations\nDiscontinued operations--net of tax in the periods presented relate to post-close adjustments for previously divested businesses. In the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, amounts recorded under interim agreements, including TSAs and MSAs, associated with these disposals were not material. Under agreements related to the 2020 spin-off and the combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to form Viatris, net amounts due to Viatris were $25 million as of July 2, 2023 and $94 million as of December 31, 2022. The cash flows associated with the agreements are included in Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities. For information about the nature of these agreements, see Note 2B in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nC. Equity-Method Investment\nHaleon/Consumer Healthcare JV--On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nconsumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.\nThe carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 is $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6) and our share of Haleons earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions--net. Our total share of Haleons earnings generated in the first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2023, was $151 million. Our total share of Haleons earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2023, was $219 million. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2022, was $150 million. Our total share of the JVs earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2022, was $335 million. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is included in Other (income)/deductions-net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented.

Research and Development Arrangement\nResearch and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone--In April 2023, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will receive up to a total of $550 million in 2023 through 2026 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. The reduction to Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials. Fixed milestone payments due upon approval will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $550 million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales, as well as royalties based on a mid-to-high single digit percentage of the applicable net sales. Fixed sales-based milestone payments will be recorded as intangible assets and amortized to Amortization of intangible assets over the shorter of the term of the agreement or estimated commercial life of the product, and royalties on net sales will be recorded as Cost of sales when incurred.\nPFIZER INC.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nA. Transforming to a More Focused Company Program\nIn 2019, we announced that we would be incurring costs associated with our Transforming to a More Focused Company Program, a multi-year effort to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our operating structure following Pfizers transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based global biopharmaceutical business. This program includes activities to (i) restructure our corporate enabling functions to appropriately support our operating structure; (ii) transform our commercial go-to-market model; and (iii) optimize our manufacturing network and R&D operations.\nThe activities associated with transforming our commercial go-to-market model are substantially complete. Activities associated with restructuring our corporate enabling functions and optimizing our manufacturing network and R&D operations are ongoing and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023. The costs to restructure our corporate enabling functions, and to optimize our R&D operations and reduce cycle times, as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio, primarily include severance and implementation costs. The costs to optimize our manufacturing network largely include severance, implementation costs, product transfer costs, site exit costs, and accelerated depreciation.\nFrom the start of this program in the fourth quarter of 2019 through July 2, 2023, we incurred costs of $3.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion ($1.1 billion of restructuring charges) is associated with Biopharma. We have incurred approximately 85% of total expected costs to date, and we expect the remaining costs to be substantially incurred through 2023.\nB.

(Cerevel). The net losses in the first six months of 2023 include, among other things, unrealized losses of $276 million related to our investment in BioNTech. The net losses in 2022 included, among other things, unrealized losses of $432 million in the second quarter and $776 million in the first six months related to our investments in BioNTech and Cerevel.\n(c)The second quarter and first six months of 2023 primarily include certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The second quarter and first six months of 2022 primarily included certain product liability expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The first six months of 2022 also included legal obligations related to pre-acquisition commitments.\n(d)The first six months of 2023 primarily represents intangible asset impairment charges, including $128 million associated with Other business activities, related to IPR&D and developed technology rights for acquired software assets and reflects unfavorable pivotal trial results and updated commercial forecasts, and $120 million associated with our Biopharma segment resulting from the discontinuation of a study related to an out-licensed IPR&D asset for the treatment of prostate cancer, acquired in our Array BioPharma Inc. acquisition.\n(e)See Note 2C.\n(f)The first six months of 2023 primarily includes, among other things, dividend income of $211 million from our investment in Nimbus resulting from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limiteds acquisition of Nimbuss oral, selective allosteric tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor program subsidiary, and $183 million from our investment in ViiV.\nPFIZER INC.

See also Note 1E in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n(b)Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2023. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.\nNote 5. Tax Matters\nA. Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations\nOur effective tax rate for continuing operations was (3.1)% for the second quarter of 2023, compared to 13.7% for the second quarter of 2022, and was 7.5% for the first six months of 2023, compared to 13.4% for the first six months of 2022. The negative effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 and the lower effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2022, were primarily due to tax benefits in the second quarter of 2023 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years and a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nWe elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date. The sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of July 2, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards.\nB. Tax Contingencies\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.\nThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years 2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.\nSee Note 5D in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nPFIZER INC.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nForeign Exchange Risk--A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.\nThe derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar and Canadian dollar, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to protect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.\nInterest Rate Risk--Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.\nThe following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts:\nJuly 2, 2023 December 31, 2022\nFair Value Fair Value\n(MILLIONS) Notional Asset Liability Notional Asset Liability\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts(a)\n$ 24,145 $ 630 $ 1,095 $ 26,603 $ 838 $ 1,196\nInterest rate contracts 2,250 - 333 2,250 - 331\n630 1,428 838 1,527\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 22,630 223 178 $ 29,814 240 362\nTotal $ 853 $ 1,606 $ 1,078 $ 1,889\n(a)The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts hedging our intercompany forecasted inventory sales was $4.6 billion as of July 2, 2023 and $4.4 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nPFIZER INC.

COS = Cost of Sales, included in Cost of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of income. OCI = Other comprehensive income/(loss), included in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(b)The amounts reclassified from OCI into COS were:\na net gain of $55 million in the second quarter of 2023;\na net gain of $146 million in the first six months of 2023;\na net gain of $68 million in the second quarter of 2022; and\na net gain of $102 million in the first six months of 2022.\nThe remaining amounts were reclassified from OCI into OID. Based on quarter-end foreign exchange rates that are subject to change, we expect to reclassify a pre-tax gain of $208 million within the next 12 months into income. The maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future foreign exchange cash flows is approximately 20 years and relates to foreign currency debt.\n(c)The amounts reclassified from OCI were reclassified into OID.\n(d)Short-term borrowings and long-term debt include foreign currency borrowings, which are used in net investment hedges. The related long-term debt carrying values as of July 2, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were $812 million and $795 million, respectively.\nThe following summarizes cumulative basis adjustments to our debt in fair value hedges:\nJuly 2, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Increase/(Decrease) to\nCarrying Amount Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Increase/(Decrease) to\nCarrying Amount\n(MILLIONS) Carrying Amount of Hedged Assets/Liabilities(a)\nActive Hedging Relationships Discontinued Hedging Relationships Carrying Amount of Hedged Assets/Liabilities(a)\nActive Hedging Relationships Discontinued Hedging Relationships\nShort-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt $ - $ - $ 13 $ - $ - $ 10\nLong-term debt $ 2,236 $ (318) $ 989 $ 2,235 $ (321) $ 1,042\n(a)Carrying amounts exclude the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments.\nF. Credit Risk\nA significant portion of our trade accounts receivable balances are due from wholesalers and governments. For additional information on our trade accounts receivables with significant customers, see Note 13C below and Note 17C in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nAs of July 2, 2023, the largest investment exposures in our portfolio consist primarily of money market funds mainly invested in U.S. Treasury and government debt, as well as sovereign debt instruments issued by the U.S., Germany, Canada, Japan, and France.\nWith respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $854 million, for which we have posted collateral of $867 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term investments. As of July 2, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $422 million, for which we have received collateral of $366 million with a corresponding amount reported in Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt.\nNote 8.

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n(b)Included in Other noncurrent assets. Based on our current estimates and assumptions, there are no recoverability issues for these amounts, which are primarily related to Paxlovid.\nB. Other Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities includes, among other things, amounts payable to BioNTech for the gross profit split for Comirnaty, which totaled $1.3 billion as of July 2, 2023 and $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nC. Supplier Finance Program Obligation\nWe maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating financial institutions. Under these agreements, participating suppliers may voluntarily elect to sell their accounts receivable with Pfizer to these financial institutions. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers decision to participate and we pay the financial institutions the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the original maturity dates, which is generally within 90 to 120 days of the invoice date. The agreements with the financial institutions do not require Pfizer to provide assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees for the supplier finance program. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within trade payables in our consolidated balance sheet. As of July 2, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, $779 million and $849 million of our trade payables to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding.\nNote 9.

Contingencies and Certain Commitments\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see Note 5B.\nA. Legal Proceedings\nOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:\nPatent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.\nProduct liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.\nCommercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.\nGovernment investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.\nWe believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nWe have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.\nAmounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.\nThe principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a readers judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.\nA1. Legal Proceedings--Patent Litigation\nWe are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In November 2022, BMS received permission to appeal the High Courts decision and the appeal hearing was held in April 2023. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.\nWe also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. For example, we have challenged certain of GSKs RSV vaccine patents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partners patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitors vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.\nWe are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nproduct of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product.

Legal Proceedings--Product Litigation\nWe are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.\nAsbestos\nBetween 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.\nNumerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.\nThere also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.\nEffexor\nBeginning in 2011, actions, including purported class actions, were filed in various federal courts against Wyeth and, in certain of the actions, affiliates of Wyeth and certain other defendants relating to Effexor XR, which is the extended-release formulation of Effexor. The plaintiffs in each of the class actions seek to represent a class consisting of all persons in the U.S. and its territories who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR from any of the defendants from June 14, 2008 until the time the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct ceased. The plaintiffs in all of the actions allege delay in the launch of generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories, in violation of federal antitrust laws and, in certain of the actions, the antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws of certain states, as the result of Wyeth fraudulently obtaining and improperly listing certain patents for Effexor XR in the Orange Book, enforcing certain patents for Effexor XR and entering into a litigation settlement agreement with a generic drug manufacturer with respect to Effexor XR. Each of the plaintiffs seeks treble damages (for itself in the individual actions or on behalf of the putative class in the purported class actions) for alleged price overcharges for Effexor XR or generic Effexor XR in the U.S. and its territories since June 14, 2008. All of these actions have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn 2014, the District Court dismissed the direct purchaser plaintiffs claims based on the litigation settlement agreement, but declined to dismiss the other direct purchaser plaintiff claims. In 2015, the District Court entered partial final judgments as to all settlement agreement claims, including those asserted by direct purchasers and end-payer plaintiffs, which plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nLipitor\nBeginning in 2011, purported class actions relating to Lipitor were filed in various federal courts against, among others, Pfizer, certain Pfizer affiliates, and, in most of the actions, Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited (Ranbaxy) and certain Ranbaxy affiliates. The plaintiffs in these various actions seek to represent nationwide, multi-state or statewide classes consisting of persons or entities who directly purchased, indirectly purchased or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) from any of the defendants from March 2010 until the cessation of the defendants allegedly unlawful conduct (the Class Period). The plaintiffs allege delay in the launch of generic Lipitor, in violation of federal antitrust laws and/\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nor state antitrust, consumer protection and various other laws, resulting from (i) the 2008 agreement pursuant to which Pfizer and Ranbaxy settled certain patent litigation involving Lipitor and Pfizer granted Ranbaxy a license to sell a generic version of Lipitor in various markets beginning on varying dates, and (ii) in certain of the actions, the procurement and/or enforcement of certain patents for Lipitor. Each of the actions seeks, among other things, treble damages on behalf of the putative class for alleged price overcharges for Lipitor (or, in certain of the actions, generic Lipitor) during the Class Period. In addition, individual actions have been filed against Pfizer, Ranbaxy and certain of their affiliates, among others, that assert claims and seek relief for the plaintiffs that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above. These various actions have been consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn September 2013 and 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of the direct purchasers. In October and November 2014, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the claims of all other MDL plaintiffs. All plaintiffs appealed the District Courts orders dismissing their claims with prejudice to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In addition, the direct purchaser class plaintiffs appealed the order denying their motion to amend the judgment and for leave to amend their complaint to the Court of Appeals. In 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decisions and remanded the claims to the District Court.\nAlso, in 2013, the State of West Virginia filed an action in West Virginia state court against Pfizer and Ranbaxy, among others, that asserts claims and seeks relief on behalf of the State of West Virginia and residents of that state that are substantially similar to the claims asserted and the relief sought in the purported class actions described above.\nEpiPen (Direct Purchaser)\nIn February 2020, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against Pfizer, its current and former affiliates King and Meridian, and various Mylan entities, on behalf of a purported U.S. nationwide class of direct purchaser plaintiffs who purchased EpiPen devices directly from the defendants. Plaintiffs in this action generally allege that Pfizer and Mylan conspired to delay market entry of generic EpiPen through the settlement of patent litigation regarding EpiPen, and thereby delayed market entry of generic EpiPen in violation of federal antitrust law. Plaintiffs seek treble damages for alleged overcharges for EpiPen since 2011. In July 2021, the District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the direct purchaser complaint, without prejudice. In September 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In August 2022, the District Court granted Pfizers motion to dismiss the complaint, and plaintiffs have appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.\nNexium 24HR and Protonix\nA number of individual and multi-plaintiff lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer, certain of its subsidiaries and/or other pharmaceutical manufacturers in various federal and state courts alleging that the plaintiffs developed kidney-related injuries purportedly as a result of the ingestion of certain proton pump inhibitors. The cases against Pfizer involve Protonix and/or Nexium 24HR and seek compensatory and punitive damages and, in some cases, treble damages, restitution or disgorgement. In 2017, the federal actions were ordered transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. As part of the combination of our and GSKs consumer healthcare businesses to form Haleon, Haleon assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pfizer for, liabilities arising out of such litigation to the extent related to Nexium 24HR. In June 2023, the parties reached an agreement to resolve the litigation related to Protonix on terms not material to Pfizer.\nDocetaxel\nPersonal Injury Actions\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss.

Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.\nIn 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nMississippi Attorney General Government Action\nIn 2018, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a complaint in Mississippi state court against the manufacturer of the branded product and eight other manufacturers including Pfizer and Hospira, alleging, with respect to Pfizer and Hospira, a failure to warn about a risk of permanent hair loss in violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act. The action seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nZantac\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson & Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL have filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, asserting a consolidated consumer class action alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, and dismissed the litigation.\nIn addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts.\nChantix\nBeginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizers voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to a MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions have been filed in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix.\nA3. Legal Proceedings--Commercial and Other Matters\nMonsanto-Related Matters\nIn 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.\nIn connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacias former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nIn connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutias indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsantos chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutias and New Monsantos assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsantos chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsantos chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.\nPFIZER INC.

We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.\nWe are a party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.\nContracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health\nIn 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health, and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Courts decision. In February 2022, the defendants filed for en banc review of the Court of Appeals decision.

Plaintiff seeks damages, costs and expenses and other equitable and injunctive relief.\nA4. Legal Proceedings--Government Investigations\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a qui tam lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.\nGreenstone Investigations\nU.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division Investigation\nSince July 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division has been investigating our former Greenstone generics business.

In March 2023, the California Department of Insurance issued a subpoena seeking records similar to those requested by the CID. Biohaven is a wholly-owned subsidiary that we acquired in October 2022. We are producing records in response to these requests.\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nU.S. Department of Justice Inquiry relating to Mexico Operations\nIn March 2023, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justices FCPA Unit seeking documents relating to our operations in Mexico. We are producing records pursuant to this request.\nGovernment Inquiries relating to Xeljanz\nIn April 2023, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Virginia, in coordination with the Department of Justices Commercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and information related to programs Pfizer sponsored in retail pharmacies relating to Xeljanz. We are producing records pursuant to this request.\nB. Guarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of July 2, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.\nIn addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.\nSee Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.\nWe have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer.\nC. Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions\nWe may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nNote 13. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\nA. Segment Information\nWe manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizers R&D focus areas. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.\nOther Business Activities and Reconciling Items--Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with: (i) R&D and medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization and costs associated with our GPD organization; (ii) corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs; (iii) overhead costs primarily associated with our manufacturing operations; and (iv) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nSegment Assets--We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $220 billion as of July 2, 2023 and $197 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nSelected Income Statement Information\nThe following provides selected income statement information by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\nRevenues Earnings(a)\nRevenues Earnings(a)\n(MILLIONS) July 2,\n2023 July 3,\n2022 July 2,\n2023 July 3,\n2022 July 2,\n2023 July 3,\n2022 July 2,\n2023 July 3,\nReportable Segment:\nBiopharma $ 12,418 $ 27,425 $ 7,003 $ 17,166 $ 30,389 $ 52,748 $ 17,939 $ 30,557\nOther business activities(b)\n316 317 (2,871) (3,384) 626 655 (5,605) (5,812)\nReconciling Items:\nAmortization of intangible assets (1,184) (822) (2,287) (1,657)\nAcquisition-related items (387) (82) (550) (269)\nCertain significant items(c)\n(293) (1,431) (958) (2,322)\n$ 12,734 $ 27,742 $ 2,269 $ 11,447 $ 31,015 $ 53,402 $ 8,539 $ 20,497\n(a)Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. Biopharmas earnings include dividend income from our investment in ViiV of $91 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $69 million in the second quarter of 2022, and $183 million in the first six months of 2023 and $125 million in the first six months of 2022. In connection with the organizational changes effective in the third quarter of 2022, certain functions transferred between Biopharma and corporate enabling functions and certain activities were realigned within the GPD organization. We have reclassified $58 million of costs in the second quarter of 2022 and $105 million in the first six months of 2022 from corporate enabling functions, which are included in Other business activities, to Biopharma to conform to the current period presentation.\n(b)Other business activities include revenues and costs associated with Business Innovation and costs that we do not allocate to our operating segments, per above, including acquired IPR&D expenses in the periods presented. Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 include approximately $140 million and $260 million, respectively, of write-offs to Cost of sales of inventory related to COVID-19 products that exceeded or were expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used. Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 included a $450 million write-off to Cost of sales of inventory related to COVID-19 products that exceeded or were expected to exceed their approved shelf-lives prior to being used.\n(c)Certain significant items are substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items (as noted above). Earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2022 included, among other items, net losses on equity securities of $539 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, recorded in Other (income)/deductions--net.

The amended agreement includes rephasing of delivery of doses annually through 2026 and an aggregate volume reduction, providing additional flexibility for EU member states. The EC will maintain access to future adapted COVID-19 vaccines and the ability to donate doses, in alignment with the original agreement. See Note 13C.\nC. Other Revenue Information\nSignificant Customers--For information on our significant wholesale customers, see Note 17C in our 2022 Form 10-K. Additionally, revenues from the U.S. government represented 1% and 9% of total revenues for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023, respectively, and 26% and 22% of total revenues for the three and six months ended July 3, 2022, respectively. Accounts receivable from the U.S. government represented less than 1% and 4% of total trade accounts receivable as of July 2, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Revenues and accounts receivable from the U.S. government primarily represent sales of Paxlovid and Comirnaty.\nPFIZER INC.

See footnote (e) below.\n(c)Immunoglobulin (Ig) portfolio includes the revenues from Panzyga, Octagam and Cutaquig.\n(d)Erbitux\u00ae is a registered trademark of ImClone LLC.\n(e)PC1 includes revenues from our contract manufacturing, including certain Comirnaty-related manufacturing activities performed on behalf of BioNTech ($6 million and $10 million for the second quarter and the first six months of 2023, respectively, and $55 million and $101 million for the second quarter and the first six months of 2022, respectively), and revenues from our active pharmaceutical ingredient sales operation, as well as revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with former legacy Pfizer businesses/partnerships.\nRemaining Performance Obligations--Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty to our customers totaled approximately $9 billion as of July 2, 2023, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of this amount, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2023 through 2026, the timing and terms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal second quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year.\nDeferred Revenues--Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $1.2 billion as of July 2, 2023, with $1.2 billion and $28 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred revenues during the first six months of 2023 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the products to our customers, partially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts and the impact of foreign exchange. During the second quarter and first six months of 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $300 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of Comirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of July 2, 2023 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as we transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in 2024. Deferred revenues associated with contracts for other products were not significant as of July 2, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and Strategy--Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizers near- and longer-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently acquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception and through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this program, see the Costs and Expenses--Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing how our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by a new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the Item 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development Initiatives--We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business development activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio--In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)--In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by leveraging Flagships ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and royalties for each successfully commercialized program.\nTermination of Collaboration Arrangement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA)--In March 2023, it was announced that our alliance with Merck KGaA to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio (avelumab) will terminate. Effective June 30, 2023, Merck KGaA took full control of the global commercialization of Bavencio. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the current profit share will be replaced by a 15% royalty to Pfizer on net sales of Bavencio. We and Merck KGaA will continue to operationalize our respective ongoing clinical trials for Bavencio; and Merck KGaA will control all future R&D activities.\nFor a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 23, 2023, the filing date of our 2022 Form 10-K, see Note 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Second Quarter 2023 and First Six Months of 2023 Performance\nRevenues--Revenues decreased $15.0 billion, or 54%, in the second quarter of 2023 to $12.7 billion from $27.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $14.7 billion, or 53%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $283 million, or 1%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $537 million, or 5%, operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, and strong growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially offset by declines in Inflectra in the U.S. and Ibrance.\nRevenues decreased $22.4 billion, or 42%, in the first six months of 2023 to $31.0 billion from $53.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an operational decrease of $21.4 billion, or 40%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 2%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by declines in Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, operationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, as well as strong growth from the Vyndaqel family and Eliquis, and increased Sulperazon revenues in China in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decline in Ibrance.\nAs of August 1, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $67 billion to $70 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the midpoint from 2022 results, which we expect will also have an unfavorable impact on Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income. The total company expected revenue declines in 2023 are driven by an expected reduction in sales of our COVID-19 products, partially offset by expected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, anticipated new product and indication launches, and recently acquired products.\nSee the Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. See also The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations, risks and uncertainties for 2023. For information regarding the primary indications or class of certain products, see Note 13C.\nIncome from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income--The decreases in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $9.2 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and $12.0 billion in the first six months of 2023, compared to the same periods in 2022, were primarily due to lower revenues and an increase in Selling, informational and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower Cost of sales and net gains on equity securities in the second quarter of 2023 versus net losses recognized in the second quarter of 2022, and lower net losses on equity securities for the first six months of 2023.\nSee the Analysis of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&A and Note 4. See also The Global Economic Environment--COVID-19 section below for information about our COVID-19 products, including expectations for 2023. For information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&A and Note 5.\nOur Operating Environment--We, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below, as well as in the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe refer to the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our Operating Environment and -The Global Economic Environment sections and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results section within MD&A of this Form 10-Q and of our 2022 Form 10-K and to the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K. We are including the following risk factors, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors discussed in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nPROPOSED ACQUISITION OF SEAGEN\nWe may be unable to complete the acquisition of Seagen within the anticipated timeframe or at all, which could prevent us from receiving the anticipated benefits from the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all.\nOn March 12, 2023, we entered into a merger agreement with Seagen. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. As a result, there is no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe or at all. In addition, Pfizer may be required to pay Seagen a reverse termination fee of approximately $2.22 billion, subject to certain limitations set forth in the merger agreement, if the merger agreement is terminated by either party as a result of certain antitrust and/or foreign direct investment law-related conditions. Any failure to consummate the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all could prevent Pfizer from receiving the expected benefits from the acquisition. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook-Our Business Development Initiatives and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results sections within MD&A.\nWe have expended and will continue to expend significant time and resources in connection with the acquisition of Seagen and have incurred substantial indebtedness to fund the acquisition.\nPfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and expenses related to the acquisition of Seagen, many of which must be paid regardless of whether the acquisition is consummated. For example, such time, resources and expenses will be incurred in connection with seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction. We intend to finance a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023, plus additional short-term indebtedness to be issued prior to the acquisition, which indebtedness may limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and executing potential business development transactions, such as our acquisition of Seagen, or realizing the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any historical or potential business development transaction, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our growth objectives.\nWe have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by accelerating revenue growth by not only advancing our own product pipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances, licenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our proposed acquisition of Seagen is part of that accelerated revenue growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. The success of our business development activities is dependent on the availability and accurate evaluation of appropriate opportunities, competition from others that are seeking similar opportunities and our ability to successfully identify, structure and execute transactions, including the ability to satisfy or waive closing conditions in the anticipated timeframes, or at all, and our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and develop and commercialize acquired products. Pursuing, executing and consummating these transactions may require substantial investment, which may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings or limit our operating or financial flexibility relative to our current position. The success of our business development transactions depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are\noutside of our control, including the possibility that the expected benefits from such transactions will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period. Unsuccessful clinical trials, regulatory hurdles and commercialization challenges may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from acquired products and businesses. We may fail to generate expected revenue growth for our existing products, product pipeline and acquired products or businesses or we may fail to achieve anticipated cost savings, such as those expected with respect to Seagen, within expected time frames or at all, which may impact our ability to meet our growth objectives. In certain transactions, we may agree to provide certain transition services for an extended period of time, which may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our business. Similarly, the accretive impact anticipated from transactions may not be realized or may be delayed. Integration of these products or businesses may result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, including third-party relationships, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities through, among other things, due diligence, we may be exposed to risks and liabilities as a result of business development transactions. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses or enter into strategic business relationships on favorable terms ahead of our competitors, or that such acquisitions or strategic business development relationships will be accretive to earnings or improve our competitive position.
