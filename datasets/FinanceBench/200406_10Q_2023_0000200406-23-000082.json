Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect managements assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as plans, expects, will, anticipates, estimates, and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Companys strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.\nBecause forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Companys control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Companys actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\nRisks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition\nChallenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Companys continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;\nChallenges to the Companys ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;\nThe impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;\nIncreasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Companys patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;\nCompetition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;\nCompetition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;\nCompetition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and\nAllegations that the Companys products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.\nRisks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity\nProduct efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;\nThe impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;\nThe impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;\nIncreased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;\nFailure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;\nPotential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations, including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection; and sourcing of raw materials;\nCompliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Companys ability to manufacture or sell its products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other requirements such as the European Unions Medical Devices Regulation;\nChanges in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and\nThe issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Related to the Companys Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned Separation of the Companys Consumer Health Business\nPricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments increasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;\nRestricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;\nChallenges to the Companys ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;\nThe potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\nThe potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;\nThe Companys ability to consummate the planned full separation of the Companys Consumer Health business on a timely basis or at all;\nThe Companys ability to successfully separate the Companys Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated benefits from the planned full separation; and\nKenvue, Inc.'s (Kenvue) ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally\nThe risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign governments in countries in which the Company operates;\nThe impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;\nPotential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;\nThe impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk, possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international governments and legal systems;\nThe impact of global public health crises and pandemics;\nChanges to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Companys products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Companys products and operations; and\nThe impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.\nRisks Related to Supply Chain and Operations\nDifficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages, withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;\nInterruptions and breaches of the Companys information technology systems or those of the Companys vendors, which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action;\nReliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the Companys products; and\nThe potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory authorities.\nInvestors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in   Item 2 - MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSales to Customers\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor the fiscal six months of 2023, worldwide sales were $50.3 billion, a total increase of 6.0%, including an operational increase of 8.2% as compared to 2022 fiscal six months sales of $47.4 billion.

Additionally, growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to share gains and market growth partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nThe latest expiring United States composition of matter patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) expires in September 2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. In May 2023, the Company settled litigation with Amgen under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of the settlement and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025.\nInfectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 16.6% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue.\nNeuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 5.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches in the U.S. and Europe. Growth was partially offset by declines from the paliperidone long-acting injectables, due to the XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union.\nOncology products achieved operational sales growth of 9.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by share gains in all regions and continued market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued strong share gains, market growth, and increased penetration from new launches. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued market share gains from the ongoing launch. Additionally, sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 16.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nCardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 2.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) was primarily driven by favorable patient mix and market growth partially offset by share loss.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Companys drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.

Any difference between the net book value of Kenvue attributable to Johnson & Johnson and the market value of the shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock acquired at that date will be recognized by the Company as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations net of any direct and incremental expenses of the exchange offer on the disposal of its Kenvue Common Stock. Upon completion of the exchange offer, and assuming the Company no longer has a controlling financial interest in Kenvue, Kenvues historical results will be shown in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations, and, in subsequent periods, the Company's financial statements will no longer reflect the assets, liabilities, results of operations or cash flows attributable to Kenvue.\nAs of July 2, 2023, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $28.5 billion and had approximately $45.6 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $17.1 billion as compared to the prior year net neutral position. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Companys remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.2 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve (present value) for the talc settlement proposal (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2023, the Company paid approximately $4.3 billion to the U.S. Treasury including $1.5 billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023), $1.4 billion in pre-payments to resolve certain items previously reserved for and under examination in its 2013 through 2016 U.S. IRS audit, and $1.4 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payments for the first six months of fiscal 2023.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Companys Common Stock. As of April 2, 2023, $5.0 billion has been repurchased and the repurchase program was completed.\nDividends\nOn April 18, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on June 6, 2023, to shareholders of record as of May 23, 2023.\nOn July 20, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on September 7, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 28, 2023. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.\nEconomic and Market Factors\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the Inflation Reduction Acts (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssens rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRAs mandatory pricing scheme.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russias invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal second quarter and fiscal six months of 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the fiscal second quarter ending July 2, 2023, and the 2022 fiscal year ending January 1, 2023, the business of the Companys Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Companys consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the fiscal second quarter ending July 2, 2023, and the 2022 fiscal year ending January 1, 2023, the business of the Companys Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Companys consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.\nIn early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March 2022, the Company made the decision to suspend supply of personal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of the products for healthcare purposes.\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey (beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Companys businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Companys patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place. Item 3 - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere has been no material change in the Companys assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. Item 4 - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nInternal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nPart II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to Note 11 included in Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements (unaudited) - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nItem 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\n(c) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock.
