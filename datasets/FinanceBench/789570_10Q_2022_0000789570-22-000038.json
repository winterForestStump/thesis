ORGANIZATION\nOrganization. MGM Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, the Company) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, operates casino resorts and provides online gaming.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company operates domestic casino resorts, which include the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Aria (including Vdara), Bellagio, The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (The Cosmopolitan), MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, and Excalibur. The Company also operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, MGM National Harbor in Prince Georges County, Maryland, MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Empire City in Yonkers, New York, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio, and the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica. Additionally, the Company operates The Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM, and the Company owns and operates Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of the Las Vegas Strip, and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. The Company leases the real estate assets of its domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements, as further discussed in Note 9.\nThe Company has an approximate 56% controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, MGM China), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (MGM Grand Paradise). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, two integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.\nThe Company also has an approximate 98% controlling interest in LeoVegas AB (LeoVegas), a consolidated subsidiary that has global online gaming operations headquartered in Sweden and Malta. Additionally, the Company and its venture partner, Entain plc, each have a 50% ownership interest in BetMGM, LLC (BetMGM), an unconsolidated affiliate, which provides online sports betting and gaming in certain jurisdictions in North America.\nMGP and the VICI Transaction. Prior to the closing of the VICI Transaction (defined below), MGM Growth Properties LLC (MGP) was a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets were owned by and substantially all of its operations were conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (\"MGP OP). MGP had two classes of common shares: Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owned MGPs Class B share, through which it held a controlling interest in MGP as it was entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGPs shares. The Company and MGP each held MGP OP units representing limited partner interests in MGP OP. Immediately prior to the VICI Transaction, the Company owned 41.5% of MGP OP units, and MGP held the remaining 58.5% ownership interest in MGP OP.\nAdditionally, the Company had leased the real estate assets of certain of its domestic properties from MGP OP, as further discussed in Note 14, and the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas from a venture that was 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of MGP OP and 49.9% by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (BREIT, such venture, the VICI BREIT Venture).\nOn April 29, 2022, the Company completed a series of transactions with VICI Properties, Inc.

Gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires. Pursuant to the agreement dated April 19, 2005 between MGM Grand Paradise and SJM Resorts S.A. (\"SJMSA,\" formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period commencing on April 20, 2005 through March 31, 2020. Pursuant to the then-existing Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration foreseen in the law (up to a maximum term of 20 years), the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. In 2019, MGM Grand Paradises subconcession term was extended from March 31, 2020 to June 26, 2022, consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires. On June 23, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise entered into an addendum to its subconcession pursuant to which its gaming subconcession was extended to December 31, 2022 (refer to Note 6 for additional considerations relating to the gaming subconcession). In connection with the extension, MGM Grand Paradise paid the Macau government MOP 47 million (approximately $6 million) and provided a bank guarantee to secure the fulfillment of MGM Grand Paradises existing commitment of labor liabilities upon expiration of its subconcession (refer to Note 10 for discussion on the guarantee). Additionally, MGM Grand Paradise executed an agreement with the Macau government pursuant to which the casino areas of MGM Cotai and MGM Macau will be reverted, free of charge and without any encumbrances, to the Macau government at the end of the extended subconcession period on December 31, 2022. Management anticipates the gaming assets subject to reversion will be assets used in gaming operations, as well as the gaming areas determined in the agreement. Upon reversion, MGM Grand Paradise will cease to have the legal ownership of the gaming assets, and, while management is currently evaluating the effect of the reversion, it expects that it will retain use of such assets if it is able to obtain a gaming concession in the forthcoming public tender.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Macau government disclosed the content of a proposed bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. The new gaming law was approved by the Macau Legislative Assembly on June 21, 2022 and published in the Macau Official Gazette on June 22, 2022. Under the new gaming law, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain exceptional circumstances. The enactment of the new gaming law precedes the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions for which the rules of the public tender were published on July 1, 2022, which outlined the details for the bidding, the qualifications of bidding companies, and the criteria for granting the new gaming concessions. On September 14, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise submitted its bid. The awarding of a new concession contract would permit the operation of games of chance or other games in casinos in Macau, commencing on January 1, 2023.\nCertain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradises ability to game in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM Chinas senior notes and in an event of default under MGM Chinas revolving credit facilities. Management cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain a gaming concession in the public tender; however, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession.\nReportable segments. The Company has three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 13 for additional information about the Companys segments.\nImpact of COVID-19 - Update. As of September 30, 2022, all of the Companys domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the early part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.\nMacau is currently operating under a dynamic zero COVID-19 policy, as is mainland China. The Companys properties in Macau were open during the first half of 2022, however, gaming operations were temporarily suspended on July 11, 2022 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Macau and resumed on July 23, 2022, subject to certain continuing health safeguards. On October 30, 2022, a COVID-19 case was identified as connected to MGM Cotai. All guests and staff were isolated until November 1, 2022 and all gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations were suspended with limited operations expected to resume beginning November 3, 2022. More broadly, electronic applications for individual and group travel visas to Macau resumed on November 1, 2022, however, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau and mainland China remain in place, including COVID-19 testing and certain quarantine requirements, which have significantly impacted visitation to the Companys Macau properties. Although gaming operations in Macau have resumed and certain restrictions on visa applications have been lifted, protective and operational measures have had a negative effect on MGM Chinas operations. The extent and timing of further closures of MGM Chinas properties, limitations of operations, or whether further travel restrictions to or from Macau will be implemented is uncertain if there is an increase or continued spread of COVID-19.\nNOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Companys 2021 annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Companys interim financial statements. The results for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\nPrinciples of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entitys equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.\nManagement has determined that the venture (the Bellagio BREIT Venture) that is 5% owned by a subsidiary of the Company and 95% owned by a subsidiary of BREIT is a VIE because the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entitys economic performance. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture because the Company does not have power to direct the activities that could potentially be significant to the venture as BREIT, as the managing member, has such power; accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The Companys maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $57 million as of September 30, 2022, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Companys guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of September 30, 2022, as further discussed in Note 10.\nFor entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest based upon the terms of the respective entities ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company generally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in ASC 810. For entities over which the Company does not have significant influence, such as VICI OP, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.\nProperty and equipment. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued $83 million and $36 million, respectively, for purchases of property and equipment within accounts payable.\nFair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Companys accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Companys accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:\nLevel 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;\nLevel 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 7; and\nLevel 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions. See Note 3.\nFair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825, such as LeoVegas (prior to consolidation), and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value, such as VICI OP. The fair value of these investments was $423 million and $66 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is reflected within Other long-term assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other, net in the statements of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss on its equity investments of $20 million and $28 million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a net unrealized loss on its equity investments of $48 million and a net unrealized gain on its equity investments of $39 million, respectively.\nRestricted cash. Restricted cash reflects cash held in an escrow account related to the reverse termination fee that was contractually required to be prefunded for The Cosmopolitan acquisition and was reflected as Restricted Cash on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. Restricted Cash and Cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets equal Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2021.\nAccounts receivable. As of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the loss reserve on accounts receivable was $113 million and $128 million, respectively.\nReclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation.\nRevenue recognition. Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (casino front money) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided, such as advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within Other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:\nOutstanding Chip Liability Loyalty Program Customer Advances and Other\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nBalance at January 1 $ 176,219 $ 212,671 $ 144,465 $ 139,756 $ 640,001 $ 382,287\nBalance at September 30 156,560 177,066 175,716 142,969 747,505 662,096\nIncrease / (decrease) $ (19,659) $ (35,605) $ 31,251 $ 3,213 $ 107,504 $ 279,809\nThe September 30, 2022 balances exclude liabilities related to assets held for sale. See Note 3.\nRevenue by source. The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 13.\nLeases. The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.\nThe Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement, the right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Companys triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Companys leases, such as its ground subleases and equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Companys triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Companys option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Companys leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.\nRefer to Note 9 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee. Refer to Note 14 for discussion of the master lease with MGP.\nThe Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements. Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenants good or service. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, lease revenues from third-party tenants include $19 million and $52 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $30 million and $85 million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, lease revenues from third-party tenants include $13 million and $29 million recorded within food and beverage revenue, respectively, and $22 million and $58 million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues within the consolidated statements of operations.\nShare repurchases. Shares repurchased pursuant to the Companys share repurchase plans are retired upon purchase. The cost of the repurchases in excess of the aggregate par value of the shares reduces capital in excess of par value, to the extent available, with any residual cost applied against retained earnings.\nNOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nLeoVegas acquisition. On May 2, 2022, the Company commenced a public offer to the shareholders of LeoVegas to tender 100% of the shares at a price of SEK 61 in cash per share. On September 7, 2022, the Company completed its tender offer and acquired 65% of the outstanding shares of LeoVegas and, at the completion of an extended acceptance period on September 22, 2022, acquired an additional 2% of outstanding shares, for an aggregate cash tender price of $370 million. During the tender offer period, the Company had acquired 31% of outstanding shares in open market purchases that had an acquisition-date fair value of approximately $172 million. As the Companys previous 31% ownership interest was accounted for at fair value, no gain or loss was recorded upon consolidation. The remaining outstanding shares, with a fair value of approximately $11 million based upon the tender price, will be settled by the Company in cash in connection with squeeze-out proceedings. The acquisition provides the Company an opportunity to create a scaled global online gaming business.\nThe Company recognized 100% of the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of LeoVegas at fair value at the date of the acquisition. The fair value of the acquired equity interests of LeoVegas was determined by the tender price and equaled $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was\nallocated to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists and technology, which are finite-lived intangibles that are amortized over each of their estimated useful lives of five years. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of LeoVegas in excess of identifiable assets as well as expected synergies and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to Corporate and other. The allocation of fair value is preliminary as of September 30, 2022 and is primarily open for the valuation of the acquired intangible assets and for income tax impacts, and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition.\nThe following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 93,407\nReceivables and other current assets 36,872\nTechnology 126,162\nTrademarks 166,356\nCustomer lists 140,843\nGoodwill 238,040\nOther long-term assets 19,181\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities (118,302)\nDebt (104,439)\nOther long-term liabilities (39,564)\nNoncontrolling interests (2,861)\n$ 555,695\nThe operating results for LeoVegas are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. LeoVegass net revenue for the period from September 7, 2022 through September 30, 2022 was $31 million and operating loss and net loss were $3 million and $4 million, respectively.\nThe Cosmopolitan acquisition. On May 17, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests in the entities that own the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. The acquisition expands the Companys customer base and provides a greater depth of choices and experiences for guests in Las Vegas.\nThe Company recognized 100% of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and customer lists, which is amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill, which is deductible for tax purposes, is primarily attributable to the profitability of The Cosmopolitan in excess of identifiable assets as well as expected synergies. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Companys Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment. As of September 30, 2022, the purchase price allocation is preliminary, however, the Company does not expect material changes to the value of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed.\nThe following table sets forth the preliminary purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 80,670\nReceivables and other current assets 94,354\nProperty and equipment 120,912\nTrademarks 130,000\nCustomer lists 95,000\nGoodwill 1,289,468\nOperating lease right-of-use-assets, net 3,404,894\nOther long-term assets 23,709\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities (145,136)\nOperating lease liabilities (3,401,815)\nOther long-term liabilities (1,570)\n$ 1,690,486\nThe operating results for The Cosmopolitan are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. The Cosmopolitans net revenue for the period from May 17, 2022 through September 30, 2022 was $465 million and operating income and net income were each $57 million.\nCityCenter acquisition. On September 27, 2021, the Company acquired Infinity Worlds 50% ownership interest in CityCenter for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 50% ownership interest, which was accounted for under the equity method. Through the acquisition, the Company obtained 100% of the equity interests and therefore consolidated CityCenter as of September 27, 2021. The fair value of the equity interests was determined by the transaction price and equaled $4.25 billion. The carrying value of the Company's equity method investment was less than its share of the fair value of CityCenter at the acquisition date, resulting in a net gain of $1.6 billion upon consolidation, which was recognized as \"Gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net\" on the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn September 28, 2021, the Company sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leases back the real property. The Company classified the real estate assets as held for sale as of the acquisition date and accordingly measured the real estate assets at fair value less costs to sell, as reflected in the table below. See Note 9 for discussion of the lease.\nThe Company recognized 100% of the assets and liabilities of CityCenter at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs. The fair value of the acquired indefinite-lived trademarks was determined using methodologies under the relief from royalty method based on significant inputs that were not observable. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of CityCenter in excess of identifiable assets, of which approximately 50% of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Companys Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.\nThe following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 335,396\nReceivables and other current assets 106,417\nProperty and equipment - real estate assets held for sale 3,888,431\nProperty and equipment 323,093\nTrademarks 180,000\nGoodwill 1,397,338\nOther long-term assets 13,923\nAccounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other current liabilities (201,093)\nDebt (1,729,451)\nOther long-term liabilities (64,054)\n$ 4,250,000\nUnaudited pro forma information - CityCenter and The Cosmopolitan acquisitions. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the Company has been prepared assuming the Companys acquisition of its controlling interest of CityCenter had occurred as of January 1, 2020 and the acquisition of The Cosmopolitan had occurred as of January 1, 2021. The pro forma information excludes the gain on consolidation of CityCenter and does not reflect transactions that occurred subsequent to acquisition, such as the Aria real estate sale-leaseback transaction or the repayment of CityCenters assumed debt. The unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of the indicated date. Pro forma results of operations for the LeoVegas acquisition have not been included because it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 3,416,072 $ 3,208,590 $ 9,958,088 $ 7,762,826\nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International (576,830) 226,231 1,203,246 37,454\nVICI Transaction. On April 29, 2022, VICI acquired MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction. MGP Class A shareholders received 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and the Company received 1.366 units of VICI OP in exchange for each MGP OP unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP redeemed the majority of the Companys VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with the Company retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP that had a fair value of approximately $375 million. MGPs Class B share that was held by the Company was cancelled. Accordingly, the Company no longer holds a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions. Further, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI as discussed in Note 9. The lease between the Company and VICI BREIT Venture for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas remained unchanged.\nIn connection with the transactions, the Company recognized a $2.3 billion gain recorded within Gain on REIT transactions, net. The gain reflects the fair value of consideration received of $4.8 billion plus the carrying amount of noncontrolling interest immediately prior to the transactions of $3.2 billion less the carrying value of the assets and liabilities and accumulated comprehensive income derecognized of $5.7 billion.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities derecognized are as follows (in thousands):\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,387\nIncome tax receivable 5,486\nPrepaid expenses and other 128\nProperty and equipment, net 9,250,519\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 817,901\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net 236,255\nOther long-term assets, net 3,991\nTotal assets $ 10,339,667\nAccounts payable $ 1,136\nAccrued interest on long-term debt 68,150\nOther accrued liabilities 4,057\nDeferred income taxes, net 1,284\nLong-term debt, net 4,259,473\nOperating lease liabilities 336,689\nTotal liabilities $ 4,670,789\nThe Mirage. On December 13, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI will be amended to remove The Mirage and to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of regulatory approvals. The closing condition that the VICI Transaction is consummated or terminated was resolved upon the closing of such transaction and, accordingly, the asset group is classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2022.\nGold Strike Tunica. On June 9, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments.

As described in Note 1, the enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions to be awarded in the upcoming public tender. As a result, the Company determined that the existing MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and new gaming concession, if obtained, would be two separate units of account.\nFurther, as the material changes in the legal and regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradises gaming subconcession, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred under ASC 360 in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The Company compared the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to its carrying value and determined that the undiscounted cash flows significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore, no impairment was indicated.\nAdditionally, in June 2022, the Company reassessed the useful life of the existing gaming subconcession intangible asset and determined that, given the new gaming law and the resulting changes described above, the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession, which ends in January 2038, and that the useful life should be revised to align with the cessation of the subconcession rights that will occur at the end of the contractual term of the existing gaming subconcession, which ends on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession will be recognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life.\nNOTE 7 - LONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 December 31,\n(In thousands)\nMGP OP senior secured credit facility $ - $ 50,000\nMGM China first revolving credit facility 1,242,070 360,414\nMGM China second revolving credit facility 12,739 -\nLeoVegas revolving credit facility 39,206 -\nLeoVegas senior notes, due 2023\n62,570 -\n7.75% senior notes, due 2022\n- 1,000,000\n6% senior notes, due 2023\n1,250,000 1,250,000\n5.625% MGP OP senior notes, due 2024\n- 1,050,000\n5.375% MGM China senior notes, due 2024\n750,000 750,000\n6.75% senior notes, due 2025\n750,000 750,000\n5.75% senior notes, due 2025\n675,000 675,000\n4.625% MGP OP senior notes, due 2025\n- 800,000\n5.25% MGM China senior notes, due 2025\n500,000 500,000\n5.875% MGM China senior notes, due 2026\n750,000 750,000\n4.5% MGP OP senior notes, due 2026\n- 500,000\n4.625% senior notes, due 2026\n400,000 400,000\n5.75% MGP OP senior notes, due 2027\n- 750,000\n5.5% senior notes, due 2027\n675,000 675,000\n4.75% MGM China senior notes, due 2027\n750,000 750,000\n4.5% MGP OP senior notes, due 2028\n- 350,000\n4.75% senior notes, due 2028\n750,000 750,000\n3.875% MGP OP senior notes, due 2029\n- 750,000\n7% debentures, due 2036\n552 552\n8,607,137 12,860,966\nLess: Premiums, discounts, and unamortized debt issuance costs, net (45,878) (90,169)\n8,561,259 12,770,797\nLess: Current portion (1,351,422) (1,000,000)\n$ 7,209,837 $ 11,770,797\nSenior secured credit facility.

The public ownership of MGPs Class A shares was recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2022, the Company completed the VICI Transaction, which resulted in the deconsolidation of MGP, including its investment in the VICI BREIT Venture. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on the VICI Transaction. As part of the transactions, the Company entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the master lease with VICI.\nBellagio BREIT Venture\nThe Company has a 5% ownership interest in Bellagio BREIT Venture, which owns the real estate assets of Bellagio and leases such assets to a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 9 for further information related to the Bellagio lease.\nItem 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the other disclosures contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, which were included in our Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 25, 2022. The results of operations for the periods reflected herein are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for future periods. MGM Resorts International together with its subsidiaries may be referred to as we, us or our. MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as MGM China. MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its subsidiaries is referred to as MGP.\nDescription of our business\nOur primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We also offer online gaming and sports betting through LeoVegas, our consolidated subsidiary, as well as through BetMGM, our unconsolidated affiliate.\nImpact of COVID-19 - Update\nAs of September 30, 2022, all of our domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the early part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.\nMacau is currently operating under a dynamic zero COVID-19 policy, as is mainland China. Our properties in Macau were open during the first half of 2022, however, gaming operations were temporarily suspended on July 11, 2022 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Macau and resumed on July 23, 2022, subject to certain continuing health safeguards. On October 30, 2022, a COVID-19 case was identified as connected to MGM Cotai. All guests and staff were isolated until November 1, 2022 and all gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations were suspended with limited operations expected to resume beginning November 3, 2022. More broadly, electronic applications for individual and group travel visas to Macau resumed on November 1, 2022, however, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau and mainland China remain in place, including COVID-19 testing and certain quarantine requirements, which have significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. Although gaming operations in Macau have resumed and certain restrictions on visa applications have been lifted, protective and operational measures have had a negative effect on MGM Chinas operations. The extent and timing of further closures of MGM Chinas properties, limitations of operations, or whether further travel restrictions to or from Macau will be implemented is uncertain if there is an increase or continued spread of COVID-19.\nOther Developments\nIn April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction in a stock-for-stock transaction. In connection with the transaction, VICI OP redeemed the majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with us retaining an approximate 1% ownership interest in VICI OP. MGPs Class B share that was previously held by us was cancelled. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling interest in MGP and deconsolidated MGP upon the closing of the transactions. In connection with the VICI Transaction, we entered into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. See Note 3 and Note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\nIn May 2022, we acquired the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, plus working capital adjustments for a total purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion. Additionally, we entered into a lease\nagreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. See Note 3 and Note 9 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction and lease, respectively.\nIn June 2022, the Macau government enacted a new gaming law that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions to be awarded in the upcoming public tender, such as limiting the term of concessions to a maximum of 10 years.\nAs a result, we reassessed the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset and reduced the useful life to align with the contractual term of the subconcession, which expires on December 31, 2022, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations. See Note 1 and Note 6 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nCertain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradises ability to game in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM Chinas senior notes and in an event of default under MGM Chinas revolving credit facilities. Management cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain a gaming concession in the public tender; however, management submitted its bid on September 14, 2022, and believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession. For a description of certain risks applicable to MGM Grand Paradises subconcession and related matters, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 under the heading Risk Factors- Risks Related to Our Macau Operations.\nIn September 2022, we acquired LeoVegas through a tender offer at a cash price of SEK 61 per share, for a total fair value of equity interests acquired of approximately $556 million, inclusive of cash settlement of equity awards. See Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of this transaction.\nPending Transactions\nOn December 13, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI will be amended to remove The Mirage and reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. See Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction.\nOn June 9, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of Gold Strike Tunica to CNE for cash consideration of $450 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI will be amended to remove Gold Strike Tunica and reflect a $40 million reduction in annual cash rent. See Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the transaction.\nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); win or hold percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and\nHotel revenue indicators (for Las Vegas Strip Resorts) - hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (ADR, a price indicator); and revenue per available room (REVPAR, a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 as a result of property closures due to the pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.\nAdditional key performance indicators at MGM China are:\nGaming revenue indicators - MGM China utilizes turnover, which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the pandemic could cause volatility in MGM Chinas hold percentages.\nResults of Operations\nSummary Operating Results\nCertain of our properties or portions thereof were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 during the comparative periods in 2021 as follows:\nPark MGM and Mandalay Bays hotel tower operations were closed midweek and full week hotel operations resumed March 3, 2021.\nThe Mirages hotel tower operations were closed midweek, with the entire property closed midweek starting January 4, 2021, and re-opened on March 3, 2021.\nMGM Springfields hotel was closed and partial hotel operations resumed with midweek closures on March 5, 2021. Full hotel operations resumed on December 13, 2021.\nMGM Grand Detroits hotel tower operations were closed and resumed on February 9, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated operating results:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 3,416,072 $ 2,707,539 $ 9,535,269 $ 6,623,248\nOperating income (1,045,971) 1,892,782 1,441,268 1,909,852\nNet income (loss) (1,061,087) 1,337,936 526,745 1,092,302\nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International (576,830) 1,350,433 1,189,091 1,123,357\nConsolidated net revenues were $3.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.7 billion in the prior year quarter, an increase of 26%. The current quarter benefited from the inclusion of the net revenues of The Cosmopolitan and a full quarter of net revenues related to Aria as well as from comparative increases in business volume and travel activity at our domestic resorts, primarily at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts. At MGM China, the current and prior year quarters were significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau due to the impact of COVID-19 with the current quarter being negatively affected by property closures and more significantly impacted by restrictions compared to the prior quarter. As a result, net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts increased 67%, Regional Operations increased 5%, and MGM China decreased 70% compared to the prior year quarter.\nConsolidated operating loss was $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to operating income of $1.9 billion in the prior year quarter. The current quarter reflected an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for the Aria, VICI, and The Cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in September 2021, April 2022, and May 2022, respectively, and a decrease in income from unconsolidated affiliates, partially offset by the increase in net revenues, as discussed above. In addition, the prior year quarter benefited from the gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net of $1.6 billion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.1 billion compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to the change in useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.\nConsolidated net revenues were $9.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $6.6 billion in the prior year period, an increase of 44%. The current year period benefited from the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan and a full year of net revenues related to Aria. The current year period was initially negatively affected by a decrease in business volume and travel due to the spread of the omicron variant in the early part of the period, however, business\nvolumes subsequently improved at our domestic resorts with a significant increase primarily at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts over the prior year period, which was negatively affected by midweek property and hotel closures, lower travel activity, and operational restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At MGM China, the current and prior year period were significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau with the current year period being negatively affected by property closures and more significantly impacted by restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year period. As a result, net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts increased 108%, Regional Operations increased 13%, and MGM China decreased 44% compared to the prior year period.\nConsolidated operating income was $1.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $1.9 billion in the prior year period. The current year period benefited from a $2.3 billion gain related to the VICI Transaction and the increase in net revenues, as discussed above, partially offset by an increase in rent expense recorded within general and administrative expense for the Aria, VICI, and The Cosmopolitan leases, which commenced in September 2021, April 2022, and May 2022, respectively, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, and a decrease in income from unconsolidated affiliates. The prior year period benefited from the gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net of $1.6 billion. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $1.2 billion compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the change in useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.\nNet Revenues by Segment\nThe following table presents a detail by segment of net revenues:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nCasino $ 575,868 $ 422,541 $ 1,549,690 $ 1,008,108\nRooms 735,653 403,010 1,916,949 846,053\nFood and beverage 599,846 308,522 1,544,886 614,572\nEntertainment, retail and other 389,655 246,894 1,089,565 461,766\n2,301,022 1,380,967 6,101,090 2,930,499\nRegional Operations\nCasino 721,192 719,630 2,159,010 2,024,149\nRooms 84,754 70,766 211,780 160,269\nFood and beverage 115,432 92,148 312,621 211,661\nEntertainment, retail and other, and reimbursed costs 52,557 42,579 141,022 96,677\n973,935 925,123 2,824,433 2,492,756\nMGM China\nCasino 70,325 252,445 422,476 784,984\nRooms 6,989 16,683 30,472 47,585\nFood and beverage 7,703 15,808 36,084 50,323\nEntertainment, retail and other 2,469 4,123 9,841 13,152\n87,486 289,059 498,873 896,044\nReportable segment net revenues 3,362,443 2,595,149 9,424,396 6,319,299\nCorporate and other 53,629 112,390 110,873 303,949\n$ 3,416,072 $ 2,707,539 $ 9,535,269 $ 6,623,248\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue was $576 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $423 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 36%, due primarily to the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan and a full quarter of casino revenue related to Aria, and increases in business volume and travel activity in the current year quarter.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue was $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $1.0 billion in the prior year period, an increase of 54%, due primarily to the inclusion of The Cosmopolitan and a full year of casino revenue related to Aria and was negatively affected by a decrease in business volume and travel due to the spread of the omicron variant in the early part of the current year period; however, business volumes subsequently improved with a significant increase over the prior year period, which was negatively affected by midweek property and hotel closures, lower travel activity, and operational restrictions due to the pandemic.\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n(Dollars in millions)\nTable games drop $ 1,604 $ 917 $ 4,235 $ 2,223\nTable games win $ 389 $ 251 $ 1,015 $ 552\nTable games win % 24.3 % 27.4 % 24.0 % 24.8 %\nSlots handle $ 6,193 $ 3,863 $ 16,144 $ 9,804\nSlots win $ 577 $ 369 $ 1,502 $ 932\nSlots win % 9.3 % 9.6 % 9.3 % 9.5 %\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts rooms revenue was $736 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $403 million in the prior year quarter, an increase of 83%.

Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.\nIn April 2022, we completed the VICI Transaction pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of MGP were derecognized, which included MGP OPs investment in VICI BREIT Venture. Accordingly, we no longer have an ownership interest in VICI BREIT Venture.\nNon-operating Results\nInterest Expense\nGross interest expense was $125 million and $200 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $458 million and $599 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease from the respective prior year periods is due primarily to a decrease in debt outstanding as a result of the derecognition of MGP OPs senior notes in connection with the deconsolidation of MGP, partially offset by an increase in the debt outstanding under MGM Chinas revolving credit facilities. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion on long-term debt and see Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.\nOther, net\nOther expense, net was $14 million and $49 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current year and prior year quarters included a net unrealized loss on equity instruments of $20 million and $48 million, respectively.\nOther expense, net was $23 million for the for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to other income, net of $70 million in the prior year period. The current year period included a $28 million net unrealized loss on equity instruments. The prior year period included a $39 million net unrealized gain on equity instruments, and a $33 million gain on the MGP OPs unhedged interest rate swaps.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was a benefit of 10.6% on loss before income taxes and a provision of 43.8% on income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively, compared to a provision of 17.4% and 16.9% on income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.\nThe effective rate for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit and an increase in state deferred tax liabilities resulting from the issuance of income tax regulations by the state of New Jersey, partially offset by a decrease in Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from an extension of the exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax to the end of the year.\nThe effective rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit and the increase in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the New Jersey income tax regulation issuance, partially offset by the decrease in Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from the extension of the exemption from the Macau 12% complementary tax to the end of the year, the impact of the reassessment of the useful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession, and the impact of a decrease in state deferred tax liabilities as a result of the VICI Transaction.\nThe effective rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were favorably impacted by tax expense recorded on the \"Gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net\", at an approximately 12% effective rate due to the presence of goodwill, and were unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit, partially offset by the release of tax reserves in conjunction with the closure of a New Jersey state income tax audit.\nReportable segment GAAP measure\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, and also excludes gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenters sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminated in consolidation. We manage capital allocation, tax planning, stock compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\nNon-GAAP measures\nSame-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is Adjusted Property EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of acquired operating segments from the date of acquisition through the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, we have excluded the Adjusted Property EBITDAR of The Cosmopolitan for periods subsequent to its acquisition on May 17, 2022 and Aria for periods subsequent to its acquisition on September 27, 2021 in Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR for the periods indicated.\nSame-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a non-GAAP measure and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because management believes this measure is useful in providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the results of our operations for operating segments that were consolidated for the full period presented to assist users of the financial statements in reviewing operating performance over time. Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to our reportable segment GAAP measure or net income, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR may not be defined in the same manner by all companies and, as a result, may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies, and such differences may be material. A reconciliation of our reportable segment Adjusted Property EBITDAR GAAP measure to Same-Store Adjusted Property EBITDAR is included herein.\nAdjusted EBITDAR is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases, gain related to CityCenters sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR information is a non-GAAP measure that is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current\nresults and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, management excludes rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases. Management believes excluding rent expense related to triple-net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing the Company, as well as comparing the Companys results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple-net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, an indicator of our performance, considered in isolation, or construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles because this measure is not presented on a GAAP basis and excludes certain expenses, including the rent expense related to our triple-net operating leases and ground leases, and is provided for the limited purposes discussed herein. In addition, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDAR is included herein.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International to Adjusted EBITDAR:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet income (loss) attributable to MGM Resorts International $ (576,830) $ 1,350,433 $ 1,189,091 $ 1,123,357\nPlus: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (484,257) (12,497) (662,346) (31,055)\nNet income (loss) (1,061,087) 1,337,936 526,745 1,092,302\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes (125,367) 282,135 411,131 222,263\nIncome (loss) before income taxes (1,186,454) 1,620,071 937,876 1,314,565\nNon-operating (income) expense:\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized 125,172 200,049 457,822 598,116\nNon-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates 995 23,421 22,248 67,473\nOther, net 14,316 49,241 23,322 (70,302)\n140,483 272,711 503,392 595,287\nOperating income (loss) (1,045,971) 1,892,782 1,441,268 1,909,852\nPreopening and start-up expenses 396 1,547 1,372 1,642\nProperty transactions, net (11,639) 3,677 23,704 842\nDepreciation and amortization 1,405,520 279,403 2,060,413 853,579\nGain on REIT transactions, net - - (2,277,747) -\nGain on consolidation of CityCenter, net - (1,562,329) - (1,562,329)\nTriple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense 604,193 191,622 1,350,099 570,851\nGain related to sale of Harmon land - unconsolidated affiliate - - - (49,755)\nIncome from unconsolidated affiliates related to real estate ventures (2,690) (41,669) (59,162) (125,007)\nAdjusted EBITDAR $ 949,809 $ 2,539,947\nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of September 30, 2022, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that owns and operates MGM Springfield), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including LeoVegas, MGM China, and each of their respective subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.\nThe guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantors obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.\nThe summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Prior to the VICI Transaction, certain of our guarantor subsidiaries owned MGP OP units which were accounted for under the equity method and is reflected as such within the summarized financial information. Certain of our guarantor subsidiaries accounted for the MGP master lease as an operating lease with the operating lease liabilities, operating lease ROU assets, and related rent expense reflected within the summarized financial information. Additionally, assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale associated with The Mirage and Gold Strike Tunica are included within current assets and other current liabilities, respectively, within the summarized financial information.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 December 31,\nBalance Sheet (In thousands)\nCurrent assets $ 7,377,165 $ 5,663,171\nInvestment in MGP OP - 2,284,222\nMGP master lease right-of-use asset, net - 6,629,140\nOther long-term assets 28,644,695 17,025,933\nMGP master lease operating lease liabilities - current - 154,287\nOther current liabilities 5,217,031 2,752,185\nIntercompany accounts due to non-guarantor subsidiaries - 16,697\nMGP master lease operating lease liabilities - noncurrent - 7,083,505\nOther long-term liabilities 28,162,590 18,472,138\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nIncome Statement (In thousands)\nNet revenues $ 7,660,122\nMGP master lease rent expense 429,065\nOperating income 3,648,032\nIncome from continuing operations 1,235,266\nNet income 602,549\nNet income attributable to MGM Resorts International 602,549\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $887 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations discussed within the Results of Operations section above, and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments.\nInvesting activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.\nCash provided by investing activities was $1.6 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI Transaction, which were partially offset by cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, net of cash acquired, cash paid of $280 million in connection with the LeoVegas tender offer, net of cash acquired, cash paid of $183 million to acquire shares of LeoVegas in the open market during the tender offer period, payments of $457 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributions of $200 million to our unconsolidated affiliate, BetMGM. In comparison, in the prior year period we received $3.9 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate of Aria and Vdara, which were partially offset by our payments of $1.8 billion to acquire CityCenter, net of cash acquired, $322 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributions of $150 million to BetMGM.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe made capital expenditures of $457 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, of which $23 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate and other entities of $434 million primarily relate to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.\nWe made capital expenditures of $322 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, of which $58 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $44 million primarily related to construction of the Emerald Tower project at MGM Cotai and $14 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $264 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $63 million, as further discussed below, distributed $208 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $2.4 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $1.5 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $240 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds received of $793 million from the issuance of MGPs Class A shares.\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $63 million, which consisted of the repayment of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, partially offset by net draws of $40 million on MGP OPs revolving credit facility, net borrowings of $884 million on MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility and borrowings of $13 million on MGM Chinas second revolving credit facility. MGM Chinas borrowings were made to fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.5 billion, which consisted of the repayment of the $1.7 billion outstanding on CityCenters credit facility in full, which was assumed in the acquisition, using cash on hand, net repayments of $503 million on MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility, and repayments of $10 million on MGP OPs revolving credit facility. These repayments were partially offset by MGM Chinas March 2021 issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 at an issue price of 99.97%. The net proceeds from MGM Chinas 4.75% senior notes due 2027 issuance were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China first revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nDividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners, and Share Repurchases\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.4 billion of our common stock pursuant to our February 2020 $3.0 billion and March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plans. In connection with those repurchases, the February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. The remaining availability under the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $827 million as of September 30, 2022.\nIn March, June, and September 2022 and 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $3 million and $4 million paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nMGP OP paid the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\n$283 million of distributions paid in 2022, of which we received $117 million and MGP received $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders; and\n$406 million of distributions paid in 2021, of which we received $185 million and MGP received $221 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.3 billion, of which MGM China held $875 million. In addition to our cash and cash equivalent balance, we have an approximate 56% interest in MGM China.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $8.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $1.2 billion outstanding under MGM Chinas first revolving credit facility, $13 million outstanding under MGM Chinas second revolving credit facility, and $39 million outstanding under LeoVegass revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility. We have $1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve months, which we expect to repay with cash on hand.\nDue to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2022, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity in May 2024.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $220 million to $230 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately $445 million to $460 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.\nWe are also required, as of September 30, 2022, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.9 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments,\ninsurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 9 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations and Note 1 and Note 3 for pending transactions.\nWe have planned capital expenditures expected over the remainder of the year of approximately $355 million to $365 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and approximately $10 million to $20 million at MGM China, including approximately $7 million of show production costs related to the development of entertainment at the MGM Cotai theater. We additionally have planned contributions to BetMGM over the remainder of the year of approximately $25 million.\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our March 2022 $2.0 billion share repurchase plan. Subsequent to the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $31.76 per share for an aggregate amount of $183 million. Repurchased shares were retired.\nOn November 2, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.0025 per share. The dividend will be payable on December 15, 2022 to holders of record on December 9, 2022. Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAs previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant economic disruption both globally and in the United States, and impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows since the onset of the pandemic, which continued in 2022. As a result of the widespread distribution of vaccines and the removal of operational restrictions, we have seen economic recovery in some of the market segments in which we operate, as shown in our Summary Operating Results. However, some areas continue to experience renewed outbreaks and surges in infection rates, resulting in the imposition of operational restrictions, such as the temporary re-closure of our properties in Macau in July 2022 due to an increase in the number of local COVID-19 cases. As a result, our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to reversal of these trends or other continuing negative effects caused by the pandemic. We cannot predict the degree, or duration, to which our operations will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects could be material.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nA complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates since year end, other than discussed below.\nLong-lived assets valuation - MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession\nIn connection with the enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 that provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration and has material changes to the rights and obligation provided for under new gaming concessions to be awarded in the upcoming public tender, we determined that MGM Grand Paradises existing gaming subconcession and new gaming concession, if obtained, would be two separate units of account.\nFurther, as the material changes in the legal and regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradises existing gaming subconcession, we concluded that a trigger event had occurred in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The gaming subconcession is an entity-wide asset of MGM China as the benefit of the right to conduct gaming provided by the gaming subconcession is shared by each of MGM Chinas casino resorts and the cash flows generated by the gaming subconcession cannot be separated from the casino resorts in which gaming operations are conducted. We determined that the real estate is the primary asset of the asset group as the real estate component generates a significant portion of the entitys cash flows through gaming operations conducted at its casino resorts. Accordingly, cash flows were projected over the remaining useful life of the real estate, including cash flows from gaming operations as we believe we will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession in future public tenders. The estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group significantly exceeded the carrying value; accordingly, no impairment was indicated.\nThere are several estimates inherent in evaluating the gaming subconcession asset for impairment. The determination of the asset group to be tested for recoverability and the primary asset of the asset group are matters of judgment as it is dependent on corporate structure, the legal and regulatory environment in which the entity operates, and the level of interdependency between assets used in revenue generating activities. The determination of the primary asset directly affects the period over which cash flows are forecasted when performing the recoverability test. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of undiscounted cash flows used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of land concession renewals and successfully obtaining a gaming concession in connection with future public tenders.\nAdditionally, we reassessed the useful life of the existing gaming subconcession intangible asset and, given the new gaming law and the resulting changes described above, we determined that the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession that ends in January 2038, and that the new useful life is consistent with the remaining contractual term of the existing gaming subconcession, which ends on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession will be recognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life, thereby accelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations.\nThe determination of the unit of account and useful life of the gaming subconcession are based upon facts and circumstances as of a point in time and may change as such conditions develop, evolve, or change. We have determined the unit of account and useful life based upon the final gaming law and its enactment in June 2022 as the enactment reflects the finalization of the changes in legal form and rights and obligations related to gaming concessions in Macau.\nGoodwill valuation\nWe continue to conclude, as of September 30, 2022, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our reporting units exceed their carrying value and, accordingly, an interim quantitative impairment review of goodwill was not triggered. However, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. For MGM Macau, if the property continues to face closures, if its operations do not recover from the impacts of COVID-19 in the forecasted time period, if we are not successful in obtaining a gaming concession in connection with future public tenders, or if our obligations under the new gaming concession exceed those forecasted, it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. For Empire City, if we are not successful in obtaining a commercial gaming license, if the costs to obtain the license, develop, and construct a full-scale commercial gaming facility increase from our current expectations, or if we do not realize our forecasted cash flows for the expanded facility, it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge. In addition, the determination of multiples, control premiums, and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions and entity performance.\nMarket Risk\nIn addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.\nAs of September 30, 2022, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 16% of our total borrowings. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates:\nDebt maturing in Fair Value September 30, 2022\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total\n(In millions)\nFixed-rate $ - $ 1,250 $ 750 $ 1,925 $ 1,150 $ 2,175 $ 7,250 $ 6,466\nAverage interest rate N/A 6.0 % 5.4 % 6.0 % 5.4 % 5.0 % 5.5 %\nVariable rate $ 102 $ - $ 1,255 $ - $ - $ - $ 1,357 $ 1,357\nAverage interest rate 5.7 % N/A 5.2 % N/A N/A N/A 5.3 %\nIn addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. As of September 30, 2022, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as anticipates, intends, plans, seeks, believes, estimates, expects, will, may and similar references to future periods.
