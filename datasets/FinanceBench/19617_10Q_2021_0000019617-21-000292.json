(JPMorgan Chase or the Firm), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firms business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\nThe unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated.\nThese unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K.\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to be a reduction to the carrying value of certain tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firms effective income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firms results of operations on a managed basis.\nConsolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\nRefer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chases accounting policies regarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.\nNote 2 - Fair value measurement\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firms valuation methodologies for assets, liabilities and lending-related commitments measured at fair value and the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities reported at fair value as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nFair value hierarchy Derivative\nnetting\nadjustments(f)\nMarch 31, 2021 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total fair value\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements $ -

Net realizable value is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (transaction costs). Transaction costs for the Firms physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firms physical commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further\ndiscussion of the Firms hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n(c)Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold but not yet purchased (short positions).\n(d)Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and other funds, were $678 million and $670 million, respectively. Included in these balances at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, were trading assets of $55 million and $52 million, respectively, and other assets of $623 million and $618 million, respectively.\n(e)At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included within loans were $20.1 billion and $15.1 billion, respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $6.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $11.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.\n(f)As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level 3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n(g)The prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.\nLevel 3 valuations\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firms valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\nThe following table presents the Firms primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.\nIn the Firms view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firms estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nLevel 3 inputs(a)\nMarch 31, 2021\nProduct/Instrument Fair value\n(in millions)\nPrincipal valuation technique Unobservable inputs(g)\nRange of input values Average(i)\nResidential mortgage-backed securities and loans(b)\n$ 991 Discounted cash flows Yield 0% - 15% 6%\nPrepayment speed 0% - 48% 9%\nConditional default rate 0% - 30% 10%\nLoss severity 0% - 109% 8%\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities and loans(c)\n516 Market comparables Price $0 - $100 $86\nCorporate debt securities 370 Market comparables Price $10 - $120 $96\nLoans(d)\n1,579 Market comparables Price $5 - $111 $82\nAsset-backed securities 54 Market comparables Price $2 - $96 $61\nNet interest rate derivatives 130 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 7 bps - 723 bps 132 bps\nInterest rate spread volatility 11 bps - 23 bps 15 bps\nInterest rate correlation (65)% - 99% 36%\nIR-FX correlation (35)% - 50% (1)%\n19 Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 0% - 30% 8%\nNet credit derivatives (41) Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 37% - 65% 49%\nCredit spread 1 bps - 1,501 bps 396 bps\nRecovery rate 0% - 70% 47%\nConditional default rate 2% - 100% 37%\nLoss severity 100% 100%\n37 Market comparables Price $0 - $115 $69\nNet foreign exchange derivatives (424) Option pricing IR-FX correlation (40)% - 65% 17%\n(115) Discounted cash flows Prepayment speed 9% 9%\nNet equity derivatives (3,834) Option pricing Forward equity price(h)\n61% - 130% 99%\nEquity volatility 4% - 146% 33%\nEquity correlation 12% - 99% 55%\nEquity-FX correlation (79)% - 60% (26)%\nEquity-IR correlation 15% - 50% 28%\nNet commodity derivatives (911) Option pricing OIl Commodity Forward $478 / MT - $553 / MT $516 / MT\nForward power price $13 / MWH - $55 / MWH $34 / MWH\nCommodity volatility 2% - 70% 36%\nCommodity correlation (50)% - 95% 23%\nMSRs 4,470 Discounted cash flows Refer to Note 14\nLong-term debt, short-term borrowings, and deposits(e)\n27,985 Option pricing Interest rate volatility 7 bps - 723 bps 132 bps\nInterest rate correlation (65)% - 99% 36%\nIR-FX correlation (35)% - 50% (1)%\nEquity correlation 12% - 99% 55%\nEquity-FX correlation (79)% - 60% (26)%\nEquity-IR correlation 15% - 50% 28%\n906 Discounted cash flows Credit correlation 37% - 65% 49%\nOther level 3 assets and liabilities, net(f)\n1,385\n(a)The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the characteristics of the instruments can differ.\n(b)Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $397 million, nonagency securities of $32 million and non-trading loans of $562 million.\n(c)Comprises nonagency securities of $2 million, trading loans of $41 million and non-trading loans of $473 million.\n(d)Comprises trading loans of $791 million and non-trading loans of $788 million.\n(e)Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f)Includes equity securities of $968 million, including $280 million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.\n(g)Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed assuming a par value of $100.\n(h)Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i)Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.\nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firms positions.\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair\nvalue measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firms risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.\nFair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2021\n(in millions) Fair value at\nJanuary 1,\n2021 Total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) Transfers into\nlevel 3 Transfers (out of) level 3 Fair value at\nMarch 31, 2021 Change in unrealized gains/(losses) related\nto financial instruments held at March 31, 2021\nPurchases(f)\nSales Settlements(g)\nAssets:(a)\nTrading assets:\nDebt instruments:\nMortgage-backed securities:\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies\n$ 449 $ 23 $ 6 $ (48) $ (33) $ -

Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 94 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nThree months ended March 31, 2021\nLevel 3 assets were $17.4 billion at March 31, 2021, reflecting an increase of $952 million from December 31, 2020.\nThe increase for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was predominantly driven by a $1.2 billion increase in MSRs. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.\nRefer to the sections below for additional information.\nTransfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2020, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following:\n$2.1 billion of total debt and equity instruments, predominantly trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability.\n$1.0 billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $1.7 billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2020, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2.\nAll transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.\nGains and losses\nThe following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects of the Firms risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables on pages 90-93 for further information on these instruments.\nThree months ended March 31, 2021\n$984 million of net gains on assets, driven by MSRs reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.\n$528 million of net gains on liabilities, largely driven by market movements in long-term debt.\nThree months ended March 31, 2020\n$1.2 billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables due to market movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs.\n$4.6 billion of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by market movements in long-term debt.\nCredit and funding adjustments - derivatives\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firms own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firms own credit quality over time.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA $ 240 $ (924)\nDerivatives FVA\n105 (1,021)\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information about both credit and funding adjustments, as well as information about valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nThe following tables present the assets and liabilities held as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, for which nonrecurring fair value adjustments were recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, by major product category and fair value hierarchy.\nFair value hierarchy Total fair value\nMarch 31, 2021 (in millions) Level 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nLoans $ - $ 1,857\n$ 303 (b)\n$ 2,160\nOther assets(a)\n- 12 370 382\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ 1,869 $ 673 $ 2,542\nAccounts payable and other liabilities - - 14\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ - $ 14 $ 14\nFair value hierarchy Total fair value\nMarch 31, 2020 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nLoans $ - $ 2,336\n$ 559 $ 2,895\nOther assets - 11 334\nTotal assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ 2,347 $ 893 $ 3,240\nAccounts payable and other liabilities - - 775\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis $ - $ - $ 775 $ 775\n(a)Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $370 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2021, $316 million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.\n(b)Of the $303 million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2021, $137 million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information from brokers price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firms experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 45% with a weighted average of 26%.\nNonrecurring fair value changes\nThe following table presents the total change in value of assets and liabilities for which fair value adjustments have been recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, related to assets and liabilities held at those dates.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nLoans $ (33)\n$ (267)\nOther assets(a)\n(169)\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n(3)\n(775)\nTotal nonrecurring fair value gains/(losses)\n$ (34) $ (1,211)\n(a)Included $6 million and $(154) million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of net gains/(losses) as a result of the measurement alternative.\nRefer to Note 11 for further information about the measurement of collateral-dependent loans.\nEquity securities without readily determinable fair values\nThe Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such changes recognized in other income.\nIn its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if deemed necessary to arrive at the Firms estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firms valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\nThree months ended\nMarch 31\nAs of or for the period ended,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nOther assets\nCarrying value(a)\n$ 2,302 $ 2,560\nUpward carrying value changes(b)\n7 9\nDownward carrying value changes/impairment(c)\n(1) (162)\n(a)The carrying value as of December 31, 2020 was $2.4 billion.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions currently and will be convertible into Visa Class A common shares upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares is 1.6228 at March 31, 2021, and may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters.\nAdditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value\nThe following table presents, by fair value hierarchy classification, the carrying values and estimated fair values at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nEstimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy\n(in billions) Carrying\nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated\nfair value Carrying\nvalue Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated\nfair value\nFinancial assets\nCash and due from banks $ 25.4 $ 25.4 $ - $ - $ 25.4 $ 24.9 $ 24.9 $ - $ - $ 24.9\nDeposits with banks 685.7 685.7 - - 685.7 502.7 502.7 - - 502.7\nAccrued interest and accounts receivable\n113.6 - 113.5 0.1 113.6 89.4 - 89.3 0.1 89.4\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements\n4.9 - 4.9 - 4.9 58.3 - 58.3 - 58.3\nSecurities borrowed\n113.4 - 113.2 - 113.2 107.7 - 107.7 - 107.7\nInvestment securities, held-to-maturity\n217.5 74.5 143.2 - 217.7 201.8 53.2 152.3 - 205.5\nLoans, net of allowance for loan losses(a)\n937.5 - 206.7 752.7 959.4 940.1 - 210.9 755.6 966.5\nOther 95.0 - 93.2 1.9 95.1 81.8 - 80.0 1.9 81.9\nFinancial liabilities\nDeposits $ 2,264.0 $ - $ 2,264.0 $ - $ 2,264.0 $ 2,129.8 $ - $ 2,128.9 $ - $ 2,128.9\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements\n106.2 - 106.2 - 106.2 59.5 - 59.5 - 59.5\nShort-term borrowings\n35.0 - 35.0 - 35.0 28.3 - 28.3 - 28.3\nAccounts payable and other liabilities\n205.9 - 201.6 3.9 205.5 186.6 - 181.9 4.3 186.2\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs\n15.5 - 15.5 - 15.5 17.5 - 17.6 - 17.6\nLong-term debt\n203.7 - 207.8 3.3 211.1 204.8 - 209.2 3.2 212.4\n(a)Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs, including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral. Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loans allowance for loan losses, which represents the loans expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads, market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying value.\nThe majority of the Firms lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nEstimated fair value hierarchy Estimated fair value hierarchy\n(in billions) Carrying value(a) (b)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value Carrying value(a) (b)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total estimated fair value\nWholesale lending-related commitments\n$ 2.4 $ - $ - $ 2.8 $ 2.8 $ 2.2 $ - $ - $ 2.1 $ 2.1\n(a)Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.\n(b)Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases, the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to page 173 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation of lending-related commitments.\nNote 3 - Fair value option\nThe fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.\nThe Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair value basis.\nThe Firms election of fair value includes the following instruments:\nLoans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments\nCertain securities financing agreements\nOwned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument\nStructured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued as part of client-driven activities\nCertain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIBs consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are carried at fair value\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in the table.\nThree months ended March 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions) Principal transactions All other income Total changes in fair\nvalue recorded (e)\nPrincipal transactions All other income Total changes in fair value recorded (e)\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements\n$ (12) $ - $ (12) $ 543 $ - $ 543\nSecurities borrowed (70) - (70) 226 - 226\nTrading assets:\nDebt and equity instruments, excluding loans\n621 - 621 (2,438) (1) (c)\n(2,439)\nLoans reported as trading assets:\nChanges in instrument-specific credit risk 204 -\n204 (656) -\n(656)\nOther changes in fair value (1) -\n(1) 1 -\nLoans:\nChanges in instrument-specific credit risk 237 1 (c)\n238 64 (23) (c)\nOther changes in fair value(a)\n(250) 340 (c)\n90 268 741 (c)\n1,009\nOther assets 19 (19) (d)\n- 85 (17) (d)\nDeposits(a)\n167 - 167 (103) - (103)\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements\n34 - 34 (259) - (259)\nShort-term borrowings(a)\n(122) - (122) 1,720 - 1,720\nTrading liabilities - - - - - -\nOther liabilities 1 - 1 (35) - (35)\nLong-term debt(a)(b)\n1,247 (5) (c)(d)\n1,242 4,181 5 (c)\n4,186\n(a)Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue were $(2) million for both the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.\n(c)Reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n(d)Reported in other income.\n(e)Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments recorded in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information regarding interest income and interest expense.\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, for loans, long-term debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions) Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding Contractual principal outstanding Fair value Fair value over/(under) contractual principal outstanding\nLoans\nNonaccrual loans\nLoans reported as trading assets $ 3,102 $ 426 $ (2,676) $ 3,386 $ 555 $ (2,831)\nLoans 1,388 1,144 (244) 1,867 1,507 (360)\nSubtotal 4,490 1,570 (2,920) 5,253 2,062 (3,191)\n90 or more days past due and government guaranteed\nLoans(a)\n355 340 (15) 328 317 (11)\nAll other performing loans(b)\nLoans reported as trading assets 8,758 7,477 (1,281) 7,917 6,439 (1,478)\nLoans 49,143 49,283 140 42,022 42,650 628\nSubtotal 57,901 56,760 (1,141) 49,939 49,089 (850)\nTotal loans $ 62,746 $ 58,670 $ (4,076) $ 55,520 $ 51,468 $ (4,052)\nLong-term debt\nPrincipal-protected debt $ 39,625 (d)\n$ 36,943 $ (2,682) $ 40,560 (d)\n$ 40,526 $ (34)\nNonprincipal-protected debt(c)\nNA 38,750 NA NA 36,291 NA\nTotal long-term debt NA $ 75,693 NA NA $ 76,817 NA\nLong-term beneficial interests\nNonprincipal-protected debt(c)\nNA $ 193 NA NA $ 41 NA\nTotal long-term beneficial interests NA $ 193 NA NA $ 41 NA\n(a)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.\n(b)There were no performing loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(c)Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(d)Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firms next call date.\nAt March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $20.9 billion and $18.1 billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $75 million and $(39) million, respectively.

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firms use of and accounting policies regarding derivative instruments.\nThe Firms disclosures are based on the accounting treatment and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firms derivatives are designated in hedge\naccounting relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (specified risk management positions) as well as derivatives used in the Firms market-making businesses or for other purposes.\nThe following table outlines the Firms primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or disclosure category.\nType of Derivative Use of Derivative Designation and disclosure Affected\nsegment or unit 10-Q page reference\nManage specifically identified risk exposures in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\nInterest rate\nHedge fixed rate assets and liabilities Fair value hedge Corporate\n106-107\nInterest rate\nHedge floating-rate assets and liabilities Cash flow hedge Corporate\nForeign exchange\nHedge foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities\nFair value hedge\nCorporate\n106-107\nForeign exchange\nHedge foreign currency-denominated forecasted revenue and expense\nCash flow hedge Corporate\nForeign exchange\nHedge the value of the Firms investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities\nNet investment hedge\nCorporate\nCommodity\nHedge commodity inventory Fair value hedge\nCIB, AWM\n106-107\nManage specifically identified risk exposures not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships:\nInterest rate\nManage the risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs\nSpecified risk management CCB 109\nCredit\nManage the credit risk associated with wholesale lending exposures\nSpecified risk management\nCIB 109\nInterest rate and foreign exchange\nManage the risk associated with certain other specified assets and liabilities Specified risk management\nCorporate\nMarket-making derivatives and other activities:\nVarious\nMarket-making and related risk management Market-making and other\nCIB 109\nVarious\nOther derivatives Market-making and other\nCIB, AWM, Corporate 109\nNotional amount of derivative contracts\nThe following table summarizes the notional amount of free-standing derivative contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nNotional amounts(b)\n(in billions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nInterest rate contracts\nSwaps\n$ 23,774 $ 20,986\nFutures and forwards\n5,186 3,057\nWritten options\n3,412 3,375\nPurchased options\n3,707 3,675\nTotal interest rate contracts\n36,079 31,093\nCredit derivatives(a)\n1,335 1,201\nForeign exchange contracts\nCross-currency swaps\n3,850 3,924\nSpot, futures and forwards\n7,647 6,871\nWritten options\n837 830\nPurchased options\n827 825\nTotal foreign exchange contracts\n13,161 12,450\nEquity contracts\nSwaps\n496 448\nFutures and forwards\n138 140\nWritten options\n695 676\nPurchased options\n638 621\nTotal equity contracts 1,967 1,885\nCommodity contracts\nSwaps\n178 138\nSpot, futures and forwards\n199 198\nWritten options\n142 124\nPurchased options\n126 105\nTotal commodity contracts\n645 565\nTotal derivative notional amounts\n$ 53,187 $ 47,194\n(a)Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page 110 for more information on volumes and types of credit derivative contracts.\n(b)Represents the sum of gross long and gross short third-party notional derivative contracts.\nWhile the notional amounts disclosed above give an indication of the volume of the Firms derivatives activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed, in the Firms view, the possible losses that could arise from such transactions.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash). These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firms derivative instruments, but are not eligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure amount. Liquid securities represent high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and\ncollateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from the tables below.\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions) Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables Gross derivative receivables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative receivables\nU.S. GAAP nettable derivative receivables\nInterest rate contracts:\nOver-the-counter (OTC) $ 288,187 $ (265,270) $ 22,917 $ 367,056 $ (337,451) $ 29,605\nOTC-cleared 17,627 (17,498) 129 18,340 (17,919) 421\nExchange-traded(a)\n334 (305) 29 554 (395) 159\nTotal interest rate contracts 306,148 (283,073) 23,075 385,950 (355,765) 30,185\nCredit contracts:\nOTC 9,229 (8,460) 769 9,052 (8,514) 538\nOTC-cleared 4,758 (4,704) 54 4,326 (4,309) 17\nTotal credit contracts 13,987 (13,164) 823 13,378 (12,823) 555\nForeign exchange contracts:\nOTC 181,701 (170,672) 11,029 201,349 (189,655) 11,694\nOTC-cleared 891 (841) 50 834 (819) 15\nExchange-traded(a)\n18 (2) 16 35 (5) 30\nTotal foreign exchange contracts 182,610 (171,515) 11,095 202,218 (190,479) 11,739\nEquity contracts:\nOTC 30,396 (23,963) 6,433 34,030 (27,374) 6,656\nExchange-traded(a)\n30,633 (29,862) 771 28,294 (26,751) 1,543\nTotal equity contracts 61,029 (53,825) 7,204 62,324 (54,125) 8,199\nCommodity contracts:\nOTC 11,725 (6,789) 4,936 10,924 (7,901) 3,023\nOTC-cleared 36 (36) - 20 (20) -\nExchange-traded(a)\n8,378 (8,196) 182 6,833 (6,811) 22\nTotal commodity contracts 20,139 (15,021) 5,118 17,777 (14,732) 3,045\nDerivative receivables with appropriate legal opinion\n583,913 (536,598) 47,315 (d)\n681,647 (627,924) 53,723 (d)\nDerivative receivables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained\n25,804 25,804 25,907 25,907\nTotal derivative receivables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets\n$ 609,717 $ 73,119 $ 707,554 $ 79,630\nCollateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c)\n(13,958) (14,806)\nNet amounts\n$ 59,161 $ 64,824\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions) Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables Gross derivative payables Amounts netted on the Consolidated balance sheets Net derivative payables\nU.S. GAAP nettable derivative payables\nInterest rate contracts:\nOTC $ 257,384 $ (249,248) $ 8,136 $ 331,854 $ (320,780) $ 11,074\nOTC-cleared 19,914 (18,884) 1,030 19,710 (19,494) 216\nExchange-traded(a)\n322 (310) 12 358 (341) 17\nTotal interest rate contracts 277,620 (268,442) 9,178 351,922 (340,615) 11,307\nCredit contracts:\nOTC 9,841 (8,412) 1,429 10,671 (9,141) 1,530\nOTC-cleared 4,321 (4,292) 29 4,075 (4,056) 19\nTotal credit contracts 14,162 (12,704) 1,458 14,746 (13,197) 1,549\nForeign exchange contracts:\nOTC 180,571 (167,627) 12,944 210,803 (193,672) 17,131\nOTC-cleared 857 (841) 16 836 (819) 17\nExchange-traded(a)\n13 - 13 34 (2) 32\nTotal foreign exchange contracts 181,441 (168,468) 12,973 211,673 (194,493) 17,180\nEquity contracts:\nOTC 33,285 (27,282) 6,003 35,330 (28,763) 6,567\nExchange-traded(a)\n37,132 (29,861) 7,271 34,491 (26,752) 7,739\nTotal equity contracts 70,417 (57,143) 13,274 69,821 (55,515) 14,306\nCommodity contracts:\nOTC 10,338 (7,253) 3,085 10,365 (7,544) 2,821\nOTC-cleared 53 (53) - 32 (32) -\nExchange-traded(a)\n8,571 (8,194) 377 7,391 (6,868) 523\nTotal commodity contracts 18,962 (15,500) 3,462 17,788 (14,444) 3,344\nDerivative payables with appropriate legal opinion\n562,602 (522,257) 40,345 (d)\n665,950 (618,264) 47,686 (d)\nDerivative payables where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained\n20,095 20,095 22,937 22,937\nTotal derivative payables recognized on the Consolidated balance sheets\n$ 582,697 $ 60,440 $ 688,887 $ 70,623\nCollateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets(b)(c)\n(9,193) (11,964)\nNet amounts\n$ 51,247 $ 58,659\n(a)Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.\n(b)Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained.

Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances with that counterparty.\n(c)Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.\n(d)Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $74.6 billion and $88.0 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $60.2 billion and $78.4 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.\nLiquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\nRefer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features related to the Firms derivative contracts.\nThe following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\n(in millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nAggregate fair value of net derivative payables\n$ 21,562 $ 26,945 (a)\nCollateral posted 21,279 26,289\n(a)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.\nLiquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions) Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade Single-notch downgrade Two-notch downgrade\nAmount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade(a)\n$ 178 $ 1,448 $ 119 $ 1,243\nAmount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade(b)\n127 833 153 1,682 (c)\n(a)Includes the additional collateral to be posted for initial margin.\n(b)Amounts represent fair values of derivative payables, and do not reflect collateral posted.\n(c)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nDerivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nImpact of derivatives on the Consolidated statements of income\nThe following tables provide information related to gains and losses recorded on derivatives based on their hedge accounting designation or purpose.\nFair value hedge gains and losses\nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in fair value hedge accounting relationships, as well as pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives and the related hedged items for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm includes gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the related hedged item.\nGains/(losses) recorded in income Income statement impact of\nexcluded components(e)\nOCI impact\nThree months ended March 31, 2021\n(in millions) Derivatives Hedged items Income statement impact Amortization approach Changes in fair value Derivatives - Gains/(losses) recorded in OCI(f)\nContract type\nInterest rate(a)(b)\n$ (5,121) $ 5,446 $ 325 $ - $ 436 $ -\nForeign exchange(c)\n(729) 747 18 (78) 18 (37)\nCommodity(d)\n(1,261) 1,288 27 - 12 -\nTotal $ (7,111) $ 7,481 $ 370 $ (78) $ 466 $ (37)\nGains/(losses) recorded in income Income statement impact of\nexcluded components(e)\nOCI impact\nThree months ended March 31, 2020\n(in millions) Derivatives Hedged items Income statement impact Amortization approach Changes in fair value Derivatives - Gains/(losses) recorded in OCI(f)\nContract type\nInterest rate(a)(b)\n$ 4,087 $ (3,788) $ 299 $ - $ 214 $ -\nForeign exchange(c)\n576 (488) 88 (179) 88 115\nCommodity(d)\n1,528 (1,482) 46 - 49 -\nTotal $ 6,191 $ (5,758) $ 433 $ (179) $ 351 $ 115\n(a)Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)) interest rate risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.\n(b)Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.\n(c)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal transactions revenue and net interest income.\n(d)Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.\n(e)The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.\n(f)Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative.\nAs of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.\nCarrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b)\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items:\nMarch 31, 2021\n(in millions) Active hedging relationships Discontinued hedging relationships(d)(e)\nTotal\nAssets\nInvestment securities - AFS $ 87,720 (c)\n$ 502 $ 633 $ 1,135\nLiabilities\nLong-term debt $ 176,622 $ (2,741) $ 9,190 $ 6,449\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 747 - (2) (2)\nCarrying amount of the hedged items(a)(b)\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount of hedged items:\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in millions) Active hedging relationships Discontinued hedging relationships(d)(e)\nTotal\nAssets\nInvestment securities - AFS $ 139,684 (c)\n$ 3,572 $ 847 $ 4,419\nLiabilities\nLong-term debt $ 177,611 $ 3,194 $ 11,473 $ 14,667\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 746 - (3) (3)\n(a)Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $16.1 billion and $11.5 billion at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.\n(b)Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $15.5 billion and $14.5 billion, respectively, and for long-term debt is $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively.\n(c)Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.\n(d)Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.\n(e)Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.\nCash flow hedge gains and losses\nThe following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.\nDerivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss)\nThree months ended March 31, 2021\n(in millions) Amounts reclassified\nfrom AOCI to income Amounts recorded\nin OCI Total change\nin OCI for period\nContract type\nInterest rate(a)\n$ 237 $ (2,761) $ (2,998)\nForeign exchange(b)\n27 66 39\nTotal $ 264 $ (2,695) $ (2,959)\nDerivatives gains/(losses) recorded in income and other comprehensive income/(loss)\nThree months ended March 31, 2020\n(in millions) Amounts reclassified\nfrom AOCI to income Amounts recorded\nin OCI Total change\nin OCI for period\nContract type\nInterest rate(a)\n$ (9) $ 3,461 $ 3,470\nForeign exchange(b)\n17 (210) (227)\nTotal $ 8 $ 3,251 $ 3,243\n(a)Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.\n(b)Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense. The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue and compensation expense.\nThe Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOver the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $926 million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI at March 31, 2021, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately nine years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.

At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 97% and 98% rated at least AA+, respectively.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million and $19 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRefer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM securities.\nSelected impacts of investment securities on the Consolidated statements of income\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nRealized gains $ 237 $ 1,095\nRealized losses (223) (862)\nNet investment securities gains\n$ 14 $ 233\nProvision for credit losses $ 16 $ 9\nContractual maturities and yields\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and estimated fair value at March 31, 2021, of JPMorgan Chases investment securities portfolio by contractual maturity.\nBy remaining maturity March 31, 2021 (in millions) Due in one\nyear or less Due after one year through five years Due after five years through 10 years Due after\n10 years(b)\nTotal\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 2,226 $ 5,998 $ 117,531 $ 125,755\nFair value - 2,251 6,283 117,555 126,089\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 1.40 % 1.79 % 2.50 % 2.44 %\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\nAmortized cost $ 4,058 $ 129,668 $ 53,799 $ 7,898 $ 195,423\nFair value 4,088 129,830 52,724 8,142 194,784\nAverage yield(a)\n0.95 % 0.52 % 0.95 % 0.54 % 0.65 %\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities\nAmortized cost $ 33 $ 207 $ 1,152 $ 17,259 $ 18,651\nFair value 33 214 1,219 18,456 19,922\nAverage yield(a)\n4.16 % 4.74 % 4.96 % 4.96 % 4.96 %\nNon-U.S. government debt securities\nAmortized cost $ 7,029 $ 5,581 $ 4,511 $ 3,624 $ 20,745\nFair value 7,038 5,698 4,530 3,607 20,873\nAverage yield(a)\n1.19 % 2.05 % 0.78 % 0.52 % 1.21 %\nCorporate debt securities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 139 $ 71 $ - $ 210\nFair value - 136 74 - 210\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 1.18 % 1.89 % - % 1.42 %\nAsset-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ 1,544 $ 1,995 $ 6,812 $ 7,621 $ 17,972\nFair value 1,545 2,011 6,831 7,677 18,064\nAverage yield(a)\n1.28 % 1.94 % 1.30 % 1.42 % 1.42 %\nTotal available-for-sale securities\nAmortized cost $ 12,664 $ 139,816 $ 72,343 $ 153,933 $ 378,756\nFair value 12,704 140,140 71,661 155,437 379,942\nAverage yield(a)\n1.13 % 0.62 % 1.11 % 2.57 % 1.52 %\nHeld-to-maturity securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 423 $ 11,858 $ 92,851 $ 105,132\nFair value - 423 12,214 93,816 106,453\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 1.12 % 2.36 % 2.93 % 2.86 %\nU.S. Treasury and government agencies\nAmortized cost $ 1,318 $ 42,176 $ 32,613 $ - $ 76,107\nFair value 1,319 42,161 31,065 - 74,545\nAverage yield(a)\n0.17 % 0.66 % 1.18 % - % 0.88 %\nObligations of U.S. states and municipalities\nAmortized cost $ - $ 65 $ 688 $ 11,959 $ 12,712\nFair value - 66 724 12,205 12,995\nAverage yield(a)\n- % 3.23 % 3.76 % 3.77 % 3.77 %\nAsset-backed securities\nAmortized cost $ - $ - $ 11,137 $ 12,458 $ 23,595\nFair value - - 11,192 12,525 23,717\nAverage yield(a)\n- % - % 1.34 % 1.33 % 1.33 %\nTotal held-to-maturity securities\nAmortized cost $ 1,318 $ 42,664 $ 56,296 $ 117,268 $ 217,546\nFair value 1,319 42,650 55,195 118,546 217,710\nAverage yield(a)\n0.17 % 0.67 % 1.49 % 2.84 % 2.05 %\n(a)Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b)Substantially all of the Firms U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10 years or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future prepayments, is approximately 6 years for agency residential MBS, 4 years for agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations and 3 years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\nNote 10 - Securities financing activities\nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firms securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances\noutstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets, and reduces the Net amounts presented.

These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 11 - Loans\nLoan accounting framework\nThe accounting for a loan depends on managements strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., retained)\nLoans held-for-sale\nLoans at fair value\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firms loan portfolio is divided into three portfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each loan class.\nConsumer, excluding\ncredit card Credit card Wholesale(c)(d)\nResidential real estate(a)\nAuto and other(b)\nCredit card loans Secured by real estate\nCommercial and industrial\nOther(e)\n(a)Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and Corporate.\n(b)Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c)Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d)The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\n(e)Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.\nThe following tables summarize the Firms loan balances by portfolio segment.\nMarch 31, 2021 Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(a)(b)\n(in millions)\nRetained $ 302,392 $ 131,772 $ 514,478 $ 948,642\nHeld-for-sale 1,232 721 9,945 11,898\nAt fair value 21,284 - 29,483 50,767\nTotal $ 324,908 $ 132,493 $ 553,906 $ 1,011,307\nDecember 31, 2020 Consumer, excluding credit card Credit card Wholesale Total(a)(b)\n(in millions)\nRetained $ 302,127 $ 143,432 $ 514,947 $ 960,506\nHeld-for-sale 1,305 784 5,784 7,873\nAt fair value 15,147 - 29,327 44,474\nTotal $ 318,579 $ 144,216 $ 550,058 $ 1,012,853\n(a)Excludes $2.9 billion of accrued interest receivables at both March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm wrote off accrued interest receivables of $13 million and $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)Loans (other than those for which the fair value option has been elected) are presented net of unamortized discounts and premiums and net deferred loan fees or costs. These amounts were not material as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nThe following table provides information about the carrying value of retained loans purchased, sold and reclassified to held-for-sale during the periods indicated.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.\n(c)Excludes purchases of retained loans of $7.0 billion and $3.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in accordance with the Firms standards.\nGains and losses on sales of loans\nNet gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was $132 million, of which $135 million related to loans. Net losses on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was $(913) million, of which $(142) million related to loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit losses.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firms COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because:\nthey represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firms regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or\nthe Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs.\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.\nConsumer, excluding credit card loan portfolio\nConsumer loans, excluding credit card loans, consist primarily of scored residential mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto and business banking loans, with a focus on serving the prime consumer credit market. The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.\n(in millions) March 31,\n2021 December 31,\nResidential real estate $ 219,173 $ 225,302\nAuto and other(a)\n83,219 76,825\nTotal retained loans $ 302,392 $ 302,127\n(a)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $23.4 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking under the PPP.\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans.

These amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.\n(d)Includes loans purchased based on the year in which they were originated.\n(e)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nApproximately 35% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans. The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firms allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential real estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average data) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)\n$ 5,247 $ 5,313\n90 or more days past due and government guaranteed(e)\n30 33\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(f)(g)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 $ 19 $ 10\nLess than 660 14 18\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 105 72\nLess than 660 46 65\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 1,482 2,365\nLess than 660 286 435\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660 204,165 208,457\nLess than 660 11,267 12,072\nNo FICO/LTV available 1,713 1,732\nU.S. government-guaranteed\n76 76\nTotal retained loans\n$ 219,173 $ 225,302\nWeighted average LTV ratio(f)(h)\n53 % 54 %\nWeighted average FICO(g)(h)\n764 763\nGeographic region(i)\nCalifornia $ 70,787 $ 73,444\nNew York 32,042 32,287\nFlorida 14,086 13,981\nTexas 13,320 13,773\nIllinois 12,350 13,130\nColorado 8,085 8,235\nWashington 7,687 7,917\nNew Jersey 6,934 7,227\nMassachusetts 5,715 5,784\nConnecticut 5,012 5,024\nAll other(j)\n43,155 44,500\nTotal retained loans\n$ 219,173 $ 225,302\n(a)Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (Chapter 7 loans) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2021, approximately 7% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $45 million and $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(d)Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which are considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.\n(e)These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies. Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, these balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were no loans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n(f)Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value. Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n(g)Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrowers most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at least a quarterly basis.\n(h)Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n(i)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.\n(j)At both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $76 million. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented based upon the government guarantee.\nLoan modifications\nModifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $251 million and $142 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.\nNature and extent of modifications\nThe Firms proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement.\nThe following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firms loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\nThree months ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nNumber of loans approved for a trial modification\n1,401 1,996\nNumber of loans permanently modified\n1,714 1,481\nConcession granted:(a)\nInterest rate reduction\n72 % 79 %\nTerm or payment extension\n40 81\nPrincipal and/or interest deferred\n31 11\nPrincipal forgiveness 4 4\nOther(b)\n51 55\n(a)Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on permanent modifications.\n(b)Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the definition of a TDR.\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults\nThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions, and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.\n(in millions, except weighted-average data) Three months ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions - before TDR\n4.57 % 5.20 %\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans with interest rate reductions - after TDR\n2.91 3.48\nWeighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions - before TDR\n24 22\nWeighted-average remaining contractual term (in years) of loans with term or payment extensions - after TDR\n39 39\nCharge-offs recognized upon permanent modification\n$ - $ -\nPrincipal deferred\n12 5\nPrincipal forgiven\n1 2\nBalance of loans that redefaulted within one year of permanent modification(a)\n$ 24 $ 70\n(a)Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes two contractual payments past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve months may not be representative of ultimate redefault levels.\nAt March 31, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently modified in TDRs were six years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).\nActive and suspended foreclosure\nAt March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $802 million and $846 million, respectively, that were not included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay recognition of foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\nAuto and other\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained auto and other consumer loans.\nMarch 31, 2021\n(in millions, except ratios) Term Loans by origination year Revolving loans\n2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Prior to 2017 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent\n$ 17,719 (b)\n$ 39,161 (b)\n$ 11,405 $ 6,349 $ 3,706 $ 2,045 $ 2,369 $ 149 $ 82,903\n30-119 days past due 32 50 65 47 31 33 21 12 291\n120 or more days past due - - - 1 1 1 12 10 25\nTotal retained loans $ 17,751 $ 39,211 $ 11,470 $ 6,397 $ 3,738 $ 2,079 $ 2,402 $ 171 $ 83,219\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.18% 0.13% 0.57 % 0.75 % 0.86 % 1.64 % 1.37 % 12.87 % 0.38 %\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in millions, except ratios) Term Loans by origination year Revolving loans\n2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Prior to 2016 Within the revolving period Converted to term loans Total\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent\n$ 46,169 (c)\n$ 12,829 $ 7,367 $ 4,521 $ 2,058 $ 742 $ 2,517 $ 158 $ 76,361\n30-119 days past due 97 107 77 53 42 23 30 17 446\n120 or more days past due - - - 1 - 1 8 8 18\nTotal retained loans $ 46,266 $ 12,936 $ 7,444 $ 4,575 $ 2,100 $ 766 $ 2,555 $ 183 $ 76,825\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.21% 0.83 % 1.03 % 1.18 % 2.00 % 3.13 % 1.49 % 13.66 % 0.60 %\n(a)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.\n(b)At March 31, 2021, included $8.7 billion of loans originated in 2021 and $14.7 billion of loans originated in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.\n(c)At December 31, 2020, included $19.2 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.\nNonaccrual and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained auto and other consumer loans.\n(in millions, except ratios) Total Auto and other\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)\n135 151\nGeographic region(d)\nCalifornia $ 13,514 $ 12,302\nNew York 10,551 8,824\nTexas 8,746 8,235\nFlorida 5,117 4,668\nIllinois 4,003 3,768\nNew Jersey 2,895 2,646\nArizona 2,619 2,465\nOhio 2,293 2,163\nColorado 2,021 1,910\nPennsylvania 2,004 1,924\nAll other 29,456 27,920\nTotal retained loans $ 83,219 $ 76,825\n(a)There were no loans that were 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n(b)Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.\n(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\n(d)The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.\nLoan modifications\nCertain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nThe impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. Additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were not material.\nCredit card loan portfolio\nThe credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans.\nRefer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the credit card loan portfolio, including credit quality indicators.\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)\nMarch 31, 2021\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans(b)\nTotal\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\nand still accruing\n$ 128,749 $ 1,178 $ 129,927\n30-89 days past due and still accruing\n714 73 787\n90 or more days past due and still accruing\n1,018 40 1,058\nTotal retained loans $ 130,481 $ 1,291 $ 131,772\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n1.33 % 8.75 % 1.40 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.78 3.10 0.80\n(in millions, except ratios)\nDecember 31, 2020\nWithin the revolving period Converted to term loans(b)\nTotal\nLoan delinquency(a)\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due\nand still accruing\n$ 139,783 $ 1,239 $ 141,022\n30-89 days past due and still accruing\n997 94 1,091\n90 or more days past due and still accruing\n1,277 42 1,319\nTotal retained loans $ 142,057 $ 1,375 $ 143,432\nLoan delinquency ratios\n% of 30+ days past due to total retained loans\n1.60 % 9.89 % 1.68 %\n% of 90+ days past due to total retained loans\n0.90 3.05 0.92\n(a)At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.\n(b)Represents TDRs.\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia $ 19,266 $ 20,921\nTexas 13,628 14,544\nNew York 10,935 11,919\nFlorida 8,889 9,562\nIllinois 7,329 8,006\nNew Jersey 5,420 5,927\nOhio 4,254 4,673\nPennsylvania 4,036 4,476\nColorado 3,798 4,092\nMichigan 3,245 3,553\nAll other 50,972 55,759\nTotal retained loans $ 131,772 $ 143,432\nPercentage of portfolio based on carrying value with estimated refreshed FICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660 86.3 % 85.9 %\nLess than 660 13.5 13.9\nNo FICO available 0.2 0.2\n(a)The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan balances at March 31, 2021.\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer one of a number of loan modification programs granting concessions to credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firms long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\nIf the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firms standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrowers line of credit.\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults\nThe following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except\nweighted-average data) Three months ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nBalance of new TDRs(a)\n$ 143 $ 277\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans - before TDR\n17.74 % 18.82 %\nWeighted-average interest rate of loans - after TDR\n5.23 4.02\nBalance of loans that redefaulted within one year of modification(b)\n$ 19 $ 36\n(a)Represents the outstanding balance prior to modification.\n(b)Represents loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification. The amounts presented represent the balance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in which they defaulted.\nFor credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firms standard charge-off policy.\nWholesale loan portfolio\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients, to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the\ninternal risk rating assigned to each loan.

This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.\n(c)Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nLoan modifications\nCertain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of TDRs was $1.2 billion and $954 million as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $428 million and $76 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The new TDRs for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were primarily from Commercial and Industrial loan modifications that included extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets\nin partial satisfaction of the loan. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 12 - Allowance for credit losses\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses and the related accounting policies.\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology.

Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty rates.\n(b)The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(c)At March 31, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $21.8 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $674.4 billion and $681.4 billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $39.6 billion and $24.0 billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n(d)Excludes the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM securities was $94 million and $19 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance\nThe allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2021 decreased when compared to December 31, 2020, consisting of:\na $4.5 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios, and in the residential real estate portfolio primarily due to the continued improvement in the HPI expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio run-off, and\na $716 million net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic scenarios\nWhile the economy is showing signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's allowance estimate at a speed and to degrees not experienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increased the reliance on management judgment. These challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates remain, albeit to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of historical experience on which the Firms models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately address these economic circumstances.\nFurther, despite the improvement in the economy, uncertainties remain, including the health of underlying labor markets, vaccine efficacy against new virus strains, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm continued to place significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions outlined below, resulting in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates rising above eight percent in 2021 and remaining at approximately six percent into the second quarter of 2022 with U.S. GDP returning to pre-pandemic levels in 1Q22.\nThe Firms central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at March 31, 2021\n2Q21 4Q21 2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n5.7 % 4.8 % 4.3 %\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 0.2 % 2.7 % 4.3 %\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21 4Q21 2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)\n6.8 % 5.7 % 5.1 %\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 12/31/2019 (1.9) % 0.6 % 2.0 %\n(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.\nNote 13 - Variable interest entities\nRefer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chases accounting policies regarding consolidation of VIEs.\nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment.\nLine of Business Transaction Type Activity Form 10-Q page references\nCCB Credit card securitization trusts Securitization of originated credit card receivables 137\nMortgage securitization trusts Servicing and securitization of both originated and purchased residential mortgages 137-139\nCIB Mortgage and other securitization trusts Securitization of both originated and purchased residential and commercial mortgages, and other consumer loans 137-139\nMulti-seller conduits Assist clients in accessing the financial markets in a cost-efficient manner and structures transactions to meet investor needs 139\nMunicipal bond vehicles Financing of municipal bond investments 139\nThe Firm also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 140-141 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs\nCredit card securitizations\nAs a result of the Firms continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Refer to the table on page 140 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\nFirm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nRefer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of JPMorgan Chase's involvement with credit card securitizations and Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment relating to such trusts.\nThe following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firms only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The\nFirms maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.

The retained interests in prime residential mortgages consisted of $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $33 million and $41 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $2.0 billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $753 million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at both March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nResidential mortgage\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. Refer to the table on page 140 of this Note for more information on the consolidated residential mortgage securitizations, and the table on the previous page of this Note for further information on interests held in nonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations\nCIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts.

The Firm held $10.9 billion and $13.5 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firms investments reflect the Firms funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $14.2 billion and $12.2 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nMunicipal bond vehicles\nMunicipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (TOB) trusts allow institutions to finance their municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party, refer to page 141 of this Note for further information.\nThe Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions.\nRefer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed description of JPMorgan Chases participation in certain re-securitization transactions, principal involvement with Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, and Municipal bond vehicles.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nAssets Liabilities\nMarch 31, 2021 (in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(c)\nTotal\nassets(d)\nBeneficial interests in\nVIE assets(e)\nOther(f)\nTotal\nliabilities\nVIE program type\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts $ - $ 10,716 $ 133 $ 10,849 $ 4,319 $ 2 $ 4,321\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits 3 19,642 187 19,832 9,030 34 9,064\nMunicipal bond vehicles 1,989 - 4 1,993 1,958 - 1,958\nMortgage securitization entities(a)\n- 1,520 102 1,622 305 102 407\nOther 2 1,631 (b)\n275 1,908 59 101 160\nTotal $ 1,994 $ 33,509 $ 701 $ 36,204 $ 15,671 $ 239 $ 15,910\nAssets Liabilities\nDecember 31, 2020 (in millions) Trading assets Loans Other(c)\nTotal\nassets(d)\nBeneficial interests in\nVIE assets(e)\nOther(f)\nTotal\nliabilities\nVIE program type\nFirm-sponsored credit card trusts $ - $ 11,962 $ 148 $ 12,110 $ 4,943 $ 3 $ 4,946\nFirm-administered multi-seller conduits 2 23,787 188 23,977 10,523 33 10,556\nMunicipal bond vehicles 1,930 - 2 1,932 1,902 - 1,902\nMortgage securitization entities(a)\n- 1,694 94 1,788 210 108 318\nOther 2 176 249 427 - 89 89\nTotal $ 1,934 $ 37,619 $ 681 $ 40,234 $ 17,578 $ 233 $ 17,811\n(a)Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.\n(b)Includes $1.2 billion of purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.\n(c)Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d)The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e)The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest entities. The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $4.7 billion and $5.2 billion at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n(f)Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arms-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\nTax credit vehicles\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $23.1 billion and $23.6 billion, of which $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion was unfunded at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\nCustomer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder.\nIn those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.\nThe Firms maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $6.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, was $10.2 billion and $10.5 billion, respectively.\nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firms accounting policies regarding securitizations.\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firms securitization activities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not consolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nThree months ended March 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions) Residential mortgage(d)\nCommercial and other(e)\nResidential mortgage(d)\nCommercial and other(e)\nPrincipal securitized $ 4,077 $ 1,912 $ 3,064 $ 3,188\nAll cash flows during the period:(a)\nProceeds received from loan sales as financial instruments(b)(c)\n$ 4,234 $ 1,970 $ 3,136 $ 3,273\nServicing fees collected 41 - 62 -\nCash flows received on interests\n183 52 117 29\n(a)Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b)Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d)Represents prime mortgages. Excludes loan securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(e)Includes commercial mortgage and other consumer loans.\nLoans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored\nenterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to\nGinnie Mae guidelines\nIn addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share\na portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firms loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firms sale of certain excess MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nCarrying value of loans sold\n$ 23,147 $ 24,935\nProceeds received from loan sales as cash\n16 9\nProceeds from loan sales as securities(a)(b)\n22,749 24,663\nTotal proceeds received from loan sales(c)\n$ 22,765 $ 24,672\nGains/(losses) on loan sales(d)(e)\n$ 4 $ 4\n(a)Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae that are generally sold shortly after receipt or retained as part of the Firms investment securities portfolio.\n(b)Included in level 2 assets.\n(c)Excludes the value of MSRs retained upon the sale of loans.\n(d)Gains/(losses) on loan sales include the value of MSRs.\n(e)The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\nOptions to repurchase delinquent loans\nIn addition to the Firms obligation to repurchase certain loans due to material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan\npools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firms repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.\nThe following table presents loans the Firm repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firms Consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Substantially all of these loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.\n(in millions) Mar 31,\n2021 Dec 31,\nLoans repurchased or option to repurchase(a)\n$ 1,332 $ 1,413\nReal estate owned\n8 9\nForeclosed government-guaranteed residential mortgage loans(b)\n55 64\n(a)Predominantly all of these amounts relate to loans that have been repurchased from Ginnie Mae loan pools.\n(b)Relates to voluntary repurchases of loans, which are included in accrued interest and accounts receivable.\nLoan delinquencies and liquidation losses\nThe table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing involvement as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nNet liquidation losses\nSecuritized assets 90 days past due Three months ended March 31,\n(in millions) Mar 31,\n2021 Dec 31,\n2020 Mar 31,\n2021 Dec 31,\n2020 2021 2020\nSecuritized loans\nResidential mortgage:\nPrime / Alt-A & option ARMs $ 39,678 $ 41,265 $ 4,414 $ 4,988 $ 12 $ 99\nSubprime 11,602 12,154 2,231 2,406 18 86\nCommercial and other 86,649 92,351 4,753 5,958 21 10\nTotal loans securitized $ 137,929 $ 145,770 $ 11,398 $ 13,352 $ 51 $ 195\nNote 14 - Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights\nRefer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the accounting policies related to goodwill and mortgage servicing rights.\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents goodwill attributed to the business segments.\n(in millions) March 31,\n2021 December 31,\nConsumer & Community Banking $ 31,326 $ 31,311\nCorporate & Investment Bank 7,912 7,913\nCommercial Banking 2,985 2,985\nAsset & Wealth Management 7,020 7,039\nTotal goodwill $ 49,243 $ 49,248\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nBalance at beginning\nof period\n$ 49,248 $ 47,823\nChanges during the period from:\nOther (5) (a)\n(23) (b)\nBalance at March 31, $ 49,243 $ 47,800\n(a)Includes adjustments to goodwill related to the prior period acquisitions of cxLoyalty in CCB and 55ip in AWM during the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on these acquisitions.\n(b)Primarily foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing\nGoodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firms goodwill impairment testing, including the primary method used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units and the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test.\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firms reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, including the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance for all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not impaired as of March 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2021 or 2020.\nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the valuation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of or for the three months\nended March 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise noted) 2021 2020\nFair value at beginning of period $ 3,276 $ 4,699\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs 404 271\nPurchase of MSRs 179 2\nDisposition of MSRs(a)\n1 (75)\nNet additions/(dispositions) 584 198\nChanges due to collection/realization of expected cash flows\n(187) (248)\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and assumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and other(b)\n836 (1,370)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to service)\n(24) (1)\nDiscount rates\n- -\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)\n(15) (11)\nTotal changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions (39) (12)\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions 797 (1,382)\nFair value at March 31, $ 4,470 $ 3,267\nChanges in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at March 31, $ 797 $ (1,382)\nContractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income\n291 364\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at March 31, (in billions) 444 506\nServicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at March 31, (in billions)(d)\n1.8 1.7\n(a)Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities (SMBS). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.\n(b)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(c)Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.\n(d)Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance), which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the trust or the underlying loans. The Firms credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However, certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules and agreements.\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk management activities) for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions) 2021 2020\nCCB mortgage fees and related income\nProduction revenue $ 757 $ 319\nNet mortgage servicing revenue:\nOperating revenue:\nLoan servicing revenue 248 339\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to collection/realization of expected cash flows (187) (248)\nTotal operating revenue 61 91\nRisk management:\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to market interest rates and other(a)\n836 (1,370)\nOther changes in MSR asset fair value due to other inputs and assumptions in model(b)\n(39) (12)\nChanges in derivative fair value and other (912) 1,292\nTotal risk management (115) (90)\nTotal net mortgage servicing revenue (54) 1\nTotal CCB mortgage fees and related income 703 320\nAll other 1 -\nMortgage fees and related income $ 704 $ 320\n(a)Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates, and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(b)Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).\nThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firms MSRs at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined below.\n(in millions, except rates) Mar 31,\n2021 Dec 31,\nWeighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate)\n10.28 % 14.90 %\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse change\n$ (195) $ (206)\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse change\n(375) (392)\nWeighted-average option adjusted spread(a)\n6.65 % 7.19 %\nImpact on fair value of a 100 basis point adverse change\n$ (197) $ (134)\nImpact on fair value of a 200 basis point adverse change\n(379) (258)\n(a)Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital.\nChanges in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not be linear.

The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firms principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators.\nThe following table presents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nStandardized Minimum capital ratios Advanced Minimum capital ratios Well-capitalized ratios\nBHC(a)\nIDI(c)\nBHC(a)(b)\nIDI(b)(c)\nBHC(d)\nIDI(e)\nCapital ratios\nCET1 capital 11.3 % 7.0 % 10.5 % 7.0 % NA 6.5 %\nTier 1 capital 12.8 8.5 12.0 8.5 6.0 % 8.0\nTotal capital 14.8 10.5 14.0 10.5 10.0 10.0\nTier 1 leverage 4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 NA 5.0\nSLR NA NA 5.0 6.0 NA 6.0\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a)Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios each include a respective minimum requirement plus a GSIB surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2; plus a 3.3% SCB for Basel III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal banking agencies.\n(b)Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI subsidiaries, respectively.\n(c)Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chases IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum capital ratios include a fixed capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.\n(d)Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.\n(e)Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.\nCECL regulatory capital transition delay\nAs part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.\nThe Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended March 31, 2021, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $4.5 billion,\nwhich is the $2.7 billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $7.0 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD loans).\nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital transition provisions.\nThe following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued an interim final rule which became effective April 1, 2020 and remained in effect through March 31, 2021 that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. did not elect to apply this exclusion.\n(c)The capital metrics reflect the CECL capital transition provisions. Additionally, loans originated under the PPP receive a zero percent risk weight.\nNote 22 - Off-balance sheet lending-related\nfinancial instruments, guarantees, and other\ncommitments\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firms view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firms related accounting policies.\nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\nOff-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments\nContractual amount Carrying value(i)\nMarch 31, 2021 Dec 31,\n2020 Mar 31,\n2021 Dec 31,\nBy remaining maturity\n(in millions) Expires in 1 year or less Expires after\n1 year through\n3 years Expires after\n3 years through\n5 years Expires after 5 years Total Total\nLending-related\nConsumer, excluding credit card:\nResidential real estate(a)\n$ 25,751 $ 1,741 $ 4,347 $ 12,813 $ 44,652 $ 46,047 $ 203 $ 148\nAuto and other 10,779 - 2 812 11,593 11,272 - -\nTotal consumer, excluding credit card 36,530 1,741 4,349 13,625 56,245 57,319 203 148\nCredit card(b)\n674,367 - - - 674,367 658,506 - -\nTotal consumer(b)(c)\n710,897 1,741 4,349 13,625 730,612 715,825 203 148\nWholesale:\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit(d)\n111,754 179,670 130,536 20,902 442,862 415,828 2,290 2,148\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees(d)\n17,294 7,658 8,497 1,324 34,773 30,982 692 443\nOther letters of credit(d)\n3,225 156 227 1 3,609 3,053 29 14\nTotal wholesale(c)\n132,273 187,484 139,260 22,227 481,244 449,863 3,011 2,605\nTotal lending-related $ 843,170 $ 189,225 $ 143,609 $ 35,852 $ 1,211,856 $ 1,165,688 $ 3,214 $ 2,753\nOther guarantees and commitments\nSecurities lending indemnification agreements and guarantees(e)\n$ 297,754 $ - $ - $ - $ 297,754 $ 250,418 $ - $ -\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees 2,142 195 12,043 39,200 53,580 54,415 318 322\nUnsettled resale and securities borrowed agreements 151,549 2,618 - - 154,167 96,848 3 2\nUnsettled repurchase and securities loaned agreements 107,597 836 - - 108,433 104,901 (1) (1)\nLoan sale and securitization-related indemnifications:\nMortgage repurchase liability NA - NA NA NA NA 72 84\nLoans sold with recourse NA - NA NA 823 889 23 23\nExchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments(f)\n84,852 - - - 84,852 142,003 - -\nOther guarantees and commitments(g)\n8,545 627 363 2,417 11,952 9,639 (h)\n59 52\n(a)Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b)Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.\n(c)Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d)At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling $61 million and $72 million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $8.1 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively, for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; and $597 million and $357 million, respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of risk participations.\n(e)At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification agreements was $314.3 billion and $264.3 billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(f)At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firms membership in certain clearing houses.\n(g)At March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market loans, unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments, and letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and managed on a market risk basis.\n(h)Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(i)For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and the guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\nMarch 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n(in millions) Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Other letters\nof credit Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Other letters\nof credit\nInvestment-grade(a)\n$ 26,608 $ 2,747 $ 22,850 $ 2,263\nNoninvestment-grade(a)\n8,165 862 8,132 790\nTotal contractual amount $ 34,773 $ 3,609 $ 30,982 $ 3,053\nAllowance for lending-related commitments $ 82 $ 29 $ 80 $ 14\nGuarantee liability 610 - 363 -\nTotal carrying value $ 692 $ 29 $ 443 $ 14\nCommitments with collateral $ 21,434 $ 879 $ 17,238 $ 498\n(a)The ratings scale is based on the Firms internal risk ratings.

Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information on these derivatives.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n(in millions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees $ 53,580 $ 54,415\nStable value contracts with contractually limited exposure\n27,782 27,752\nMaximum exposure of stable value contracts with contractually limited exposure\n2,805 2,803\nFair value\nDerivative payables\n318 322\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\nMerchant charge-backs\nUnder the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholders favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholders issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.\nLoan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications\nIn connection with the Firms mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding litigation.\nSponsored member repo program\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICCs rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients respective obligations under the FICCs rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firms maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 153. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\nGuarantees of subsidiaries\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (JPMFC), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firms unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 153 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.\nNote 23 - Pledged assets and collateral\nRefer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firms pledged assets and collateral.\nPledged assets\nThe Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm pledges assets for other purposes, including to collateralize repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits. Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated balance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firms pledged assets.\n(in billions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties\n$ 219.1 $ 166.6\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged or otherwise used by secured parties\n137.9 113.9\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks and FHLBs 446.8 455.3\nTotal pledged assets\n$ 803.8 $ 735.8\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of consolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the liabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for additional information on assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firms securities financing activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firms long-term debt.\nCollateral\nThe Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained under resale and other securities financing agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables and derivative contracts. Collateral is generally used under repurchase and other securities financing agreements, to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of collateral accepted.\n(in billions) March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nCollateral permitted to be sold or repledged, delivered, or otherwise used\n$ 1,340.6 $ 1,451.7\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or otherwise used 1,004.0 1,038.9\nNote 24 - Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of March 31, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firms lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.5 billion at March 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\nthe number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\nthe existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\nthe numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\nthe attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firms estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firms material legal proceedings.\nAmrapali. Indias Enforcement Directorate (ED) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (Amrapali). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under Indias Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $25 million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation.\nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FRN) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022.\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (FX) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded\nguilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-year exemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-year disqualification period. A South Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\nIn August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firms settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11 other defendants of that class action for a total of $10 million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia.\nInterchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision.\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized\nan agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Courts approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately.\nIn addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Associations (\"BBA\") London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for various currencies and the European Banking Federations Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR). The Swiss Competition Commissions investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants, including the Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November 2020, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar LIBOR and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. Defendants opposed that motion, which remains pending. The Firms settlements of putative\nclass actions related to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval.\nMetals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which, collectively, resolved those agencies respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016.\nThe Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with two counts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations.\nAcross the three resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $920 million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments.\nSeveral putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021.\nTwo putative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021, and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in March 2021.\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.\nWendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (Wendel) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase cooperated with the investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, Frances highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassations ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In April 2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chases appeal of the January 2021 decision of the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings.\n* * *\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has\nmeritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firms legal expense was $28 million and $197 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firms consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chases operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chases income for that period.\nNote 25 - Business segments\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firms Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chases business segments.\nSegment results\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firms segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firms definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to\npresent total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in our report dated February 23, 2021, which included a paragraph describing a change in the manner of accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments in the 2020 financial statements, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThese interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Firms management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\nMay 4, 2021\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\nConsolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates (unaudited)\n(Taxable-equivalent interest and rates; in millions, except rates)\nThree months ended March 31, 2021 Three months ended March 31, 2020\nAverage\nbalance Interest(g)\nRate\n(annualized) Average\nbalance Interest(g)\nRate\n(annualized)\nAssets\nDeposits with banks $ 631,606 $ 65 0.04 % $ 279,748 $ 569 0.82 %\nFederal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements\n289,763 233 0.33 253,403 1,095 1.74\nSecurities borrowed 175,019 (77) (0.18) (h)\n136,127 152\n0.45\nTrading assets - debt instruments 322,648 1,790 2.25 304,808 2,075 2.74\nTaxable securities 550,579 1,605 1.18 388,223 2,233 2.31\nNontaxable securities(a)\n31,881 348 4.43 33,306 365 4.41\nTotal investment securities 582,460 1,953 1.36 (i)\n421,529 2,598 2.48 (i)\nLoans 1,013,524 10,217 4.09 1,001,504 12,339 4.96\nAll other interest-earning assets(b)\n111,549 199 0.72 68,430 443 2.60\nTotal interest-earning assets 3,126,569 14,380 1.87 2,465,549 19,271 3.14\nAllowance for loan losses (28,268) (17,357)\nCash and due from banks 25,168 21,668\nTrading assets - equity and other instruments 159,727 114,479\nTrading assets - derivative receivables 79,013 66,309\nGoodwill, MSRs and other intangible Assets 53,932 52,690\nAll other noninterest-earning assets(c)\n196,700 185,986\nTotal assets $ 3,612,841 $ 2,889,324\nLiabilities\nInterest-bearing deposits $ 1,610,467 $ 146 0.04 % $ 1,216,555 $ 1,575 0.52 %\nFederal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements\n301,386 15 0.02 243,922 787 1.30\nShort-term borrowings(d)\n42,031 33 0.31 37,288 151 1.63\nTrading liabilities - debt and all other interest-bearing\nliabilities(e)(f)\n230,922 27 0.05 (h)\n192,950 372 0.77\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs 17,185 27 0.64 18,048 90 2.02\nLong-term debt 239,398 1,134 1.92 243,996 1,747 2.88\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 2,441,389 1,382 0.23 1,952,759 4,722 0.97\nNoninterest-bearing deposits 614,165 419,631\nTrading liabilities - equity and other instruments(f)\n35,029 30,721\nTrading liabilities - derivative payables 67,960 54,990\nAll other liabilities, including the allowance for lending-related commitments(c)\n178,444 167,287\nTotal liabilities 3,336,987 2,625,388\nStockholders equity\nPreferred stock 30,312 29,406\nCommon stockholders equity 245,542 234,530\nTotal stockholders equity 275,854 263,936\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity $ 3,612,841 $ 2,889,324\nInterest rate spread 1.64 % 2.17 %\nNet interest income and net yield on interest-earning assets $ 12,998 1.69 $ 14,549 2.37\n(a)Represents securities which are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n(b)Includes brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables, which are classified in accrued interest and accounts receivable, and all other interest-earning assets, which are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(c)Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

For AFS securities, amortized cost is also reduced by any impairment losses recognized in earnings. Amortized cost is not reduced by the allowance for credit losses, except where explicitly presented net.\nAOCI: Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss)\nARM(s): Adjustable rate mortgage(s)\nAUC: Assets under custody: Represents assets held directly or indirectly on behalf of clients under safekeeping, custody and servicing arrangements.\nAuto loan and lease origination volume: Dollar amount of auto loans and leases originated.\nAWM: Asset & Wealth Management\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs: represents the interest of third-party holders of debt, equity securities, or other obligations, issued by VIEs that JPMorgan Chase consolidates.\nBenefit obligation: refers to the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans.\nBHC: Bank holding company\nBridge Financing Portfolio: A portfolio of held-for-sale unfunded loan commitments and funded loans.

Services include procurement, corporate travel and entertainment, expense management services, and business-to-business payment solutions.\nCredit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the reference entity, which may include, among other events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of the reference entity, neither party has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value at the time of settling the credit derivative contract. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is generally made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Determinations Committee.\nCriticized: Criticized loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables that are classified as special mention, substandard and doubtful categories for regulatory purposes and are generally consistent with a rating of CCC+/Caa1 and below, as defined by S&P and Moodys.\nCRO: Chief Risk Officer\nCVA: Credit valuation adjustment\nDVA: Debit valuation adjustment\nEC: European Commission\nEligible HQLA: Eligible high-quality liquid assets, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule.\nEligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria\nEmbedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms or features of a financial instrument that affect some or all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An instrument containing such terms or features is referred to as a hybrid. The component of the hybrid that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to as the host. For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative). However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest rate swap.\nERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\nEPS: Earnings per share\nExchange-traded derivatives: Derivative contracts that are executed on an exchange and settled via a central clearing house.\nExpense categories:\nVolume- and/or revenue-related expenses generally correlate with changes in the related business/transaction volume or revenue. Examples of volume- and revenue-related expenses include commissions and incentive compensation, depreciation expense related to operating lease assets, and brokerage expense related to equities trading transaction volume.\nInvestments include expenses associated with supporting medium- to longer-term strategic plans of the Firm. Examples of investments include initiatives in technology (including related compensation), marketing, and compensation for new bankers and client advisors.\nStructural expenses are those associated with the day-to-day cost of running the bank and are expenses not covered by the above two categories. Examples of structural expenses include employee salaries and benefits, as well as noncompensation costs such as real estate and all other expenses.\nEU: European Union\nFannie Mae: Federal National Mortgage Association\nFASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board\nFCA: Financial Conduct Authority\nFDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nFederal Reserve: The Board of the Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nFFIEC: Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\nFHA: Federal Housing Administration\nFHLB: Federal Home Loan Bank\nFICO score: A measure of consumer credit risk based on information in consumer credit reports produced by Fair Isaac Corporation.

Morgan Securities: J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nLCR: Liquidity coverage ratio\nLGD: Loss given default\nLIBOR: London Interbank Offered Rate\nLLC: Limited Liability Company\nLOB: Line of business\nLTV: Loan-to-value ratio: For residential real estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate) securing the loan.\nOrigination date LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.\nCurrent estimated LTV ratio\nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien home equity products.\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management also uses this financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.\nMaster netting agreement: A single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due).\nMeasurement alternative: Measures equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nMerchant Services: offers merchants payment processing capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and analytics, and other payments services. Through Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept payments via credit and debit cards and payments in multiple currencies.\nMEV: Macroeconomic variable\nMBS: Mortgage-backed securities\nMD&A: Managements discussion and analysis\nMMLF: Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\nMMMF: Money market mutual funds\nMoodys: Moodys Investor Services\nMortgage product types:\nAlt-A\nAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality than subprime loans but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firms Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting requirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels. New prime mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and generally have reliable payment histories.\nSubprime\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were offered to certain customers with one or more high risk characteristics, including but not limited to: (i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other than the borrowers primary residence; or (v) a history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.\nMSA: Metropolitan statistical areas\nMSR: Mortgage servicing rights\nNA: Data is not applicable or available for the period presented.\nNAV: Net Asset Value\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average retained loans for the reporting period.\nNet interchange income includes the following components:\nInterchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit card issuers on sales transactions.\nRewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards programs generally tied to sales transactions.\nPartner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.\nNet yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid for all sources of funds.\nNFA: National Futures Association\nNM: Not meaningful\nNonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions, predominantly real estate owned and other commercial and personal property.\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\nOCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nOCI: Other comprehensive income/(loss)\nOPEB: Other postretirement employee benefit\nOTC: Over-the-counter derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled bilaterally between two derivative counterparties, where one or both counterparties is a derivatives dealer.\nOTC cleared: Over-the-counter cleared derivatives: Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of total net revenue.\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nParticipating securities: represents unvested share-based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (collectively, dividends), which are included in the earnings per share calculation using the two-class method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and RSUs to certain employees under its share-based compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities, based on their respective rights to receive dividends.\nPCD: Purchased credit deteriorated assets represent acquired financial assets that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Firm.\nPD: Probability of default\nPhishing: a type of social engineering cyberattack received through email or online messages.\nPPP: Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Association (\"SBA\")\nPPPL Facility: Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility\nPRA: Prudential Regulation Authority\nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.\nPrincipal transactions revenue: Principal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result of closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial and other instruments (including those accounted for under the fair value option) primarily used in client-driven market-making activities and on private equity investments. In connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities (including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities). Principal transactions revenue also includes certain realized and unrealized gains and losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-management activities, including: (a) certain derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\nPSU(s): Performance share units\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in accordance with regulatory rules.\nREO: Real estate owned\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-equivalent adjustments.\nRetained loans: Loans that are held-for-investment (i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value).\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates of investment banking fees generated across the industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt underwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive\napproaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.

A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds.\nA 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. The overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a funds three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at the individual share class level. The Nomura star rating is based on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and\nhence excluded from this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and at a primary share class level to represent the star rating of all other funds except for Japan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The primary share class, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, at a primary share class level to represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds. The primary share class, as defined by Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the most retail version (based upon annual management charge, minimum investment, currency and other factors). Where peer group rankings given for a fund are in more than one primary share class territory both rankings are included to reflect local market competitiveness (applies to Offshore Territories and HK SFC Authorized funds only). The performance data could have been different if all funds/accounts would have been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\nItem 3.

Controls and Procedures.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Firms management, including its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.\nThe Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom. Refer to Managements report on internal control over financial reporting on page 158 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firms internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Firms internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II - Other Information\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\nRefer to the discussion of the Firms material legal proceedings in Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for information that updates the disclosures set forth under Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings, in JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following discussion supplements the discussion of risk\nfactors affecting the Firm as set forth in Part I, Item 1A:\nRisk Factors on pages 8-32 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K. The discussion of risk factors, as so supplemented, sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chases businesses.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions, including:\nsignificant disruption and volatility in the financial markets\nsignificant disruption of global supply chains, and\nclosures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.\nA prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy.\nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations, including:\nreduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chases clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses.\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments.\nA prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chases businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including:\nrecognition of credit losses and further increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate from metropolitan areas\nmaterial impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets\ndowngrades in JPMorgan Chases credit ratings\nconstraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (RWA) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and\nthe possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chases workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chases businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed\nbecause of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chases participation directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:\nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny\nnegative publicity, and\nincreased exposure to litigation,\nany or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chases operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chases business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.\nSupervision and regulation\nRefer to the Supervision and regulation section on pages 3-7 of JPMorgan Chases 2020 Form 10-K for information on Supervision and Regulation.

Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion.
