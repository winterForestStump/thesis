The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3Ms four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). Refer to segment descriptions summarized below (Financial information and other disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments and operations in major geographic areas are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements):\nBusiness Segment Safety and Industrial Transportation and Electronics Health Care Consumer\nUnderlying divisions/businesses\nRefer to Note 2 for disaggregated revenue information\nAbrasives\nAutomotive aftermarket\nClosure and masking systems\nElectrical markets\nIndustrial adhesives and tapes\nPersonal safety\nRoofing granules\nAdvanced materials\nAutomotive and aerospace\nCommercial solutions\nDisplay materials and systems\nElectronics materials solutions\nTransportation safety\nHealth information systems\nMedical solutions\nOral care\nSeparation and purification sciences\nFood safety (divested in 2022)\nConsumer health and safety\nHome care\nHome improvement\nStationery and office\nRepresentative revenue-generating activities, products or services Industrial abrasives and finishing for metalworking applications\nAutobody repair solutions\nClosure systems for personal hygiene products, masking, and packaging materials\nElectrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)\nStructural adhesives and tapes\nRespiratory, hearing, eye and fall protection solutions\nNatural and color-coated mineral granules for shingles\nAdvanced ceramic solutions\nAttachment tapes, films, sound and temperature management for transportation vehicles\nPremium large format graphic films for advertising and fleet signage\nLight management films and electronics assembly solutions\nPackaging and interconnection solutions\nReflective signage for highway, and vehicle safety\nHealth care procedure coding and reimbursement software\nSkin, wound care, and infection prevention products and solutions\nDentistry and orthodontia solutions\nFiltration and purification systems\nConsumer bandages, braces, supports and consumer respirators\nCleaning products for the home\nRetail abrasives, paint accessories, car care DIY products, picture hanging and consumer air quality solutions\nStationery products\nSome seasonality impacts this business segment related to back-to-school, generally in the third quarter of each year\nExample brands/offerings 3M\u2122 Cubitron\u2122 II abrasives\nScotch-Brite\u2122 Abrasives\nScotch & Temflex Vinyl Tapes, Scotchkote Coatings, Dynatel locators, Scotchcast resins\nCollision repair and paint spray products\nReclosable fasteners; tapes and label materials for durable goods\nElectrical infrastructure products; medium voltage cable accessories and insulation tapes\n3M \u2122 VHB\u2122 Bonding tapes; Scotch\u00ae masking, packaging and filament tapes\nDisposable respirators and fall protection products\nScotchgard\u2122 Protector for shingles\n3M\u2122 Nextel\u2122 Ceramic fibers and textiles\nThinsulate\u2122 Acoustic Insulation products and automotive components\n3M\u2122 Novec\u2122 Engineered Fluids\n3M\u2122 Scotchlite\u2122 graphic films, 3M\u2122 Scotchcal\u2122 and 3M\u2122 Controltac\u2122 Commercial graphics\nElectronic display enhancement films and optically clear adhesives\nElectronic interconnect products\n3M\u2122 Diamond Grade\u2122 DG3 reflective sheeting for transportation safety\n3M\u2122 360 Encompass\u2122 medical coding systems\n3M \u2122 Tegaderm\u2122 wound dressings, V.A.C.\u00ae Therapy Systems and disposable respirators in the health care channel\n3M\u2122 Filtek\u2122 and 3M\u2122 RelyX\u2122 dental filing materials and cements; 3M\u2122 Clarity\u2122 aligners\nBiopharma and other filtration systems, bags, capsules and components\nACE\u2122 , FUTURO\u2122 and Nexcare\u2122 personal health care products\nScotch-Brite\u2122 cleaning supplies, sponges, brushes, and scouring pads; Scotchgard\u2122 products\nScotch\u00ae tapes and other products, Filtrete\u2122 filters and Command\u2122 adhesive products\nPost-it\u00ae products\nRepresentative market trends or opportunities Personal safety\nConnected bodyshop\nGrid modernization\nRobotics and automation\nAutomotive/mobility\nElectronic materials\nSemiconductor\nGraphic and architectural films\nWound care\nHealthcare IT\nBiopharma filtration\nHome improvement\nConsumer safety & well-being\nPackage protection & shipping\nAppearance auto care\nDistribution\n3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products - a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives - has contributed significantly to 3Ms position in the marketplace and to its growth.\nResources\nHuman Capital\nOn December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 92,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 37,000 employed in the United States and 55,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3Ms success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.\nHealth and Safety\n3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits.\nDevelopment\nDeveloping employees contributes to growing 3Ms business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the Companys chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company has a suite of high-potential leadership development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3M also has development programs for managers and supervisors and provides learning opportunities for all employees, in addition to regular coaching and support from their supervisor. With the Companys global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nA diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the Companys diversity with underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates.\nCompensation and Benefits\n3M has a trust-based approach to work that empowers employees to work where and when they can best achieve their goals, which supports attraction and retention of talent around the globe. In addition to a professional and flexible work environment that promotes innovation, well-being, and rewards performance, 3Ms total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Companys goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.\nRaw Materials\nIn 2022, many geopolitical, logistics, and disruptive events caused imbalance in the global supply chain, similar to the past few years. The Company experienced raw material price inflation and constrained supply throughout the global marketplace and continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact. To help manage disruption in its manufacturing operations, 3M deployed careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material price inflation in 2022.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nThe Companys products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Companys research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.\nThe Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Companys business segments.\nGovernment Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance\nThe Companys business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability; antitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.\n3Ms manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to Environmental Matters and Litigation in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Companys commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIn 2022, 3M expended approximately $317 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $646 million for 2023 and 2024 in aggregate.\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nFollowing is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there any undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

The Company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. In addition, the Companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Companys expected future business and financial performance. Words such as plan, expect, aim, believe, project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could, forecast and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. In particular, these include, among others, statements relating to:\nworldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, capital markets and other external conditions, such as interest rates, monetary policy, financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, inflation, recession, military conflicts, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or our suppliers and customers,\nrisks related to unexpected events such as the public health crises associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic,\nliabilities and the outcome of contingencies related to certain fluorochemicals known as \"PFAS,\" as well as matters related to the Company's plans to discontinue the use of PFAS,\nthe Companys strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market position,\ncompetitive conditions and customer preferences,\nforeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates,\nnew business opportunities, product and service development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products and services,\nfluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy,\ninformation technology systems including implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nsecurity breaches and other disruptions to information technology infrastructure,\nthe scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,\noperational execution, including inability to generate productivity improvements as estimated,\nfuture levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,\nfuture access to credit markets and the cost of credit,\npension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,\nasset impairments,\ntax liabilities and effects of changes in tax rates, laws or regulations,\nthe proposed spin-off of the Company's Health Care business to establish two separate public companies,\nthe voluntary chapter 11 proceedings initiated by the Company's Aearo Entities, and\nlaws and regulations, as well as legal compliance risks (including third-party risks), and legal and regulatory proceedings related to the same, including with regards to environmental matters and product liability, in the United States and other countries in which we operate.\nThe Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings of Overview, Financial Condition and Liquidity and annually in Critical Accounting Estimates. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. For additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nProvided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company. Discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to the Global Economy and Public Health Crises\n* The Companys results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other external conditions.\nThe Company operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States, and, accordingly, the Companys operations and the execution of its business strategies and plans are subject to global competition and economic and geopolitical risks that are beyond its control, such as, among other things, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns, military conflicts, public health emergencies such as COVID-19, political changes and trends such as protectionism, economic nationalism resulting in government actions impacting international trade agreements or imposing trade restrictions such as tariffs and retaliatory counter measures, and government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in locations or industries in which the Company operates. Further escalation of specific trade tensions, including those between the U.S. and China, or more broadly in global trade conflict, could adversely impact the Company's business and operations around the world. The Company's business is also impacted by social, political, and labor conditions in locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate; adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital; monetary policy; interest rates; inflation; recession; commodity prices; currency volatility or exchange control; ability to expatriate earnings; and other laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate. For example, changes in local economic condition or outlooks, such as lower economic growth rates in China, Europe, or other key markets, impact the demand or profitability of the Company's products.\nThe global economy has been impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. and other governments have imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022 and, in September 2022, committed to a plan to exit the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in Russia and has experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. These geopolitical tensions could result in, among other things, cyberattacks, further supply chain disruptions impacting downstream customers, higher energy costs, lower consumer demand, and changes to foreign exchange rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business and supply chain.\nClimate change, as well as related environmental and social regulations, may negatively impact the Company or its customers and suppliers, in terms of availability and cost of natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing, and the health and well-being of individuals and communities in which we or our suppliers or customers operate.\n* Unexpected events, such as those related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health crisis, may increase the Company's cost of doing business and disrupt the Company's operations.\n3M, as a global company, is impacted by unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), civil unrest, natural disasters, and severe weather in the locations in which the Company or its suppliers or customers operate, and these events have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company's operations and financial performance. For example, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, including related evolving governmental responses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3Ms operations, including its supply chain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Although COVID-19 increased demand for certain 3M products, it also resulted in decreased demand from certain end markets, made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers, and resulted in conditions that had the potential to damage 3M's reputation, including third-party price gouging, counterfeiting, and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving 3M's products. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. As the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators has experienced a decline from prior levels. 3M is not able to predict the impact of unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and unexpected events may have a material adverse effect on 3M's consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\nBecause the Companys financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Companys revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Companys results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies. For a discussion of the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, see Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\n* The Company faces liabilities related to certain fluorochemicals, which could adversely impact our results.\nAs previously reported, governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances produced by the Company, collectively known as PFAS. 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including declining emission standards and limits set as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may require additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company.\nThe PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as well as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS substances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical products like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various companies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3M. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving knowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production of two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce certain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. The Company continues to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3Ms current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3Ms decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations. The Company recognized a $0.8 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with this announcement related to asset impairments, and will incur additional expenses in connection with its exit activities. In addition, these two announced actions (the exit) involve risks, including the actual timing, costs, and financial impact of such exit; the Companys ability to complete such exit, on the anticipated timing or at all; potential governmental or regulatory actions relating to PFAS manufacturing and production, or the Companys exit plans; the Companys ability to identify and manufacture acceptable substitutes for the discontinued products, and the possibility that such substitutes will not achieve the anticipated or desired commercial or operational results; potential litigation relating to the Companys exit plans; and the possibility that the planned exit will involve greater costs than anticipated, or otherwise have negative impacts on the Companys relationships with its customers and other counterparties.\n3M currently is defending lawsuits concerning various PFAS-related products and chemistries, and is subject to unasserted and asserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the production and use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions, as discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 3M has seen increased public and private lawsuits being filed on behalf of states, counties, cities, and utilities alleging, among other things, harm to the general public and damages to natural resources, some of which are pending in the Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) multi-district litigation and some of which are pending in other jurisdictions. Various factors or developments in these and other disclosed actions could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on 3M. For example, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $897 million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 with respect to the settlement of a matter brought by the State of Minnesota involving the presence of PFAS in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life, and sediments in the state. Governmental inquiries, lawsuits, or laws and regulations involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, including orders to conduct remediation, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities, requiring the installation of control technologies, suspension or shutdown of facility operations, switching costs in seeking alternative sources of supply, potential customer damage claims due to supply disruptions or otherwise, and reporting requirements or bans on PFAS and PFAS-containing products manufactured by the Company.\n* The Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, as well as compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company or its suppliers, vendors, or channel partners to conduct business in a certain way. The outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to execute its strategy and its results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to international, federal, state, and local treaties, laws, and regulations, including those involving product liability; antitrust; intellectual property; environmental, health, and safety; tax; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws; international import and export requirements and trade sanctions compliance; regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies; U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations including the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws, and the Sunshine Act; and other matters. The Company is also subject to compliance risks related to legal or regulatory requirements, contract requirements, policies and practices, or other matters that require or encourage the Company and its suppliers, vendors, or channel parties, to conduct business in a certain way. Legal compliance risks also include third-party risks where the Companys suppliers, vendors, or channel partners have business practices that are inconsistent with 3Ms Supplier Responsibility Code, 3M performance requirements, or with legal requirements.\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if the costs to comply with these evolving treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are greater than projected by the Company. In addition, the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings related to compliance with these treaties, laws, regulations, and requirements are difficult to reliably predict, may differ from the Companys expectations, and can result in, among other things, criminal or civil sanctions, including fines; limitations on the extent to which the Company can conduct business; and private rights of action that result in litigation exposure, including expenses and costs incurred in connection with settlement or court proceedings, for the Company. Although the Company maintains general liability insurance to mitigate monetary exposure, the amount of liability that may result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed, the applicable insurance coverage. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows. In addition, negative publicity related to the matters noted above or other matters involving the Company may negatively impact the Companys reputation. The Company also relies on patent and other intellectual property protection, and challenges to the Companys intellectual property rights, or claims that the Companys activities interfere with the intellectual property rights of a third party, could cause the Company to incur significant expenses to assert or defend against such claims, could result in reduced revenue, and could damage the Companys reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Products and Customer Preferences\n* The Companys results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.\nDemand for the Companys products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by, among other things, (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Companys pricing strategies; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers, vendors, or channel partners; (iv) changes in customers preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Companys products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics, and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available data.\n* The Companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.\nThis ability is subject to difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.\n* The Companys future results are subject to vulnerability with respect to materials and fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials, energy, and labor due to shortages, increased demand and wages, logistics, supply chain interruptions, manufacturing site disruptions, regulatory developments, natural disasters, and other disruptive factors.\nThe Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. Supplier relationships have been and could be interrupted in the future due to supplier material shortage, climate impacts, natural and other disasters, and other disruptive events such as military conflicts, or be terminated. Any sustained interruption in the Companys receipt of adequate supplies, supply chain disruptions impacting the distribution of products, or disruption to key manufacturing sites operations due to natural and other disasters or events, such as government actions relating to discharge or emission permits or other legal or regulatory requirements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's processes to minimize volatility in component and material pricing will be successful or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\n* The Company employs information technology systems to support its business and collect, store, and use proprietary and confidential information, including ongoing phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years. Security and data breaches, cyberattacks, and other cybersecurity incidents involving the Companys information technology systems and infrastructure could disrupt or interfere with the Companys operations; result in the compromise and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information belonging to the Company or its customers, suppliers, and employees; and expose the Company to numerous expenses, liabilities, and other negative consequences, any or all of which could adversely impact the Companys business, reputation, and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on centralized and local information technology networks and systems, some of which are provided, hosted, or managed by vendors and other third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of businesses. Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and has access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls. Third parties and threat actors, including organized criminals, nation-state, or nation-state supported actors, regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Companys information technology networks and infrastructure, data, and other information, and many such attempts are increasingly sophisticated. Despite our cybersecurity and business continuity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems, patching, maintenance, and backup of systems and data), the Companys information technology networks and infrastructure are still potentially susceptible to attack, compromise, damage, disruption, or shutdown, including as a result of the exploitation of known or unknown hardware or software vulnerabilities in our systems or in the systems of our vendors and third-party service providers, the introduction of computer viruses or ransomware, service or cloud provider disruptions or security breaches, phishing attempts, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The Companys increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the pandemic, also introduces additional threats and risk of disruptions to our information technology networks and infrastructure. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or a cyberattack to remain undetected for an extended time period, up to and including several years, and the prioritization of decisions with respect to security measures and remediation of known vulnerabilities that we and the vendors and other third parties upon which we rely make may prove inadequate to protect against attacks. While we and third parties we utilize have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyberattacks on and breaches and disruptions of the Companys and the third parties' information technology systems and infrastructure, we do not believe that any such incidents to date have had a material impact on the Company. Any cybersecurity incident or information technology network disruption could result in numerous negative consequences, including the risk of legal claims or proceedings, investigations or enforcement actions by U.S., state, or foreign regulators; liabilities or penalties under applicable laws and regulations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions; interference with the Companys operations; the incurrence of remediation costs; loss of intellectual property protection; the loss of customer, supplier, or employee relationships; and damage to the Companys reputation, any of which could adversely affect the Companys business. Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various cybersecurity and business continuity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\n* Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other strategic events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring, could affect future results.\nThe Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and changes to its organizational structure. With respect to acquisitions and strategic alliances, future results will be affected by, as applicable, the Companys ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies and the Company's ability to operationalize and derive anticipated benefits from alliances. Divestitures may include continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction, will result in the loss of revenue associated with the businesses that are divested, and may result in unexpected liabilities through indemnification or other risk-shifting mechanisms in the applicable divestiture agreement. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Companys future results.\n* The Companys future results may be affected by its operational execution, including scenarios where the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than planned.\nThe Companys financial results depend on the successful execution of its business operating plans. The Company utilizes various tools, such as continuous improvement, to improve productivity and reduce expenses and engages in ongoing global business transformation to improve operational efficiency, productivity, and the speed and efficiency with which it serves customers. This is enabled by the ongoing multi-year phased implementation of an ERP system. There can be no assurance that we will realize the benefits of such activities, or that such activities will not result in unexpected consequences, such as a reduced ability to generate sales or provide the experience that our customers, suppliers, vendors, and channel partners expect from us. In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving customer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Companys ability to win new business and enhance revenue and 3Ms brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n* Change in the Companys credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\nThe Companys credit ratings are important to 3Ms cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Companys credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. The Companys credit ratings have served to lower 3Ms borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the Companys capital structure could impact 3Ms credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Companys cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n* Changes in tax rates, laws, or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Companys business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Companys Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and regulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nRisks Related to the Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings Initiated by the Companys Aearo Entities\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn July 26, 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (Aearo Entities\"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust - funded by the Company - to address potential liabilities related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms - Version 2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by Aearo Entities. This represents a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. Aearo Entities were acquired by the Company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries, have operated as Company subsidiaries since that time. 3M has entered into a funding agreement with Aearo Entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation, and to support Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the chapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the Companys reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and other counterparties and community members; impacts to the Companys liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of the Companys obligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with Aearo Entities; the costs of chapter 11 proceedings and length of time necessary to resolve the cases; and Aearo Entities ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the chapter 11 proceedings to obtain approval and consummation of a plan of reorganization. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot predict the timing, outcome, or financial impact of this matter, or any other ongoing or future litigation.\nRisks Related to the Planned Spin-off of the Companys Health Care Business\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Health Care business.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be tax-free for the Companys stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including final approval by the Companys board of directors, the filing and effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, and other customary conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, many of which are outside of the Companys control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of the spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized. There can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction (including costs of related restructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the transaction may impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the transaction; the impact on the Companys ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Companys relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other counterparties. In addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the Companys stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance that the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Health Care business, or the Companys stockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the price of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nIn the U.S., 3Ms general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in St. Paul, Minnesota. The Company operates 61 manufacturing facilities in 29 states. Internationally, the Company operates 83 manufacturing and converting facilities in 28 countries.\n3M owns the majority of its physical properties. 3Ms physical facilities are highly suitable for the purposes for which they were designed. Because 3M is a global enterprise characterized by substantial inter-segment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nDiscussion of legal matters is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nPursuant to Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), the Company is required to disclose, in connection with the mines it operates, information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters in its periodic reports filed with the SEC. The information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this annual report.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nEquity compensation plans information is incorporated by reference from Part III, Item 12, Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Item 5. At January 31, 2023, there were 62,488 shareholders of record. 3Ms stock ticker symbol is MMM and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., and the SIX Swiss Exchange. Cash dividends declared and paid totaled $1.49 and $1.48 per share for each quarter in 2022 and 2021, respectively. 3M typically declares and pays dividends in the same quarter.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nRepurchases of 3M common stock are made to support the Companys stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity\nSecurities (registered pursuant to\nSection 12 of the Exchange Act)\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (2) Maximum Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased under the Plans or Programs (Millions)\nJanuary 1 - 31, 2022\n1,458,623 $ 176.61 1,458,623 $ 5,329\nFebruary 1 - 28, 2022\n1,445,206 147.03 1,441,534 5,117\nMarch 1 - 31, 2022\n1,871,301 145.61 1,871,301 4,845\nJanuary 1 - March 31, 2022\n4,775,130 155.51 4,771,458\nApril 1 - 30, 2022\n- - - 4,845\nMay 1 - 31, 2022\n- - - 4,845\nJune 1 - 30, 2022\n- - - 4,845\nApril 1 - June 30, 2022\n- - -\nJuly 1 - 31, 2022\n- - - 4,845\nAugust 1 - 31, 2022\n- - - 4,845\nSeptember 1 - 30, 2022\n1,665,747 114.10 1,665,747 4,655\nJuly 1 - September 30, 2022\n1,665,747 114.10 1,665,747\nOctober 1 - 31, 2022\n2,831,831 114.21 2,831,831 4,331\nNovember 1 - 30, 2022\n1,002,117 126.87 1,002,117 4,204\nDecember 1 - 31, 2022\n378,006 125.91 378,006 4,157\nOctober 1 - December 31, 2022\n4,211,954 118.27 4,211,954\nJanuary 1 - December 31, 2022\n10,652,831 134.31 10,649,159\n____________________\n(1)The total number of shares purchased includes: (i) shares purchased under the Boards authorizations described above, and (ii) shares purchased in connection with the exercise of stock options.\n(2)The total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs includes shares purchased under the Boards authorizations described above. Item 6. [Reserved]. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of 3Ms financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3Ms MD&A is presented in eight sections:\nOverview\nResults of Operations\nPerformance by Business Segment\nPerformance by Geographic Area\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nFinancial Instruments\nForward-looking statements in Item 7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results in Item 1 and the risk factors provided in Item 1A for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).\nAdditional information about results of operations and financial condition for 2021 and 2020 can be found in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections in 3M's Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 26, 2022 (which updated 3M's 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOVERVIEW\n3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products and services. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made the following changes:\nChanges in measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker-impacting 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2.\nChanges to non-GAAP measures - certain amounts adjusted for special items. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional information.\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\n3M manages its operations in four operating business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. From a geographic perspective, any references to EMEA refer to Europe, Middle East and Africa on a combined basis. References are made to organic sales change (which include both organic volume impacts and selling price impacts), which is defined as the change in net sales, absent the separate impacts on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Acquisition and divestiture sales change impacts, if any, are measured separately for the first twelve months post-transaction. 3M believes this information is useful to investors and management in understanding ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends.\n3M is impacted by the global pandemic and related effects associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19). Risk factors with respect to COVID-19 can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors in this document. Given the diversity of 3Ms businesses, some of the factors relative to COVID-19 increase the demand for 3M products, while others decrease demand or make it more difficult for 3M to serve customers. Certain resulting impacts are referenced in various discussions within this Item 7. Overall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3Ms consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. 3M is not able to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2022, 3M's costs for significant litigation (see Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures section below) totaled approximately $2.3 billion pre-tax and included, among things, pre-tax charges associated with steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation and associated with additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at its Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (approximately $1.3 billion and $355 million, respectively, in 2022). These matters are further discussed in Note 16. In 2022, 3M also completed the split-off of its Food Safety Division business resulting in a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion and committed to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 resulting in a 2022 pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion related to impairment as discussed in Note 15. See Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below for additional discussion of these and other special items.\n3M Belgium has experienced interruptions to portions of the manufacturing at its site in Zwijndrecht, Belgium, as more fully discussed in Note 16. As discussed in Note 16, 3M Belgium received agreement with authorities in June 2022 to begin the process toward restarting operations at the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium has provided information required by the Flemish environmental authorities to receive agreement from the authorities to restart operations, and has done so for production or sampling purposes. Belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of these operations and compliance with applicable requirements. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate and continues to work with the government authorities to comply with applicable legal requirements. See further discussion in Note 16.\n3M is also impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In light of a number of factors, 3M suspended operations of its subsidiaries in Russia in March 2022, the net sales of which were less than one percent of 3Ms consolidated net sales for 2021. Further, in September 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of the related net assets through an intended sale of the subsidiaries. The associated charge in 2022 related to this action is further discussed in Note 15. 3M also has other operations that source certain raw materials from suppliers in Russia and have experienced related supply disruption due to the conflict. Further supply disruption could lead to downstream customer impacts.\nThough 3M monitors relevant factors as well as options to mitigate potential impacts, it is not able to predict the extent to which these circumstances may have a material effect on 3Ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition. Relevant risk factors can be found in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating income margin and earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted:\nThe following table provides the increases (decreases) in operating income margins and diluted earnings per share.\nYear ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nPercent of net sales Earnings per diluted share Percent of net sales Earnings per diluted share\nSame period last year 20.8 % $ 10.12 22.3 % $ 9.36\nNet costs for significant litigation 1.4 0.61 1.0 0.37\nGain on business divestitures - - (1.2) (0.52)\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions - - 0.2 0.08\nTotal special items 1.4 0.61 - (0.07)\nSame period last year, excluding special items 22.2 10.73 22.3 9.29\nIncrease/(decrease) due to:\nTotal organic growth/productivity and other 1.0 0.56 0.7 1.07\nRaw material impact (2.4) (1.13) (0.8) (0.27)\nDivestitures - (0.05) - (0.05)\nForeign exchange impacts - (0.39) - 0.16\nOther expense (income), net N/A 0.02 N/A 0.27\nIncome tax rate N/A 0.06 N/A 0.32\nShares of common stock outstanding N/A 0.30 N/A (0.06)\nCurrent period, excluding special items 20.8 10.10 22.2 10.73\nNet costs for significant litigation (6.7) (3.20) (1.4) (0.61)\nDivestiture costs (0.2) (0.08) - -\nGain on business divestitures 8.0 4.73 - -\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions (0.1) (0.05) - -\nRussia exit charges (0.3) (0.20) - -\nPFAS manufacturing exit costs (2.4) (1.12) - -\nTotal special items (1.7) 0.08 (1.4) (0.61)\nCurrent period 19.1 % $ 10.18 20.8 % $ 10.12\nThe Company refers to various \"adjusted\" amounts or measures on an adjusted basis.

The following also impacted results or provide additional information:\n2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from a favorable Brazilian Supreme Court decision that concluded on the impact of state value-added tax when determining Brazils federal sales-based social tax-essentially lowering the social tax that 3M should have paid in prior periods.\n3M continued prioritization of investments in growth and sustainability.\n2021 benefit from higher selling prices, restructuring actions taken in 2020 and positive/negative impact of year-over-year change in non-divestiture-related restructuring charges, net of adjustments, for respective periods. Note 5 provides additional information relative to restructuring actions.\nLower year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales.\nCOVID-impacts recognized on certain assets in 2020.\nIn 2021, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year.\nRaw material impact:\nIn 2022, 3M continued to experience inflationary pressures with year-on-year increases in raw material and logistics costs driven by many geopolitical, logistics, and disruptive events that caused imbalance in the global supply chain.\nIn 2021, 3M experienced higher raw material, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing costs from strong end-market demand, ongoing COVID-19 and related global supply chain challenges that were further magnified by extreme weather events, such as February 2021 winter storm Uri in the U.S.\nAcquisitions/divestitures:\nDivestiture impacts in 2022 include lost income from divested businesses and remaining stranded costs (net of transition arrangement income). 3M completed the split-off of the Food Safety business in September 2022 (discussed in Note 3). The impact also includes lost income from deconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in July 2022 (discussed in Note 16).\nDivestiture impacts in 2021 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the Companys drug delivery business (sale completed in May 2020).\nForeign exchange impacts:\nForeign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income by approximately $271 million and $103 million (or a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $280 million and $119 million) year-on-year for 2022 and 2021, respectively. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nOther expense (income), net:\nLower income related to higher non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense increased expense year-on-year for 2022. Higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-on-year for 2021.\nInterest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash.\nInterest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same period year-on-year due in part to interest expense savings from early debt extinguishment actions in 2020.\nIncome tax rate:\nCertain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate for 2022 were the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on split-off of the Food Safety business (see Note 3). The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions.\nOn an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 17.7 percent, 18.1 percent, and 20.5 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 0.4 percent percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 2.4 percentage points from 2020 to 2021.\nShares of common stock outstanding:\nLower shares outstanding increased earnings per share per diluted share for 2022, while higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share diluted share for 2021.\nCertain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures):\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, 3M also provides non-GAAP measures that adjust for the impacts of special items. For the periods presented, special items include the items described below. Operating income, segment operating income (loss), income before taxes, net income, earnings per share, and the effective tax rate are all measures for which 3M provides the reported GAAP measure and a measure adjusted for special items. The adjusted measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, GAAP measures. While the Company includes certain items in its measure of segment operating performance, it also considers these non-GAAP measures in evaluating and managing its operations. The Company believes that discussion of results adjusted for special items is useful to investors in understanding underlying business performance, while also providing additional transparency to the special items. Special items impacting operating income are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated, except as described below with respect to net costs for significant litigation and PFAS manufacturing exit costs. The determination of these items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed the extent of matters and charges/benefits it includes within special items with respect to net costs for significant litigation. Previously, 3M included net costs, when significant, associated with changes in accrued liabilities related to respirator mask/asbestos litigation and PFAS-related other environmental matters, along with the associated tax impacts. These non-GAAP measure changes involved including net costs for litigation related to 3Ms Combat Arms Earplugs, expanding net costs to include external legal fees and insurance recoveries associated with the applicable matters in addition to changes in accrued liabilities, and to include all such net costs for the applicable matters, not just when considered significant. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nSpecial items for the periods presented include:\nNet costs for significant litigation:\nThese relate to 3M's respirator mask/asbestos, PFAS-related other environmental, and Combat Arms Earplugs matters (as discussed in Note 16). Net costs include the impacts of any changes in accrued liabilities, external legal fees, and insurance recoveries, along with associated tax impacts. Prior to initiating voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in July 2022, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters along with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. During the bankruptcy period, net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continue to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Net costs associated with PFAS-related other environmental matters are primarily reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated.\nDivestiture costs:\nThese include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\nGain on business divestitures:\nIn 2022, 3M recorded a gain related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation. In 2020, 3M recorded a gain primarily related to the divestiture of its Drug Delivery business. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, following the split-off of the Food Safety business, and in 2020, following the divestiture of the Drug Delivery business, (see Note 3) management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions addressing corporate functional costs across 3M in relation to the magnitude of amounts previously allocated to the divested businesses. Refer to Note 5 for further details.\nRussia exit charges:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a charge primarily related to impairment of net assets in Russia in connection with management's committed exit and disposal plan. Refer to Note 15 for further details.\nPFAS manufacturing exit costs:\nThese costs relate to 3M's December 2022 commitment to a plan to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. Charges for the applicable period relate to asset impairments. These charges were reflected within the Transportation and Electronics business segment. Refer to Note 15 for further details.\nOperating Income (Loss)\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Safety and Industrial Safety and Industrial Margin Transportation and Electronics Transportation and Electronics Margin Total Company Total Company Margin Income Before Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate Net Income Attributable to 3M Earnings per Diluted Share Earnings per diluted share percent change\nYear ended December 31, 2020 GAAP\n$ 2,588 23.6% $ 1,701 20.2% $ 7,161 22.3 % $ 6,795 $ 1,337 19.7 % $ 5,449 $ 9.36\nAdjustments for special items:\nNet costs for significant litigation 205 - 353 353 136 217 0.37\nGain on business divestitures - - (389) (389) (86) (303) (0.52)\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions - - 55 55 9 46 0.08\nTotal special items 205 - 19 19 59 (40) (0.07)\nYear ended December 31, 2020 adjusted amounts (non-GAAP measures)\n$ 2,793 25.5% $ 1,701 20.2% $ 7,180 22.3 % $ 6,814 $ 1,396 20.5 % $ 5,409 $ 9.29\nYear ended December 31, 2021 GAAP\n$ 2,466 20.6% $ 1,880 20.3% $ 7,369 20.8 % $ 7,204 $ 1,285 17.8 % $ 5,921 $ 10.12 8 %\nAdjustments for special items:\nNet costs for significant litigation 249 - 463 463 104 359 0.61\nTotal special items 249 - 463 463 104 359 0.61\nYear ended December 31, 2021 adjusted amounts (non-GAAP measures)\n$ 2,715 22.7% $ 1,880 20.3% $ 7,832 22.2 % $ 7,667 $ 1,389 18.1 % $ 6,280 $ 10.73 16 %\nYear ended December 31, 2022 GAAP\n$ 1,199 10.3% $ 1,012 11.4% $ 6,539 19.1 % $ 6,392 $ 612 9.6 % $ 5,777 $ 10.18 1 %\nAdjustments for special items:\nNet costs for significant litigation 1,414 - 2,291 2,291 476 1,815 3.20\nDivestiture costs - - 60 60 13 47 0.08\nGain on business divestitures - - (2,724) (2,724) (39) (2,685) (4.73)\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions - - 41 41 9 32 0.05\nRussia exit charges - - 109 109 (2) 111 0.20\nPFAS manufacturing exit costs - 800 800 800 162 638 1.12\nTotal special items 1,414 800 577 577 619 (42) (0.08)\nYear ended December 31, 2022 adjusted amounts (non-GAAP measures)\n$ 2,613 22.5% $ 1,812 20.4% $ 7,116 20.8 % $ 6,969 $ 1,231 17.7 % $ 5,735 $ 10.10 (6) %\nSales and operating income (loss) by business segment:\nThe following tables contain sales and operating income (loss) results by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Total sales in Mexico increased 8 percent which included increased organic sales of 12 percent. In Canada, total sales increased 9 percent which included increased organic sales of 13 percent. In Brazil, total sales increased 15 percent which included increased organic sales of 12 percent. In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales decreased 6 percent which included decreased organic sales of 3 percent. In Japan, total sales decreased 12 percent which included increased organic sales of 2 percent.\nFor the full year 2021, in the Americas geographic area, U.S. total sales increased 8 percent which included increased organic sales of 8 percent. Total sales in Mexico increased 18 percent which included increased organic sales of 16 percent. In Canada, total sales increased 18 percent which included increased organic sales of 11 percent. In Brazil, total sales increased 18 percent which included increased organic sales of 22 percent. In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China total sales increased 17 percent which included increased organic sales of 11 percent. In Japan, total sales were flat which included increased organic sales of 2 percent.\nManaging currency risks:\nThe stronger U.S. dollar had a negative impact on sales in full year 2022 compared to the same periods last year. Net of the Companys hedging strategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in full year 2022 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month horizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is largely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3Ms hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3Ms businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3Ms Board of Directors replaced the Companys February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2022, the Company purchased $1.5 billion of its own stock, compared to $2.2 billion of stock purchases in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the authorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M.\nRaw materials:\nRefer to the section entitled Raw materials in Item 1 for discussion of 3M's sources and availability of raw materials in 2022.\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\nOn a worldwide basis, 3Ms pension and postretirement plans were 96 percent funded at year-end 2022. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is approximately 70 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 97 percent funded and the international pension plans were 116 percent funded. The U.S. non-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors. Asset returns in 2022 for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan were -17.4 percent, as 3M strategically invests in both growth assets and fixed income matching assets to manage its funded status. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2023 is 7.5 percent. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan year-end 2022 discount rate was 5.18%, up 2.29 percentage points from the year-end 2021 discount rate of 2.89%. The increase in U.S. discount rates resulted in a decreased valuation of the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The primary U.S. qualified pension plans funded status remained at 97% as of December 31, 2022 due to the lower PBO resulting from the discount rate increase, offset by the negative returns of the plan's assets. Additional detail and discussion of international plan asset returns and discount rates is provided in Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans).\n3M expects to contribute approximately $100 million to $200 million of cash to its global defined benefit pension and postretirement plans in 2023. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2023. 3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $30 million pre-tax when compared to 2022. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates within MD&A and Note 13 (Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans) for additional information concerning 3Ms pension and post-retirement plans.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\n(Percent of net sales) 2022 2021 Change\nCost of sales 56.2 % 53.2 % 3.0 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) 26.5 20.4 6.1\nResearch, development and related expenses (R&D) 5.4 5.6 (0.2)\nGain on business divestitures (8.0) - (8.0)\nGoodwill impairment expense 0.8 - 0.8\nOperating income margin 19.1 % 20.8 % (1.7) %\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. Increases were primarily due to 2022 special item costs for significant litigation from additional commitments to address PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16), higher raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and progress on restarting previously-idled operations, and investments in growth, productivity and sustainability. On a percent of sales basis, these increases were partially offset by increases in selling prices.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring charges (see Note 5), and continued investment in key growth initiatives. These increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general 3M cost management.\nResearch, Development and Related Expenses:\nR&D, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. 3M continues to invest in a range of R&D activities from application development, product and manufacturing support, product development and technology development aimed at disruptive innovations.\nGain on Business Divestitures:\nIn the third quarter of 2022, 3M recorded a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion ($2.7 billion after tax) related to the split-off and combination of its Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation. Refer to Note 3 for further details.\nGoodwill Impairment Expense:\nAs a result of 3M's commitment to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business). Refer to Note 15 for further details.\nOther Expense (Income), Net:\nSee Note 6 for a detailed breakout of this line item.\nInterest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2022 compared to the same period year-on-year driven by debt maturities in the ordinary course and interest income on invested cash. Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same period year-on-year due in part to interest expense savings from early debt extinguishment actions in 2020.\nThe non-service pension and postretirement net benefit decreased $49 million and increased $163 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lower year-on-year benefit in 2022 was primarily due to higher interest costs due to higher discount rates as of the year-end 2021, lower expected returns on plan assets for 2023, partially offset by a reduction in actuarial loss amortization, which was driven by the lower discount rates. Refer to Note 13 for additional details.\nProvision for Income Taxes:\n(Percent of pre-tax income) 2022 2021\nEffective tax rate 9.6 % 17.8 %\nFactors that impacted the tax rates between years are further discussed in the Overview section above and in Note 10.\nThe tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits, changes in tax laws, and employee share-based payment accounting; as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.\nRefer to Note 10 for further discussion of income taxes.\nIncome from Unconsolidated Subsidiaries, Net of Taxes:\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes $ 11 $ 10\nIncome (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries, net of taxes, is attributable to the Companys accounting under the equity method for ownership interests in certain entities such as Kindeva following 3M's divestiture of the drug delivery business in 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 3M sold its remaining ownership interest in Kindeva resulting in an immaterial gain.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest:\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest $ 14 $ 8\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest represents the elimination of the income or loss attributable to non-3M ownership interests in 3M consolidated entities. The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3Ms effective ownership is 75 percent.\nPERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\nItem 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3Ms business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3Ms business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Companys business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\nCorporate and Unallocated:\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to Corporate and Unallocated, which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes corporate special items and other corporate expense-net. Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation associated with Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters during the chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022) and with PFAS-related other environmental matters (see Note 16). Corporate special items also include divestiture costs, gain/loss on business divestitures (see Note 3), divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5), and Russia exit costs (see Note 15). Divestiture costs include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from transition supply, manufacturing and service arrangements with Neogen Corporation following the split-off of 3M's Food Safety business in 2022 and with the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nCorporate and Unallocated operating expenses decreased in 2022, when compared to the same period last year. The subsections below provide additional information.\nCorporate Special Items\nRefer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items and to Note 19 for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased in 2022 year over year primarily due to the gain on divestiture associated with the 2022 split-off of the Food Safety business (discussed in Note 3) partially offset by additional commitments in 2022 to address PFAS-related matters, including at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site (discussed in Note 16).\nOther Corporate Expense - Net\nOther corporate operating expenses, net, increased when compared to the same period last year primarily due to a $91 million pre-tax benefit from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court included in the second quarter of 2021 regarding the calculation of past social taxes.\nOperating Business Segments:\nInformation related to 3Ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables.\nSafety and Industrial Business (33.9% of consolidated sales):\n2022 2021\nSales (millions) $ 11,604 $ 11,981\nSales change analysis:\nOrganic sales 1.0 % 7.3 %\nTranslation (4.2) 1.9\nTotal sales change (3.2 %) 9.2 %\nBusiness segment operating income (loss) (millions) $ 1,199 $ 2,466\nPercent change (51.4 %) (4.7 %)\nPercent of sales 10.3 % 20.6 %\nAdjusted business segment operating income (millions) (non-GAAP measure) $ 2,613 $ 2,715\nPercent change (3.7) % (2.8) %\nPercent of sales 22.5 % 22.7 %\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs for respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related) and Combat Arms Earplugs litigation matters. During the Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 - see Note 16), net costs related to Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters are reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continue to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\nYear 2022 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 3.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in electrical markets, abrasives, automotive aftermarket, roofing granules, closure and masking systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes and decreased in personal safety.\nGrowth from continued improving general industrial manufacturing activity and other end-market demand was partially offset by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety, which negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 4.5 percentage points.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to special item costs for significant litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion. Margins were also impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, partially offset by selling price actions, spending discipline and restructuring actions. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as displayed above.\nYear 2021 results:\nSales in Safety and Industrial were up 9.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, electrical markets, roofing granules, and closure and masking systems and decreased in personal safety.\nGrowth was driven by improving general industrial manufacturing activity and other end-market demand partially offset by prior-year strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to increases in raw materials, logistics and special item costs for significant litigation; lower gain on sale of properties; and manufacturing productivity impacts that were partially offset by sales growth leverage, and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as displayed above.\nTransportation and Electronics Business (26.0% of consolidated sales):\n2022 2021\nSales (millions) $ 8,902 $ 9,262\nSales change analysis:\nOrganic sales 1.2 % 8.7 %\nDivestitures (0.5) -\nTranslation (4.6) 1.5\nTotal sales change (3.9) % 10.2 %\nBusiness segment operating income (millions) $ 1,012 $ 1,880\nPercent change (46.2) % 10.6 %\nPercent of sales 11.4 % 20.3 %\nAdjusted business segment operating income (millions) (non-GAAP measure) $ 1,812 $ 1,880\nPercent change (3.6) % 10.6 %\nPercent of sales 20.4 % 20.3 %\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Transportation and Electronics these adjustments include PFAS manufacturing exit costs. Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\nYear 2022 results:\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in automotive and aerospace, commercial solutions and advanced materials, and decreased in transportation safety and electronics.\nGrowth was held back by weaker consumer electronics end-market demand and ongoing impacts of semiconductor supply chain constraints on automotive markets.\nDivestitures:\nDivestiture impact relates to lost Transportation and Electronics sales year-on-year from deconsolidation of the Aearo Entities in July 2022.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to special item charges for PFAS manufacturing exit costs related to asset impairments (discussed in Note 15) resulting in a 2022 fourth quarter pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion. Margins were also impacted by increased raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds which were further magnified by the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium and investments in auto electrification, partially offset by selling price actions, strong spending discipline and restructuring actions. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufacturing exit costs (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\nYear 2021 results:\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were up 10.2 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in advanced materials, commercial solutions, automotive and aerospace, electronics and transportation safety.\nGrowth benefited from improving automotive-end market activity such as increases in car and light truck builds, strong demand in data center, semiconductor, interconnect and consumer electronics markets and increased advertising spend and return to workplace trends partially offset by impacts from semiconductor supply chain constraints.\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage, benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges, and COVID impacts recognized on certain assets in 2020 that were partially offset by increases in raw materials and logistic costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs.\nHealth Care Business (24.6% of consolidated sales):\n2022 2021\nSales (millions) $ 8,421 $ 8,597\nSales change analysis:\nOrganic sales 3.2 % 10.2 %\nDivestitures (1.4) (2.0)\nTranslation (3.8) 1.6\nTotal sales change (2.0) % 9.8 %\nBusiness segment operating income (millions) $ 1,815 $ 2,037\nPercent change (10.9) % 22.5 %\nPercent of sales 21.6 % 23.7 %\nYear 2022 results:\nSales in Health Care were down 2.0 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in separation and purification, health information systems, food safety and medical solutions, and was flat in oral care.\nGrowth continues to be impacted by COVID-related trends on elective procedure volumes and ongoing inflationary pressures.\nDivestitures:\nDivestiture impact relates to the lost sales year-on-year from the divestiture from the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen completed in the third quarter of 2022.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to increased raw materials and logistics costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds, investments in the business and transaction-related costs associated with the announced divestiture of the food safety business (see Note 3), partially offset by sales growth (including selling price actions), strong spending discipline and restructuring actions.\nAs discussed in Note 3, in July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain a 19.9% ownership position in the Health Care business.\nYear 2021 results:\nSales in Health Care were up 9.8 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in oral care, separation and purification, food safety, health information systems and medical solutions.\nGrowth benefited from higher year-on-year dental procedures, continued high demand for biopharma filtration solutions for COVID-related vaccine and therapeutic development and manufacturing, rising elective procedure volumes in the first six months of 2021 and due to improving hospital information technology investments.\nDivestitures:\nIn May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its drug delivery business.\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year due to sales growth leverage and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges that were partially offset by supply chain disruptions, increases in raw materials and logistics costs, deal-related costs associated with the announced divestiture of the food safety business (see Note 3), manufacturing productivity impacts, increased compensation and benefit costs, and increased investments in growth.\nConsumer Business (15.5% of consolidated sales):\n2022 2021\nSales (millions) $ 5,298 $ 5,513\nSales change analysis:\nOrganic sales (0.9) % 9.8 %\nDivestitures (0.4) -\nTranslation (2.6) 1.0\nTotal sales change (3.9) % 10.8 %\nBusiness segment operating income (millions) $ 994 $ 1,162\nPercent change (14.4) % 3.8 %\nPercent of sales 18.8 % 21.1 %\nYear 2022 results:\nSales in Consumer were down 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in stationery and office and home care, was flat in consumer health and safety, and decreased in home improvement.\nGrowth was impacted by softening trends in the Consumer retail business as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending and retailers took actions to reduce their inventories. These impacts were partially offset by demand for Scotch BlueTM painters tape, Scotch-BriteTM, and Post-it\u00ae-solutions.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as a result of increased raw materials, logistics and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs along with manufacturing productivity headwinds and investments in the business, partially offset by sales growth (including selling price actions), strong spending discipline and restructuring actions.\nYear 2021 results:\nSales in Consumer were up 10.8 percent in U.S. dollars.\nOn an organic sales basis:\nSales increased in stationery and office, home improvement, consumer health and safety and home care.\nGrowth driven by continued strength in the market with strong demand for CommandTM adhesives, FiltreteTM air quality solutions, MeguiarsTM auto care and Scotch BlueTM painters tape and from ongoing strength in demand for packaging and shipping products, Post-it\u00ae-solutions and Scotch\u00ae brand office tapes as the business laps last years COVID-related comparisons.\nBusiness segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year as a result of increases in raw materials, logistics, and outsourced hardgoods manufacturing costs, manufacturing productivity impacts, and increased compensation and benefit costs that more than offset leverage from sales growth and benefits from restructuring actions and lower related charges.\nPERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\nWhile 3M manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the Company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. Export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. A portion of the products or components sold by 3Ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. As customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3Ms results will follow. Thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area. Financial information related to 3M operations in various geographic areas is provided in Note 2 and Note 19.\nRefer to the Overview section for a summary of net sales by geographic area and business segment.\nGeographic Area Supplemental Information\nEmployees as of December 31, Capital Spending Property, Plant and Equipment - net as of December 31,\n(Millions, except Employees) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nAmericas 54,000 56,000 $ 1,321 $ 1,046 $ 6,066 $ 5,864\nAsia Pacific 18,000 18,000 182 216 1,389 1,582\nEurope, Middle East and Africa 20,000 21,000 246 341 1,723 1,983\nTotal Company 92,000 95,000 $ 1,749 $ 1,603 $ 9,178 $ 9,429\nEmployment:\nEmployment decreased in 2022 when compared to 2021. The above table includes the impact of acquisitions, net of divestitures and other actions.\nCapital Spending/Net Property, Plant and Equipment:\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. 3M is increasing its investment in manufacturing and sourcing capability in order to more closely align its product capability with its sales in major geographic areas in order to best serve its customers throughout the world with proprietary, automated, efficient, safe and sustainable processes. Capital spending is discussed in more detail later in MD&A in the section entitled Cash Flows from Investing Activities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nInformation regarding significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As stated in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nThe Company considers the items below to be critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of 3Ms Board of Directors.\nLegal Proceedings:\nAssessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain, and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 450, Contingencies. Please refer to the section entitled Process for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings (contained in Legal Proceedings in Note 16) for additional information about such estimates.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations:\nThe Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets in determining its defined benefit pension and postretirement obligations and related net periodic benefit costs. The below further describes these estimates. Note 13 provides the weighted averages of these assumptions as of applicable dates and for respective periods and additional information on how the rates were determined.\nDiscount rate\nThe defined benefit pension and postretirement obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of the measurement date. The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the December 31 measurement date, using the yields of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in expected benefit payment and service cost cash flows, as well as ongoing changes in market activity and yields, cause these rates to be subject to uncertainty.\nUsing this methodology, the Company determined discount rates for its plans as follow:\nU.S. Qualified Pension International Pension (weighted average) U.S. Postretirement Medical\nDecember 31, 2022 Liability:\nBenefit obligation 5.18 % 4.39 % 5.13 %\n2023 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Components:\nService cost 5.27 % 4.06 % 5.26 %\nInterest cost 5.11 % 4.39 % 5.05 %\nExpected return on plan assets\nThe expected return on plan assets for the primary U.S. qualified pension plan is based on strategic asset allocation of the plan, long-term capital market return expectations, and expected performance from active investment management. For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2023 is 7.50%, an increase from 6.00% in 2022. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. The weighted average expected return for the international pension plans is 4.61% for 2023 compared to 3.86% for 2022. Changes in asset allocation and market performance over time, among other factors, cause these estimates to be subject to uncertainty.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248 million related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million, down from $206 million in 2021.\nIn 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of approximately $145 million, a decrease of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nAssessments of Goodwill:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of goodwill. As of December 31, 2022, 3M goodwill totaled approximately $12.8 billion. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year and is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. If future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3M would expect that only a portion of the goodwill would be impaired.\nImpairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, and the loss would equal that difference. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples. 3M also performs a discounted cash flow analysis for certain reporting units where the market approach indicates additional review is warranted. A discounted cash flow analysis involves key assumptions including projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in reporting unit earnings, comparable company information, and expected future cash flows, as well as underlying market and overall economic conditions, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2022 completed as of October 1, 2022, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2022, 3M had 21 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3Ms businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3Ms focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3Ms value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\nFollowing the annual impairment test, as a result of 3M's December 2022 announced commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Notes 4 and 15, 3M tested the Advanced Materials and Electronics Materials Solutions reporting units (within the Transportation and Electronics business) for impairment resulting in a goodwill impairment charge related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit.\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2023 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\nAssessments of Long-Lived Assets:\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments in impairment assessments of long-lived assets. As discussed in Note 1, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the asset groups carrying value over its fair value. As discussed in Notes 4 and 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge related to impairment of long-lived assets. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models. Key assumptions included projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates. Changes in underlying market and overall economic conditions, including changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences; operational execution of activities associated with these asset groupings; and items mentioned in Item 1A - Risk Factors with respect to 3Ms exit of PFAS manufacturing, among other factors, make these estimates subject to uncertainty.\nUncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\nThe extent of 3Ms operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes, a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nThe strength and stability of 3Ms business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provide financial flexibility to deploy capital in accordance with the Company's stated priorities and meet needs associated with contractual commitments and other obligations. Investing in 3Ms business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Companys primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3Ms commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\nTotal debt:\nThe strength of 3Ms credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Companys debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of December 2022, 3M has a credit rating of A1, stable outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A+, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\nThe Companys total debt was lower at December 31, 2022 when compared to December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBORs administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023. The Company has reviewed its debt securities, bank facilities, derivative instruments, and commercial contracts that may utilize LIBOR as the reference rate. Contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable.\nEffective February 10, 2020, the Company updated its well-known seasoned issuer (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3Ms previous shelf registration dated February 24, 2017. In May 2016, in connection with the WKSI shelf, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Companys medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of December 31, 2022, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 12.\nAs disclosed in Note 12, 3M had debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities:\nAt December 31, 2022, 3M had $3.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $2.7 billion was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and approximately $1.2 billion was held in the United States. These balances are invested in bank instruments and other high-quality fixed income securities. At December 31, 2021, 3M had $4.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which approximately $3.1 billion was held by the Companys foreign subsidiaries and $1.7 billion was held by the United States. The decrease from December 31, 2021 primarily resulted from cash flow from operations and Food Safety transaction-related cash consideration and earlier borrowings (see Note 3) offset by ongoing dividend payments, purchases of treasury stock, capital expenditures, and the fixed-rate medium-term note maturities in 2022.\nNet Debt (non-GAAP measure):\nNet debt is not defined under U.S. GAAP and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines net debt as total debt less the total of cash, cash equivalents and current and long-term marketable securities. 3M believes net debt is meaningful to investors as 3M considers net debt and its components to be important indicators of liquidity and financial position. The following table provides net debt as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nDecember 31,\n(Millions) 2022 2021 Change\nTotal debt $ 15,939 $ 17,363 $ (1,424)\nLess: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 3,916 4,792 (876)\nNet debt (non-GAAP measure) $ 12,023 $ 12,571 $ (548)\nRefer to the preceding Total Debt and Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities sections for additional details.\nBalance Sheet:\n3Ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the Company with significant flexibility to fund its numerous opportunities going forward. The Company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities.\nThe Company uses working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets, such as accounts receivable and inventory activity.\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure):\nDecember 31,\n(Millions) 2022 2021 Change\nCurrent assets $ 14,688 $ 15,403 $ (715)\nLess: Current liabilities 9,523 9,035 488\nWorking capital (non-GAAP measure) $ 5,165 $ 6,368 $ (1,203)\nVarious assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. Working capital is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines working capital as current assets minus current liabilities. 3M believes working capital is meaningful to investors as a measure of operational efficiency and short-term financial health.\nWorking capital decreased $1.2 billion compared with December 31, 2021. Balance changes in current assets decreased working capital by $0.7 billion, driven largely by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Balance changes in current liabilities decreased working capital by $0.5 billion, primarily due to increases in short-term borrowings and current-portion of long-term debt offset by decreases in accrued payroll.\nInventory increased $387 million from December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increased underlying operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts. Current portion of long-term debt increased as upcoming debt maturities now considered current were partially offset by the bond maturities in 2022, while accounts payable also increased as a result of increased sequential operating activity partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts.\nCash Flows:\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. Individual amounts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. Thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities:\nYear ended December 31, (Millions) 2022 2021\nNet income including noncontrolling interest $ 5,791 $ 5,929\nDepreciation and amortization 1,831 1,915\nLong-lived and indefinite-lived asset impairment expense 618 -\nGoodwill impairment expense 271 -\nCompany pension and postretirement contributions (158) (180)\nCompany pension and postretirement expense 178 206\nStock-based compensation expense 263 274\nGain on business divestitures (2,724) -\nIncome taxes (deferred and accrued income taxes) (710) (410)\nAccounts receivable (105) (122)\nInventories (629) (903)\nAccounts payable 111 518\nOther - net 854 227\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,591 $ 7,454\nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as working capital movements, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows.\nIn 2022, cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $1,863 million compared to the same period last year, with this decrease primarily due to lower net income and the cash impact from capitalization of R&D for U.S. tax purposes. The combination of accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable decreased operating cash flow by $623 million in 2022, compared to an operating cash flow decrease of $507 million in 2021. Additional discussion on working capital changes is provided earlier in the Financial Condition and Liquidity section. The 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) largely impacted the 2022 net income component above, with offsets in the other-net and deferred tax elements. The 2022 non-cash impairment expenses added back to net income in arriving at net cash provided by operating activities above primarily relate to 3M's commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Note 15.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nYear ended December 31, (Millions) 2022 2021\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) $ (1,749) $ (1,603)\nProceeds from sale of PP&E and other assets 200 51\nPurchases and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, net 11 204\nProceeds from sale of businesses, net of cash sold 13 -\nCash payment from Food Safety business split-off, net of divested cash 478 -\nOther - net 1 31\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,046) $ (1,317)\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. The Company expects 2023 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\n3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures (including the cash payment from the Food Safety business split-off). The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3Ms diversified marketable securities portfolio. Purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance, plus investments in equity securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nYear ended December 31, (Millions) 2022 2021\nChange in short-term debt - net $ 340 $ (2)\nRepayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) (1,179) (1,144)\nProceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) 1 1\nTotal cash change in debt (838) (1,145)\nPurchases of treasury stock (1,464) (2,199)\nProceeds from issuances of treasury stock pursuant to stock option and benefit plans 381 639\nDividends paid to shareholders (3,369) (3,420)\nOther - net (60) (20)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (5,350) $ (6,145)\n2022 Debt Activity:\nTotal debt was approximately $15.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $17.4 billion at December 31, 2021. Decreases in debt were largely due to the repayments of 500 million euros and $600 million aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate medium-term notes in February 2022 and June 2022, respectively. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In conjunction with the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3), the associated non-cash debt-for-debt exchange in the third quarter of 2022 reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness of $350 million (borrowed earlier in the year) which became new term-debt obligations of Neogen. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in Change in short-term debt - net in the preceding table. 3Ms primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. Refer to Note 12 for more detail regarding debt.\n2021 Debt Activity:\nDecreases in debt were largely due to the March 2021 early redemption of $450 million in debt maturing in 2022 via make-whole call offers and the November 2021 repayment of 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured. The Company had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Net commercial paper issuances in addition to repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries are largely reflected in Change in short-term debt - net in the preceding table.\nRepurchases of Common Stock:\nRepurchases of common stock are made to support the Companys stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In 2022, the Company purchased $1,464 million of its own stock. For more information, refer to the table titled Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the Companys stock.\nDividends Paid to Shareholders:\n3M has paid dividends since 1916. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This is equivalent to an annual dividend of $6.00 per share and marked the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nOther cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as cash paid associated with certain derivative instruments, distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in overdraft balances, and principal payments for finance leases.\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure):\nFree cash flow and free cash flow conversion are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Therefore, they should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. The Company defines free cash flow conversion as free cash flow divided by net income attributable to 3M. The Company believes free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are meaningful to investors as they are useful measures of performance and the Company uses these measures as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion vary across quarters throughout the year. Below find a recap of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion.\nRefer to the preceding Cash Flows from Operating Activities and Cash Flows from Investing Activities sections for discussion of items that impacted the operating cash flow and purchases of PP&E components of the calculation of free cash flow. Refer to the preceding Results of Operations section for discussion of items that impacted the net income attributable to 3M component of the calculation of free cash flow conversion.\nYear ended December 31, (Millions) 2022 2021\nMajor GAAP Cash Flow Categories\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,591 $ 7,454\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,046) (1,317)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (5,350) (6,145)\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 5,591 $ 7,454\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment (1,749) (1,603)\nFree cash flow 3,842 5,851\nNet income attributable to 3M $ 5,777 $ 5,921\nFree cash flow conversion 66 % 99 %\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations:\n3Ms material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to following, for which information on both a short-term and long-term basis is provided in the indicated notes to the consolidated financial statements:\nTax obligations-Refer to Note 10.\nDebt-Refer to Note 12. Future cash payments for interest on long-term debt is approximately $6 billion.\nCommitments and contingencies-Refer to Note 16.\nOperating and finance leases-Refer to Note 17.\n3M purchases the majority of its materials and services as needed, with no unconditional commitments. In limited circumstances, in the normal course of business, 3M enters into unconditional purchase obligations with various vendors that may take the form of, for example, take or pay contracts in which 3M guarantees payment to ensure availability to 3M of certain materials or services or to ensure ongoing efforts on capital projects. The Company expects to receive underlying materials or services for these purchase obligations. To the extent the limited amount of these purchase obligations fluctuates, it largely trends with normal-course changes in regular operating activities. Additionally, contractual capital commitments represent a small part of the Companys expected capital spending.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The Company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\nRefer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for further discussion of foreign exchange rates risk, interest rates risk, commodity prices risk and value at risk analysis. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the context of Item 7A, 3M is exposed to market risk due to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Senior management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. Senior management also establishes certain associated procedures relative to control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\nForeign Exchange Rates Risk:\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. 3M is also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months. In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. As circumstances warrant, the Company also uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge portions of the Companys net investments in foreign operations. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Companys foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as either cash flow hedges or net investment hedges was $3.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Companys foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, the Company had \u20ac2.4 billion in principal amount of foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges as discussed in Note 14 in the Net Investment Hedges section.\nInterest Rates Risk:\nThe Company may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances. 3M manages interest rate risk and expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. In addition, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the Companys interest rate swaps at December 31, 2022 was $800 million. Additional details about 3Ms long-term debt can be found in Note 12, including references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments, further discussed in Note 14, associated with the Companys long-term debt.\nCommodity Prices Risk:\nThe Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements.\nValue At Risk:\nThe value at risk analysis is performed annually to assess the Companys sensitivity to changes in currency rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation technique was used to test the impact on after-tax earnings related to debt instruments, interest rate derivatives and underlying foreign exchange and commodity exposures outstanding at December 31, 2022. The model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. This model does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the Company. The following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.\nAdverse impact on after-tax earnings Positive impact on after-tax earnings\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021\nForeign exchange rates $ (315) $ (140) $ 314 $ 147\nInterest rates (18) (2) 18 2\nCommodity prices (5) (21) 7 14\nAn analysis of the global exposures related to purchased components and materials is performed at each year-end. A one percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $85 million per year. The global energy exposure is such that a ten percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $45 million per year. Global energy exposure includes energy costs used in 3M production and other facilities, primarily electricity and natural gas. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nA complete summary of Form 10-K content, including the index to financial statements, is found at the beginning of this document.\nManagements Responsibility for Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this report. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Where necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates based on managements judgment.\nManagement has established and maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its subsidiaries. This system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. The Companys system of internal control over financial reporting is supported by widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of Company affairs. Internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.\n3M Company\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. Management conducted an assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nThe Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n3M Company\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 3M Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of 3M Company and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, management records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, management records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. Management either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. Management discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if management believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to legal proceedings is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when estimating the loss or range of loss for each claim, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements assessment of the liabilities and disclosures associated with legal proceedings.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements evaluation of the liability related to legal proceedings, including controls over determining the likelihood of a loss and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, obtaining and evaluating contracts and agreements, evaluating the reasonableness of managements assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Companys disclosures related to legal proceedings.\nTax-free Determination of the Split-Off of the Food Safety Division\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the split-off of the Food Safety Division business in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure. Management has determined that the Food Safety Division split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions (the split-off and certain internal business separation transactions referred to together as the Transactions) qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, management applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed Transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations in determining the Transactions qualify as tax-free, and (ii) the significant impact to the financial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of the Transactions. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements determination of the tax-free treatment of the Transactions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the information, including the private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, U.S. federal tax law, other external tax advice, certain representations from management, and other relevant evidence used by management, as well as the application of relevant U.S. federal tax law to support managements determination that the Transactions qualify as tax-free.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Goodwill Impairment Assessments for the Advanced Materials Division\nAs described in Notes 1, 4, and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated property, plant and equipment balance was $9.2 billion and goodwill balance was $12.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, and the Advanced Materials Division makes up a portion of these balances. Management tests property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Management also tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. In December 2022, the Company committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to the impairment of long-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion) for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rate and other applicable items.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, which in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the appropriateness of managements discounted cash flow models and reasonableness of managements significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment assessments for the Advanced Materials Division, including controls over managements identification of events or changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment of an asset group or reporting unit has occurred and controls over the determination of the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, testing managements process for determining the fair value estimates of the Advanced Materials Division asset group and reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models, and evaluating the reasonableness of managements significant assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rate. Evaluating managements assumptions related to projected sales, EBITDA margins, and capital expenditures involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the Advanced Materials Division, external market and industry data, evidence obtained in other areas of the audit and the Companys objectives and strategies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nFebruary 8, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1975.\n3M Company and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nYears ended December 31\n(Millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020\nNet sales $ 34,229 $ 35,355 $ 32,184\nOperating expenses\nCost of sales 19,232 18,795 16,605\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 9,049 7,197 6,929\nResearch, development and related expenses 1,862 1,994 1,878\nGain on business divestitures (2,724) -

Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation: 3M is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. All applicable subsidiaries are consolidated. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. As used herein, the term 3M or Company refers to 3M Company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.\n3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022. See additional information in Note 16.\nBasis of presentation: Certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, 3M made changes in the measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker-impacting 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income). See additional information in Note 19. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of the changes in segment reporting. See additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nForeign currency translation: Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the United States. Exceptions include 3Ms subsidiaries in Argentina and, beginning in the second quarter of 2022, in Turkey, the economy of which also became highly inflationary. The operating income and balances of underlying net monetary assets denominated in Turkish lira are not material to 3M. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are remeasured as if their functional currency is that of their parent. Assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at month-end exchange rates of the period reported. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company considered the coronavirus (COVID-19) related impacts on its estimates, as appropriate, within its consolidated financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. 3M believes that the accounting estimates are appropriate after giving consideration to the increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such estimates and assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainties which may result in actual amounts differing from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nMarketable securities: Marketable securities include available-for-sale debt securities and are recorded at fair value. Cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt Securities and ASC 326-30, Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, when determining whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. A change in the allowance for credit losses is recorded into earnings in the period of the change. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders equity. The factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. When a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or a change in the portions of impairment related to credit losses and not related to credit losses.\nInvestments: All equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, medical equipment in rental arrangements utilized primarily by hospitals and other medical clinics, prepaid pension and postretirement and other long-term assets. Investments in life insurance policies are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in Purchases of marketable securities and investments and Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments, respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $177 million and $176 millions at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but are required to be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3M did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting units net assets exceeds its estimated fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined based on a market approach using comparable company information such as EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) multiples or, in some cases, based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Companies have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is not more likely than not less than its carrying amount, which is commonly referred to as Step 0. 3M has chosen not to apply Step 0 for its annual goodwill assessments.\nIntangible assets: Intangible asset types include customer related, patents, other technology-based, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized over a period ranging from six to twenty years on a systematic and rational basis (generally straight line) that is representative of the assets use. The estimated useful lives vary by category, with customer-related largely between twelve to nineteen years, patents largely between eight to thirteen years, other technology-based largely between six to ten years, definite lived tradenames largely between eleven and twenty years, and other intangibles largely ten years. Intangible assets are removed from their respective gross asset and accumulated amortization accounts when they are no longer in use. Refer to Note 4 for additional details on the gross amount and accumulated amortization of the Companys intangible assets. Costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, within Research, development and related expenses.\nIntangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows from the assets or asset groups ongoing use and eventual disposition. If an impairment is identified, the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.\nIntangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of each year, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nRestructuring actions: Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment or accelerated depreciation/amortization of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Severance amounts for which affected employees in certain circumstances are required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods. Contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the Company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the Company.\nRevenue (sales) recognition: The Company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk or significant payment terms extended to customers. The vast majority of 3Ms customer arrangements contain a single performance obligation to transfer manufactured goods as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct. However, to a limited extent 3M also enters into customer arrangements that involve intellectual property out-licensing, multiple performance obligations (such as equipment, installation and service), software with coterminous post-contract support, services and non-standard terms and conditions.\nThe Company recognizes revenue in light of the guidance of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when control of goods has transferred to customers. For the majority of the Companys customer arrangements, control transfers to customers at a point-in-time when goods/services have been delivered as that is generally when legal title, physical possession and risks and rewards of goods/services transfer to the customer. In limited arrangements, control transfers over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as 3M completes the performance obligation(s).\nRevenue is recognized at the transaction price which the Company expects to be entitled. When determining the transaction price, 3M estimates variable consideration applying the portfolio approach practical expedient under ASC 606. The main sources of variable consideration for 3M are customer rebates, trade promotion funds, and cash discounts. These sales incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of the initial sale using the most-likely amount estimation method. The most-likely amount method is based on the single most likely outcome from a range of possible consideration outcomes. The range of possible consideration outcomes are primarily derived from the following inputs: sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served. Because 3M serves numerous markets, the sales incentive programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. There are no material instances where variable consideration is constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale. Free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. Product returns are recorded as a reduction to revenue based on anticipated sales returns that occur in the normal course of business. 3M primarily has assurance-type warranties that do not result in separate performance obligations. Sales, use, value-added, and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue. The Company has elected to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation using 3Ms best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract.\nThe Company did not recognize any material revenue in the current reporting period for performance obligations that were fully satisfied in previous periods.\nThe Company does not have material unfulfilled performance obligation balances for contracts with an original length greater than one year in any years presented. Additionally, the Company does not have material costs related to obtaining a contract with amortization periods greater than one year for any year presented.\n3M applies ASC 606 utilizing the following allowable exemptions or practical expedients:\nExemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligation balance for contracts with an original length of one year or less.\nPractical expedient relative to costs of obtaining a contract by expensing sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less.\nPortfolio approach practical expedient relative to estimation of variable consideration.\nRight to invoice practical expedient based on 3Ms right to invoice the customer at an amount that reasonably represents the value to the customer of 3Ms performance completed to date.\nElection to present revenue net of sales taxes and other similar taxes.\nSales-based royalty exemption permitting future intellectual property out-licensing royalty payments to be excluded from the otherwise required remaining performance obligations disclosure\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the rental of durable medical devices in accordance with the guidance of ASC 842, Leases. The Company recognizes rental revenue based on the length of time a device is used by the patient/organization, (i) at the contracted rental rate for contracted customers and (ii) generally, retail price for non-contracted customers. The leases are short-term in nature, generally providing for daily or monthly pricing, and are all classified as operating leases.\nAccounts receivable and allowances: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, and various other items. The allowances for bad debts and cash discounts are based on the best estimate of the amount of expected credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated cash discounts. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience, current expectations of future credit losses informed by industry and regional economic data, and historical cash discounts. The Company reviews the allowances monthly. The allowances for bad debts as well as the provision for credit losses, write-off activity and recoveries for the periods presented are not material. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Company has long-term customer receivables that do not have significant credit risk, and the origination dates of which are typically not older than five years. These long-term receivables are subject to an allowance methodology similar to other receivables.\nAdvertising and merchandising: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $323 million, $327 million and $278 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch, development and related expenses: These costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related expenses primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures.\nInternal-use software: The Company capitalizes direct costs of services used in the development of, and external software acquired for use as, internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the softwares use. Amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or finance leases within property, plant and equipment. Fully depreciated internal-use software assets are removed from property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts.\nEnvironmental: Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Companys commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had valuation allowances of $115 million and $142 million on its deferred tax assets, respectively. The Company recognizes and measures its uncertain tax positions based on the rules under ASC 740, Income Taxes.\nEarnings per share: The difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the Companys stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (30.3 million average options for 2022, 7.8 million average options for 2021, and 18.1 million average options for 2020). The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share follow:\nEarnings Per Share Computations\n(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to 3M $ 5,777 $ 5,921 $ 5,449\nDenominator:\nDenominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding - basic\n566.0 579.0 577.6\nDilution associated with the Companys stock-based compensation plans 1.6 6.3 4.6\nDenominator for weighted average 3M common shares outstanding - diluted\n567.6 585.3 582.2\nEarnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - basic\n$ 10.21 $ 10.23 $ 9.43\nEarnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders - diluted\n$ 10.18 $ 10.12 $ 9.36\nStock-based compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. However, with respect to income taxes, the related deduction from taxes payable is based on the awards intrinsic value at the time of exercise (for an option) or on the fair value upon vesting of the award (for RSUs), which can be either greater (creating an excess tax benefit) or less (creating a tax deficiency) than the deferred tax benefit recognized as compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements. These excess tax benefits/deficiencies are recognized as income tax benefit/expense in the statement of income and, within the statement of cash flows, are classified in operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. The extent of excess tax benefits/deficiencies is subject to variation in 3M stock price and timing/extent of RSU vestings and employee stock option exercises.\nComprehensive income: Total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.\nDerivatives and hedging activities: All derivative instruments within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate volatility. All hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. Instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.\nCredit risk: The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts. However, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Companys consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation.\nFair value measurements: 3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Companys assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. In addition to business combinations, 3M periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. These transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.\nLeases: 3M determines if an arrangement is a lease upon inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an asset includes the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the underlying asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used. 3M determines certain service agreements that contain the right to use an underlying asset are not leases because 3M does not control how and for what purpose the identified asset is used. Examples of such agreements include master supply agreements, product processing agreements, warehouse and distribution services agreements, power purchase agreements, and transportation purchase agreements.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is 3Ms incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. 3M determines the incremental borrowing rate for leases using a portfolio approach based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nAs a lessee, the Company leases distribution centers, office space, land, and equipment. Certain 3M lease agreements include rental payments adjusted annually based on changes in an inflation index. 3Ms leases do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCertain leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend the lease term up to five years. 3M includes options to renew the lease as part of the right of use lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. In addition, certain leases contain fair value purchase and termination options with an associated penalty. In general, 3M is not reasonably certain to exercise such options.\nFor the measurement and classification of its lease agreements, 3M groups lease and non-lease components into a single lease component for all underlying asset classes. Variable lease payments primarily include payments for non-lease components, such as maintenance costs, payments for leased assets used beyond their noncancellable lease term as adjusted for contractual options to terminate or renew, additional payments related to a subsequent adjustment in an inflation index, and payments for non-components such as sales tax. Certain 3M leases contain immaterial variable lease payments based on number of units produced.\nRelated Party Activity:\nOther than the amounts due by and between the Aearo Entities and related entities (as described in Note 16), 3M does not have any material related party activity.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nThe table below provides summaries of applicable new accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet adopted by 3M:\nStandards Issued and Not Yet Adopted\nStandard Relevant Description Effective Date for 3M Impact and Other Matters\nASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\nIssued in October 2021. Requires acquiring entities to apply ASC 606 to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired through a business combination. January 1, 2023 This guidance is applicable to all business combinations occurring after the effective date.\nASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Obligations\nIssued in September 2022. Requires a buyer in a supplier finance program to disclose the key terms of the program, amount of outstanding obligations, and a rollforward of obligations confirmed and subsequently paid. January 1, 2023, except rollforward disclosure which is not effective until the year-end December 31, 2024 As this ASU relates to disclosures only, there will be no impact to 3Ms consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nNOTE 2. Revenue\nContract Balances:\nDeferred revenue primarily relates to revenue that is recognized over time for one-year software license contracts. Refer to Note 7 for deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Approximately $500 million of the December 31, 2021 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, while approximately $470 million of the December 31, 2020 balance was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOperating Lease Revenue:\nNet sales includes rental revenue from durable medical devices as part of operating lease arrangements (reported within the Medical Solutions Division), which was $577 million, $582 million, and $586 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 respectively.\nDisaggregated revenue information:\nThe Company views the following disaggregated disclosures as useful to understanding the composition of revenue recognized during the respective reporting periods:\nYear ended December 31,\nNet Sales (Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nAbrasives $ 1,343 $ 1,296 $ 1,077\nAutomotive Aftermarket 1,209 1,164 1,028\nClosure and Masking Systems 1,046 1,033 993\nElectrical Markets 1,304 1,229 1,093\nIndustrial Adhesives and Tapes 2,331 2,353 2,000\nPersonal Safety 3,916 4,470 4,408\nRoofing Granules 455 428 389\nOther Safety and Industrial - 8 (16)\nTotal Safety and Industrial Business Segment 11,604 11,981 10,972\nAdvanced Materials 1,205 1,200 1,029\nAutomotive and Aerospace 1,754 1,756 1,522\nCommercial Solutions 1,751 1,717 1,486\nElectronics 3,359 3,673 3,497\nTransportation Safety 833 907 880\nOther Transportation and Electronics - 9 (8)\nTotal Transportation and Electronics Business Segment 8,902 9,262 8,406\nDrug Delivery - - 146\nFood Safety 244 368 337\nHealth Information Systems 1,259 1,220 1,140\nMedical Solutions 4,581 4,632 4,288\nOral Care 1,353 1,420 1,071\nSeparation and Purification Sciences 960 956 848\nOther Health Care 24 1 2\nTotal Health Care Business Group 8,421 8,597 7,832\nConsumer Health and Safety 569 588 540\nHome Care 1,046 1,074 1,043\nHome Improvement 2,392 2,548 2,260\nStationery and Office 1,291 1,306 1,132\nOther Consumer - (3) 1\nTotal Consumer Business Group 5,298 5,513 4,976\nCorporate and Unallocated 4 2 (2)\nTotal Company $ 34,229 $ 35,355 $ 32,184\nYear ended December 31,\nNet Sales (Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nAmericas $ 18,400 $ 18,097 $ 16,525\nAsia Pacific 9,901 10,600 9,569\nEurope, Middle East and Africa 5,928 6,660 6,109\nOther Unallocated - (2) (19)\nWorldwide $ 34,229 $ 35,355 $ 32,184\nAmericas included United States net sales to customers of $15.0 billion, $15.0 billion and $13.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Asia Pacific included China/Hong Kong net sales to customers of $3.8 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions:\n3M makes acquisitions of certain businesses from time to time that are aligned with its strategic intent with respect to, among other factors, growth markets and adjacent product lines or technologies. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3Ms acquisition of these businesses.\n2022 acquisitions:\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n2021 acquisitions:\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 acquisitions:\nThere were no acquisitions that closed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDivestitures:\n3M may divest certain businesses from time to time based upon review of the Companys portfolio considering, among other items, factors relative to the extent of strategic and technological alignment and optimization of capital deployment, in addition to considering if selling the businesses results in the greatest value creation for the Company and for shareholders. As discussed in Note 19 (Business Segments), gains/losses on business divestitures are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n2022 divestitures and previously announced divestitures:\nIn March 2022, 3M completed the sale of its floor products business in Western Europe, formerly part of the Consumer business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the business's book value.\nIn July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company. 3M expects to initially retain an ownership position of 19.9% in the business, which 3M intends to monetize over time. The Company expects to complete the transaction, which is intended to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, by year-end 2023. The transaction is subject to customary conditions, including final approval from the 3M Board of Directors, regulatory approvals and rulings, and satisfactory completion of financing, among other items. Because the intended transaction is a spin-off, the Health Care business is not classified as held for sale.\nIn September 2022, 3M completed the split-off and combination of its Food Safety Division business (formerly part of the Health Care business segment) with Neogen Corporation in a transaction that involved a Reverse Morris Trust structure intended to make the split-off tax-efficient to 3M and 3M's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of the transaction, 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $2.7 billion based on aggregate consideration of $2.8 billion. Under the terms of the underlying agreements, aggregate consideration included 3M shares exchanged and $1.0 billion ($828 million after closing and other adjustments) funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen. The cash and non-cash consideration components are further described below.\n$2.0 billion representing the value of 16 million 3M common shares accepted by 3M that reduced shares outstanding through a fully-subscribed exchange offer. The exchange ultimately resulted in subscribed 3M shareholders owning 50.1% of the common shares of Neogen.\n$828 million in cash and non-cash components funded from debt that became obligations of Neogen.\n\u25e6$478 million, net of divested cash, as a cash payment to 3M funded from Food Safety business borrowings coincident with the transaction that became obligations of Neogen. This amount is reflected in the investing section on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The amount was subject to closing and other adjustments and included cash paid to 3M for direct sales of certain net assets of the Food Safety business to Neogen.\n\u25e6$350 million as part of a non-cash debt-for-debt exchange that reduced then-outstanding 3M commercial paper indebtedness and became new term-debt obligations of Neogen.\n3M determined that the split-off involving the Reverse Morris Trust structure and certain internal business separation transactions qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In making these determinations, 3M applied U.S. federal tax law to relevant facts and circumstances and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, third party tax opinions, and other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. The applicable facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the Reverse Morris Trust split-off transactions may be reviewed as part of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. If the completed transactions were later determined to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nNet sales information relative to the Food Safety Division is included in Note 2. Neogen and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition supply, manufacturing and services and into certain longer-term commercial supply and distributor arrangements.\n2021 divestitures:\nThere were no divestitures that closed during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 divestitures:\nIn January 2020, 3M completed the sale of its advanced ballistic-protection business, formerly part of the Transportation and Electronics business, to Avon Rubber p.l.c for $86 million in cash and recognized certain contingent consideration from the outcome of pending tenders. Further contingent consideration of less than $25 million may be recognized depending on outcomes in the future. The business, with annual sales of approximately $85 million, consists of ballistic helmets, body armor, flat armor and related helmet-attachment products serving government and law enforcement. 3M reflected immaterial impacts in the third quarter of 2019 as a result of measuring this disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and in the first quarter 2020 related to completion of the divestiture and recognition of contingent consideration.\nIn May 2020, 3M completed the sale of substantially all of its Drug Delivery Division business, formerly part of the Health Care business, to an affiliate of Altaris Capital Partners, LLC for $617 million in consideration including $487 million of cash, approximately $70 million in the form of an interest-bearing security, and approximately $60 million in the form of a 17 percent noncontrolling interest in the new company, Kindeva Drug Delivery (Kindeva). Non-cash consideration was valued at time of initial recognition on an income-based approach using relevant estimated future cash flows and applicable market interest rates while considering impacts of restrictions related to transferability. The divested business had annual sales of approximately $380 million. 3M retained its transdermal drug delivery components business. 3M reflected a pre-tax gain of $387 million as a result of the divestiture. The Company reflected its ownership interest in Kindeva using the equity method of accounting incorporating the recording of 3Ms share of earnings/losses on a lag-basis based on availability of Kindeva financial statements. As a result, income/loss from this unconsolidated subsidiary began to be reflected in 3Ms financial statements in the third quarter of 2020. Kindeva and 3M entered into certain limited-term agreements related to post-divestiture transition and supply services. In the fourth quarter of 2022, 3M sold its remaining ownership interest in Kindeva resulting in an immaterial gain.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, 3M completed the sale of a small dermatology products business, formerly part of the Health Care business, for immaterial proceeds that approximated the businesss book value.\nOperating income and held-for-sale amounts:\nWith respect to the businesses above, operating income information of the Health Care business segment, inclusive of the Food Safety Division and Drug Delivery Division, is included in Note 19. Further, with the respect to these businesses, there were immaterial amounts of assets and liabilities associated with disposal groups classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2021 and no such amounts as of December 31, 2022. Information related to other held-for-sale disposal groups is included in Note 15.\nNOTE 4. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThere was no goodwill recorded from acquisitions during 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the Translation and other column in the following table primarily relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe goodwill balance by business segment follows:\n(Millions) Safety and Industrial Transportation and Electronics Health Care Consumer Total Company\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 4,687 $ 1,858 $ 6,992 $ 265 $ 13,802\nTranslation and other (65) (33) (206) (12) (316)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 4,622 $ 1,825 $ 6,786 $ 253 $ 13,486\nDivestiture activity - - (16) - (16)\nGoodwill impairment - (271) - - (271)\nTranslation and other (113) (53) (255) 12 (409)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 $ 4,509 $ 1,501 $ 6,515 $ 265 $ 12,790\nAccounting standards require that goodwill be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a change in reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. At 3M, reporting units correspond to a division.\nAs described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2022, the Company changed its business segment reporting. For any product changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the Company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting units, the results of which were immaterial. Goodwill balances reported above reflect these business segment reporting changes in the earliest period presented. The Company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. Additionally, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing as described in Note 15, 3M recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $0.3 billion related to the Advanced Materials reporting unit (within the Transportation and Electronics business) resulting in no remaining goodwill for that reporting unit. This also represents the Company's accumulated goodwill impairment losses as of December 31, 2022.\nAcquired Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired finite-lived intangible assets, in addition to the balance of non-amortizable intangible assets follow:\nDecember 31,\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nCustomer related intangible assets $ 4,062 $ 4,216\nPatents 426 513\nOther technology-based intangible assets 2,081 2,111\nDefinite-lived tradenames 1,166 1,171\nOther amortizable intangible assets 84 105\nTotal gross carrying amount 7,819 8,116\nAccumulated amortization - customer related (1,747) (1,616)\nAccumulated amortization - patents (421) (500)\nAccumulated amortization - other technology-based (1,000) (839)\nAccumulated amortization - definite-lived tradenames (509) (447)\nAccumulated amortization - other (60) (79)\nTotal accumulated amortization (3,737) (3,481)\nTotal finite-lived intangible assets - net 4,082 4,635\nNon-amortizable intangible assets (primarily tradenames) 617 653\nTotal intangible assets - net $ 4,699 $ 5,288\nCertain tradenames acquired by 3M are not amortized because they have been in existence for over 60 years, have a history of leading-market share positions, have been and are intended to be continuously renewed, and the associated products of which are expected to generate cash flows for 3M for an indefinite period of time.\nAs discussed in Note 15, in December 2022, as a result of 3M's commitment to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing, 3M recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to impairment of long-lived assets and an immaterial charge related to impairment of indefinite-lived assets.\nAmortization expense follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nAmortization expense $ 498 $ 529 $ 537\nExpected amortization expense for acquired amortizable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2022 follows:\n(Millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 After 2027\nAmortization expense $ 479 $ 451 $ 421 $ 415 $ 390 $ 1,926\nThe preceding expected amortization expense is an estimate. Actual amounts of amortization expense may differ from estimated amounts due to additional intangible asset acquisitions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, impairment of intangible assets, accelerated amortization of intangible assets and other events. 3M expenses the costs incurred to renew or extend the term of intangible assets.\nNOTE 5. Restructuring Actions\n2020 through 2022 Restructuring Action\nOperational/Marketing Capability Restructuring:\nIn late 2020, 3M announced it would undertake certain actions beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020 to further enhance its operations and marketing capabilities to take advantage of certain global market trends while de-prioritizing investments in slower-growth end markets, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $137 million. In 2021, management approved and committed to undertake additional actions under this initiative resulting in a 2021 pre-tax charge of $124 million. In the first quarter of 2022, management approved and committed to undertake the remaining actions under this initiative resulting in a pre-tax charge of $18 million. This initiative, beginning in 2020 and ending with committed first quarter 2022 actions, impacted approximately 3,100 positions worldwide with a pre-tax charge of approximately $280 million over that period.

See Note 7 Supplemental Balance Sheet Information for further details.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had tax effected operating losses, capital losses, and tax credit carryovers for federal (approximately $112 million), state (approximately $79 million), and international (approximately $40 million), with all amounts before limitation impacts and valuation allowances. Federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after one to ten years, the state after one to eleven years, and the international after one year to an indefinite carryover period. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has provided $115 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on managements determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized.\nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate\n2022 2021 2020\nStatutory U.S. tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nFood Safety divestiture (8.4) - -\nState income taxes - net of federal benefit - 0.9 1.2\nInternational income taxes - net (0.4) (1.2) (1.2)\nGlobal Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) 0.7 0.7 0.8\nForeign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (2.3) (3.1) (1.8)\nU.S. research and development credit (1.0) (0.7) (1.0)\nReserves for tax contingencies - 0.6 0.5\nEmployee share-based payments (0.2) (0.6) (0.5)\nAll other - net 0.2 0.2 0.7\nEffective worldwide tax rate 9.6 % 17.8 % 19.7 %\nThe effective tax rate for 2022, 2021, and 2020 were 9.6 percent, 17.8 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 8.2 percentage points from 2021 to 2022 and a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021. The primary factor that decreased the effective tax rate for 2022 was the tax efficient structure associated with the gain on the split-off of the Food Safety business. The primary factors that decreased the effective tax rate for 2021 in comparison to 2020 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) involved a transition tax that is payable over eight years beginning in 2018. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $380 million and $508 million, respectively, in long term income taxes payable. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, 3M reflected $126 million and $68 million, respectively, payable within one year associated with the transition tax.\nThe IRS has completed its field examination of the Companys U.S. federal income tax returns through 2018, but the years 2005 through 2017 have not closed as the Company is in the process of resolving issues identified during those examinations. In addition to the U.S. federal examination, there is also audit activity in several U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions where the Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments, which could be impacted by evolving political environments in those jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, no taxing authority proposed significant adjustments to the Companys tax positions for which the Company is not adequately reserved.\nIt is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. These uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted in light of facts and circumstances including progression of tax audits, developments in case law and closing statutes of limitation. At this time, the Company is not able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3Ms unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\nThe Company recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) is as follows:\nFederal, State and Foreign Tax\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nGross UTB Balance at January 1 $ 1,071 $ 1,113 $ 1,167\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 115 91 74\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 36 22 106\nAdditions related to recent acquisitions - - -\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (138) (60) (173)\nSettlements (118) (57) (8)\nReductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations (39) (38) (53)\nGross UTB Balance at December 31 $ 927 $ 1,071 $ 1,113\nNet UTB that would impact the effective tax rate at December 31 $ 965 $ 1,112 $ 1,145\nThe total amount of UTB, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $965 million as of December 31, 2022, $1,112 million as of December 31, 2021, and $1,145 million as of December 31, 2020. The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $1 million of expense, $14 million of expense, and $21 million of expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $116 million and $140 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain foreign operations in the following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2022), Switzerland (2026), Brazil (2029) and Singapore (2032). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $170 million (30 cents per diluted share) in 2022, $204 million (36 cents per diluted share) in 2021, and $163 million (28 cents per diluted share) in 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $16.0 billion of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $8.0 billion of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to repatriate these earnings to the US is immaterial. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $8.0 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.\nNOTE 11. Marketable Securities\nThe Company invests in asset-backed securities, certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities. The following is a summary of amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for marketable securities (current and non-current).\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nCommercial paper $ 213 $ 109\nCertificates of deposit/time deposits 21 14\nU.S. treasury securities - 75\nU.S. municipal securities 4 3\nCurrent marketable securities 238 201\nU.S. municipal securities 23 27\nNon-current marketable securities 23 27\nTotal marketable securities $ 261 $ 228\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, gross unrealized, gross realized, and net realized gains and/or losses (pre-tax) were not material.\nThe balances at December 31, 2022 for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.\n(Millions) 2022\nDue in one year or less $ 238\nDue after one year through five years 15\nDue after five years through ten years 8\nTotal marketable securities $ 261\nNOTE 12. Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Borrowings\nThe following debt tables reflect effective interest rates, which include the impact of interest rate swaps, as of December 31, 2022. If the debt was issued on a combined basis, the debt has been separated to show the impact of the fixed versus floating effective interest rates. Carrying value includes the impact of debt issuance costs and fair value hedging activity. Long-term debt and short-term borrowings as of December 31 consisted of the following:\nLong-Term Debt\n(Millions) Currency/ Fixed vs. Floating Effective Interest Rate Final Maturity Date Carrying Value\nDescription / 2022 Principal Amount 2022 2021\nMedium-term note (repaid in 2022)\nEUR Fixed - % 2022 - 567\nMedium-term note (repaid in 2022)\nUSD Fixed - % 2022 - 599\nRegistered note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 1.86 % 2023 500 499\nMedium-term note ($650 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.26 % 2023 650 649\nMedium-term note (\u20ac600 million)\nEUR Fixed 1.14 % 2023 639 679\nMedium-term note ($300 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.30 % 2024 300 299\nMedium-term note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.98 % 2024 501 501\nMedium-term note ($300 million)\nUSD Floating 4.81 % 2024 300 300\nRegistered note ($750 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.12 % 2025 747 746\nRegistered note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.67 % 2025 499 498\nMedium-term note ($550 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.04 % 2025 549 548\nMedium-term note ($650 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.37 % 2026 646 645\nMedium-term note (\u20ac750 million)\nEUR Fixed 1.65 % 2026 792 842\nFloating rate note ($19 million)\nUSD Floating 4.37 % 2027 18 19\nMedium-term note ($850 million)\nUSD Fixed 2.95 % 2027 845 844\n30-year debenture ($220 million)\nUSD Fixed 6.44 % 2028 223 224\nFloating rate note ($150 million)\nUSD Floating 6.49 % 2028 129 147\nFloating rate note ($150 million)\nUSD Floating 6.44 % 2028 129 147\nFloating rate note ($250 million)\nUSD Floating 6.69 % 2028 211 240\nFloating rate note ($150 million)\nUSD Floating 6.64 % 2028 127 144\nFloating rate note ($100 million)\nUSD Floating 6.73 % 2028 84 96\nMedium-term note ($600 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.62 % 2028 598 598\nMedium-term note ($800 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.38 % 2029 797 797\nRegistered note ($1 billion)\nUSD Fixed 2.50 % 2029 989 988\nRegistered note ($600 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.09 % 2030 596 596\nMedium-term note (\u20ac500 million)\nEUR Fixed 1.90 % 2030 526 560\nMedium-term note (\u20ac500 million)\nEUR Fixed 1.54 % 2031 530 563\n30-year bond ($555 million)\nUSD Fixed 5.73 % 2037 552 551\nFloating rate note ($52 million)\nUSD Floating 4.16 % 2040 52 52\nFloating rate note ($96 million)\nUSD Floating 4.16 % 2041 96 96\nMedium-term note ($325 million)\nUSD Fixed 4.05 % 2044 315 315\nFloating rate note ($54 million)\nUSD Floating 4.16 % 2044 53 53\nMedium-term note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.37 % 2046 478 477\nMedium-term note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.68 % 2047 492 492\nMedium-term note ($650 million)\nUSD Fixed 4.07 % 2048 638 638\nMedium-term note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.78 % 2048 504 505\nRegistered note ($500 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.37 % 2049 486 485\nRegistered note ($350 million)\nUSD Fixed 3.72 % 2050 346 346\nOther borrowings Various 0.09 % 2023-2029 2 2\nTotal long-term debt 15,939 17,347\nLess: current portion of long-term debt 1,938 1,291\nLong-term debt (excluding current portion) $ 14,001 $ 16,056\nPost-Swap Borrowing (Long-Term Debt, Including Current Portion)\n2022 2021\n(Millions) Carrying Value Effective Interest Rate Carrying Value Effective Interest Rate\nFixed-rate debt $ 14,738 2.93 % $ 16,053 2.80 %\nFloating-rate debt 1,201 5.70 % 1,294 1.43 %\nTotal long-term debt, including current portion $ 15,939 $ 17,347\nShort-Term Borrowings and Current Portion of Long-Term Debt\nEffective Interest Rate Carrying Value\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 1.93 % $ 1,938 $ 1,291\nOther borrowings - % - 16\nTotal short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt $ 1,938 $ 1,307\nOther short-term borrowings primarily consisted of bank borrowings by international subsidiaries.\nFuture Maturities of Long-term Debt\nMaturities of long-term debt in the table below reflect the impact of put provisions associated with certain debt instruments and are net of the unamortized debt issue costs such that total maturities equal the carrying value of long-term debt as of December 31, 2022.

The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lenders discretion), bringing the total facility up to $4.0 billion. In addition, 3M entered into a $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which was renewed in November 2022 with an expiration date of November 2023. The 364-day credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may convert any advances outstanding on the maturity date into term loans having a maturity date one year later. These credit facilities were undrawn at December 31, 2022. Under both the $3.0 billion and $1.25 billion credit agreements, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2022, this ratio was approximately 19 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.\nIn December 2021 and June 2022, 3M entered into debt financing facilities providing commitments for term loans and potential bridge financing aggregating $1.0 billion related to the Food Safety Division split-off transaction and combination with Neogen (discussed in Note 3). The debt commitments also included a $150 million revolving credit facility for the Food Safety business. Coincident with completion of the September 2022 split-off, the Food Safety business term loan borrowings funded the cash payment to 3M discussed in Note 3. The bridge financing component of these facilities was terminated early and not utilized. Obligations under the commitments (including the $150 million revolving credit facility) transferred with the Food Safety business and became those of Neogen.\nOther Credit Facilities\nThe Company also had an additional $318 million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022. These instruments are utilized in connection with normal business activities.\nLong-Term Debt Issuances and Fixed-to-Floating Interest Rate Swaps\nThe principal amounts, interest rates and maturity dates of individual long-term debt issuances can be found in the long-term debt table found at the beginning of this note.\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3Ms $1 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\nIn March 2020, 3M issued $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate registered notes. These were comprised of $500 million of 5-year notes due 2025 with a coupon rate of 2.65%, $600 million of 10-year notes due 2030 with a coupon rate of 3.05%, and $650 million of 30-year notes due 2050 with a coupon rate of 3.70%.\nLong-Term Debt Maturities and Extinguishments\nIn February 2022, 3M repaid 500 million euros aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured. In June 2022, 3M repaid $600 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium-term notes that matured.\nIn November 2021, 3M repaid 600 million euros aggregate principal amount of Eurobonds that matured.\nIn March 2021, 3M, via a make-whole-call offer, redeemed $450 million principal amount of 2.75% notes due 2022. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $11 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\nIn December 2020, 3M, via make-whole-call offers, repaid $1 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes. This included $400 million aggregate principal amount of 3.00% notes and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% notes, both of which were due to mature in 2021. The Company recorded an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge of approximately $10 million within interest expense. This charge reflected the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to reacquire the notes and related expenses.\nIn May 2020, 3M repaid $650 million euros aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured. In August 2020, 3M repaid $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating-rate medium-term notes that matured.\nFloating Rate Notes\nAt various times, 3M has issued floating rate notes containing put provisions. 3M would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the reduction schedules for each security. In December 2004, 3M issued a forty-year $60 million floating rate note, with a rate based on a floating LIBOR index (noting contracts will be modified to apply a new reference rate where applicable). Under the terms of this floating rate note due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. Under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040 and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten years from the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity at prices ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value. For the periods presented, 3M was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.\nNOTE 13. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\n3M has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. In total, 3M has over 75 defined benefit plans in 28 countries. Pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. The primary U.S. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2009. The Company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for its U.S. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the Company and were employed by the Company prior to January 1, 2016. Most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. The cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with U.S. amounts in the tables that follow.\nThe Company has made deposits for its defined benefit plans with independent trustees. Trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. There are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. For its U.S. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the Company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.\nThe Company also sponsors employee savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. These plans are offered to substantially all regular U.S. employees. For eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation matched in cash at rates of 45% or 60%, depending on the plan in which the employee participates. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2009, receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k) contributions of up to 5% of eligible compensation and receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participants total eligible compensation. All contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to the employees elections. Employer contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans were $241 million, $231 million and $201 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 3M subsidiaries in various international countries also participate in defined contribution plans. Employer contributions to the international defined contribution plans were $108 million, $117 million and $103 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, as a result of the divestiture of the drug delivery business, the Company recognized a curtailment in its United Kingdom Pension Plan. The resulting re-measurement of the pension plan funded status reduced long-term prepaid pension and post retirement assets (located within other assets of the Companys balance sheet) by approximately $80 million, which was offset within accumulated other comprehensive income (located within the equity section of the Companys balance sheet). The expense impact of this re-measurement was immaterial for the second quarter of 2020 and subsequent periods.\nThe following tables include a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as a summary of the related amounts recognized in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of December 31 of the respective years. 3M also has certain non-qualified unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, inclusive of plans related to supplement/excess benefits for employees impacted by particular relocations and other matters, that individually and in the aggregate are not significant and which are not included in the tables that follow. The obligations for these plans are included within other liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheet and aggregated to less than $51 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nQualified and Non-Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits\nUnited States International\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 18,104 $ 19,376 $ 7,942 $ 8,770 $ 2,281 $ 2,397\nAcquisitions/Transfers - - - - - -\nService cost 256 286 128 164 42 53\nInterest cost 417 360 125 98 52 43\nParticipant contributions - - 7 10 - -\nForeign exchange rate changes - - (567) (325) 1 (4)\nPlan amendments - - 8 1 - -\nActuarial (gain) loss (3,777) (588) (2,240) (433) (458) (89)\nBenefit payments (1,495) (1,330) (266) (298) (115) (113)\nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other - - (65) (45) (6) (6)\nBenefit obligation at end of year $ 13,505 $ 18,104 $ 5,072 $ 7,942 $ 1,797 $ 2,281\nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year 16,953 17,127 8,016 8,194 1,353 1,376\nAcquisitions/Transfers - - - - - -\nActual return on plan assets (2,875) 1,079 (1,286) 321 (218) 93\nCompany contributions 65 77 90 100 3 3\nParticipant contributions - - 7 10 - -\nForeign exchange rate changes - - (602) (265) - -\nBenefit payments (1,495) (1,330) (266) (298) (115) (113)\nSettlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other - - (68) (46) (6) (6)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year $ 12,648 $ 16,953 $ 5,891 $ 8,016 $ 1,017 $ 1,353\nFunded status at end of year $ (857) $ (1,151) $ 819 $ 74 $ (780) $ (928)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, (Millions) Qualified and Non-qualified Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits\nUnited States International\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nNon-current assets $ - $ - $ 1,225 $ 943 $ - $ -\nAccrued benefit cost\nCurrent liabilities (52) (59) (14) (14) (11) (5)\nNon-current liabilities (805) (1,092) (392) (855) (769) (923)\nEnding balance $ (857) $ (1,151) $ 819 $ 74 $ (780) $ (928)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, (Millions) Qualified and Non-qualified Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits\nUnited States International\n2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nNet transition obligation (asset) $ - $ - $ 4 $ 6 $ - $ -\nNet actuarial loss (gain) 4,616 4,991 157 960 332 538\nPrior service cost (credit) (56) (80) 10 3 (166) (197)\nEnding balance $ 4,560 $ 4,911 $ 171 $ 969 $ 166 $ 341\nThe balance of amounts recognized for international plans in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31 in the preceding table are presented based on the foreign currency exchange rate on that date.\nThe pension accumulated benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of the measurement date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels. The following table summarizes the total accumulated benefit obligations, the accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, and the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31:\nQualified and Non-qualified Pension Plans\nUnited States International\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 12,967 $ 17,305 $ 4,814 $ 7,484\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 402 $ 514 $ 775 $ 2,843\nFair value of plan assets - - 427 2,194\nPlans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets\nProjected benefit obligation $ 13,505 $ 18,104 $ 851 $ 3,204\nFair value of plan assets 12,648 16,953 442 2,335\nComponents of net periodic cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income\nThe service cost component of defined benefit net periodic benefit cost is recorded in cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research, development and related expenses.

The contributions provided by the Company to the health savings accounts increase 3 percent per year for employees who retired prior to January 1, 2016 and increase 1.5% for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company determined a discount rate of 5.18% for the U.S. pension plans and 5.25% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2022, which is an increase of 2.29 percentage points and an increase 2.37 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2021. An increase in the discount rate decreases the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2022 resulted in an approximately $4.5 billion lower benefit obligation for the U.S. pension and postretirement plans.\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-specific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 6.00% in 2022. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2022, the Companys 2023 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.50%. The expected return assumption is based on the strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The 2022 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 10% global equities, 14% private equities, 60% fixed-income securities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment management. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2022 was -17.4%. In 2021 the plan earned a rate of return of 6.7% and in 2020 earned a return of 13.6%. The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 5.2% and 7.1%, respectively. Return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.\nIn 2021 the Company updated the mortality improvement scales to the Society of Actuaries Scale MP- 2021. The December 31, 2021 update resulted in an immaterial increase to the U.S. pension PBO and U.S. accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. The Society of Actuaries did not release an update to the Scale MP-2021 in 2022.\nDuring 2022, the Company contributed $155 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. During 2021, the Company contributed $177 million to its U.S. and international pension plans and $3 million to its postretirement plans. In 2023, the Company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $200 million of cash to its U.S. and international retirement plans. The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2023. Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.\nFuture Pension and Postretirement Benefit Payments\nThe following table provides the estimated pension and postretirement benefit payments that are payable from the plans to participants.\nQualified and Non-qualified Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits\n(Millions) United States International\n2023 Benefit Payments $ 1,057 $ 262 $ 142\n2024 Benefit Payments 1,061 269 145\n2025 Benefit Payments 1,065 284 148\n2026 Benefit Payments 1,061 295 150\n2027 Benefit Payments 1,059 307 154\nNext five years 5,155 1,614 726\nPlan Asset Management\n3Ms investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. The primary goal of the trust funds is to meet the obligations as required. The secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the Company to an undue amount of contribution risk. Fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the potential need for additional contributions from 3M. The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities.\nNormally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. However, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3M securities. The aggregate amount of 3M securities are not considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.\nThe discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. See Note 15 for descriptions of these levels. While the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nU.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\nIn order to achieve the investment objectives in the U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation. The investment policies allow some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to vary from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans. Approximately 72% of the postretirement benefit plan assets are in a 401(h) account. The 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan and invested with the same investment objectives as the primary U.S. pension plan.\nThe fair values of the assets held by the U.S. pension plans by asset class are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as Fair Value at December 31,\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAsset Class (Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nEquities\nU.S. equities $ 501 $ 1,875 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 501 $ 1,875\nNon-U.S. equities 370 1,465 - - - - 370 1,465\nIndex and long/short equity funds* 271 404\nTotal Equities 871 3,340 - - - - 1,142 3,744\nFixed Income\nU.S. government securities 1,344 1,417 29 716 - - 1,373 2,133\nNon-U.S. government securities - - 70 89 - - 70 89\nPreferred and convertible securities - - 44 54 - - 44 54\nU.S. corporate bonds - 11 4,789 4,620 - - 4,789 4,631\nNon-U.S. corporate bonds - - 871 883 - - 871 883\nDerivative instruments 10 11 - 6 - - 10 17\nOther* 91 132\nTotal Fixed Income 1,354 1,439 5,803 6,368 - - 7,248 7,939\nPrivate Equity\nGrowth equity - 58 - - - - - 58\nPartnership investments* 1,700 2,003\nTotal Private Equity - 58 - - - - 1,700 2,061\nAbsolute Return\nFixed income and other 1 1 85 166 - - 86 167\nHedge fund/fund of funds* 1,297 1,943\nPartnership investments* 497 617\nTotal Absolute Return 1 1 85 166 - - 1,880 2,727\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents 8 11 22 9 - - 30 20\nRepurchase agreements and derivative margin activity - - (1) - - - (1) -\nCash and cash equivalents, valued at net asset value* 789 678\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents 8 11 21 9 - - 818 698\nTotal $ 2,234 $ 4,849 $ 5,909 $ 6,543 $ - $ - $ 12,788 $ 17,169\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets (140) (216)\nFair value of plan assets $ 12,648 $ 16,953\n* In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\nPublicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\nFixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts. Corporate debt includes bonds and notes, asset backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and private placements. Swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs. U.S. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. Corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Private placements are valued by the custodian using recognized pricing services and sources.\nThe private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of derivative instruments, growth equity and partnership interests. Growth equity investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\nAbsolute return consists primarily of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles. Corporate debt instruments are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risk ratings.\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include, interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\nThere were no level 3 assets in the fair values of the U.S. pension and postretirement plans assets for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nInternational Pension Plans Assets\nOutside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. The disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 70 defined benefit plans in over 25 countries; however, there is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country. Local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.\nEach plan has its own strategic asset allocation. The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.\nThe fair values of the assets held by the international pension plans by asset class are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as Fair Value at December 31,\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAsset Class (Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nEquities\nGrowth equities $ 59 $ 315 $ 99 $ 181 $ - $ - $ 158 $ 496\nValue equities 164 328 11 15 - - 175 343\nCore equities 65 107 142 547 2 5 209 659\nEquities, valued at net asset value* 1 2\nTotal Equities 288 750 252 743 2 5 543 1,500\nFixed Income\nDomestic government 73 73 1,060 1,039 3 4 1,136 1,116\nForeign government 29 22 327 458 - - 356 480\nCorporate debt securities 32 32 2,155 2,389 1 10 2,188 2,431\nFixed income securities, valued at net asset value* 623 893\nTotal Fixed Income 134 127 3,542 3,886 4 14 4,303 4,920\nPrivate Equity\nReal estate 2 2 50 58 2 5 54 65\nReal estate, valued at net asset value* 119 163\nPartnership investments* 265 226\nTotal Private Equity 2 2 50 58 2 5 438 454\nAbsolute Return\nDerivatives - - 1 20 - - 1 20\nInsurance - - - - 438 504 438 504\nOther 8 7 - - 1 6 9 13\nOther, valued at net asset value* - -\nHedge funds* 259 535\nTotal Absolute Return 8 7 1 20 439 510 707 1,072\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents 122 145 51 46 - - 173 191\nCash and cash equivalents, valued at net asset value* 2 1\nTotal Cash and Cash Equivalents 122 145 51 46 - - 175 192\nTotal $ 554 $ 1,031 $ 3,896 $ 4,753 $ 447 $ 534 $ 6,166 $ 8,138\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets (275) (122)\nFair value of plan assets $ 5,891 $ 8,016\n*In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets.\nEquities consist primarily of mandates in public equity securities managed to various public equity indices. Publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded.\nFixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate, (including mortgage backed and other debt) securities. Governments, corporate bonds and notes and mortgage backed securities are valued at the closing price reported if traded on an active market or at yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that utilizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\nPrivate equity funds consist of partnership interests in a variety of funds. Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts). REITS are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which it is traded.\nAbsolute return consists of private partnership interests in hedge funds, insurance contracts, derivative instruments, hedge fund of funds, and other alternative investments. Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end. Derivative instruments consist of various swaps and bond futures that are used to help manage risks.\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets include the net of interest receivables, amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased and interest payable.\nThe balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class. In 2022 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $24 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $42 million for a net decrease of $66 million. In 2021 the aggregate net purchases and net unrealized gains decreased this balance by $7 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased the balance by $44 million for a net decrease to this balance of $51 million.\nNOTE 14. Derivatives\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3Ms financial position and performance.\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\nImpact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 8.\nFair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 15.\nDerivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Companys long-term debt are also described in Note 12.\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\nCash Flow Hedges:\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\nCash Flow Hedging - Foreign Currency Forward and Option Contracts: The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. 3M may de-designate these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. The portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously included in accumulated other comprehensive income for de-designated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or becomes probable of not occurring. Changes in the value of derivative instruments after de-designation are recorded in earnings and are included in the Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments section below. The maximum length of time over which 3M hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows of the forecasted transactions is 36 months.\nCash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts: The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances.\nIn March 2020, the Company entered into treasury rate lock contracts with a notional amount of $500 million that were terminated concurrently with the March 2020 issuance of registered notes as discussed in Note 12. The termination resulted in an immaterial net loss within accumulated other comprehensive income that will be amortized for the respective lives of the debt.\nIn periods prior to 2020, the 3M entered into other forward starting interest rate swaps designated as hedges against interest rate volatility associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt. These included swaps terminated in 2019 concurrent with associated debt issuances. These 2019 terminations resulted in a net loss of $143 million within accumulated other comprehensive income that is being amortized over the respective lives of the debt.\nThe amortization of gains and losses on forward starting interest rate swaps is included in the tables below as part of the gain/(loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had a balance of $7 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. This includes a remaining balance of $94 million (after-tax loss) related to the forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock contracts, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the notes. Based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, of the total after-tax net unrealized balance as of December 31, 2022, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $68 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses from underlying hedged items).\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following table.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income on Derivative\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nForeign currency forward/option contracts $ 159 $ 108 $ (111)\nInterest rate contracts - - (2)\nTotal $ 159 $ 108 $ (113)\nFair Value Hedges:\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.\nFair Value Hedging - Interest Rate Swaps: The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To help manage borrowing costs, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense.\nIn November 2013, 3M issued a Eurobond which was due in 2021 for a face amount of 600 million euros. Upon debt issuance, 3M completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 300 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate Eurobond obligation. This interest rate swap matured in conjunction with the repayment of the Eurobond in November 2021.\nIn August 2015, 3M issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes. Upon debt issuance, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of a portion of the fixed interest rate medium-term note obligation. The first converted a $450 million three-year fixed rate note that matured in August 2018 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured, and the second converted $300 million of a five-year fixed rate note that matured in August 2020 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into an interest rate swap as a fair value hedge with a notional amount of $200 million that converted the companys fixed-rate medium-term note that matured in August 2020 at which time the associated interest rate swap also matured.\nIn September 2018, the Company entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200 million that converted a portion of the Companys $400 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 into a floating rate note with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index as a hedge of its exposure to changes in fair value that are attributable to interest rate risk. The Company terminated this interest rate swap in conjunction with the early debt repayment in December 2020 of $400 million aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate medium notes further described in Note 12.\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2021, 3M entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million. These swaps converted $500 million and $300 million of 3Ms $1.0 billion and $650 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050, respectively, into floating rate debt for the portion of their terms through mid-2028 with an interest rate based on a three-month LIBOR index.\n3M had a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap that was terminated in 2007 with respect to the Company's 30-year $220 million principal amount debenture due in 2028. As this debt is still outstanding, its carrying value includes the remaining basis adjustment from this discontinued fair value hedge.\nThe following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for active fair value hedges, as well as remaining amounts for discontinued fair value hedges:\n(Millions) Carrying Value of the Hedged Liabilities Cumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Included in the Carrying Value of the Hedged Liabilities\nLocation on the Consolidated Balance Sheet 2022 2021 2022 2021\nLong-term debt $ 903 $ 997 $ (98) $ (4)\nNet Investment Hedges:\nThe Company may use non-derivative (foreign currency denominated debt) and derivative (foreign exchange forward contracts) instruments to hedge portions of the Companys investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign exchange risk. For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. To the extent foreign currency denominated debt is not designated in or is de-designated from a net investment hedge relationship, changes in value of that portion of foreign currency denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are recorded in earnings through their maturity date.\n3Ms use of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in hedges of the Companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries can vary by time period depending on when foreign currency denominated debt balances designated in such relationships are de-designated, matured, or are newly issued and designated. Additionally, variation can occur in connection with the extent of the Companys desired foreign exchange risk coverage.\nAt December 31, 2022, the total notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts designated in net investment hedges was approximately 150 million euros, along with a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling 2.4 billion euros. The maturity dates of these derivative and nonderivative instruments designated in net investment hedges range from 2023 to 2031.\nThe amount of gain (loss) excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in income relative to instruments designated in net investment hedge relationships is not material. The amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income related to derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized as Cumulative Translation within Other Comprehensive Income\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nForeign currency denominated debt $ 162 $ 296 $ (351)\nForeign currency forward contracts 10 8 (1)\nTotal $ 172 $ 304 $ (352)\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments include de-designated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the Cash Flow Hedges section above). In addition, 3M enters into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. These derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nStatement of Income Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe location in the consolidated statement of income and pre-tax amounts recognized in income related to derivative instruments designated in cash flow or fair value hedging relationships and for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are as follows:\nLocation and Amount of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\nCost of sales Other expense (income), net\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nInformation regarding cash flow and fair value hedging relationships:\nTotal amounts of income and expense line items presented in the consolidated statement of income in which the effects of derivatives are recorded $ 19,232 $ 18,795 $ 16,605 $ 147 $ 165 $ 366\nGain or (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts:\nAmount of gain or (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income 107 (38) 80 - - -\nInterest rate contracts:\nAmount of gain or (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income - - - (9) (9) (9)\nGain or (loss) on fair value hedging relationships:\nInterest rate contracts:\nHedged items - - - 94 16 4\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments - - - (94) (16) (4)\nInformation regarding derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nGain or (loss) on derivatives not designated as instruments:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts (76) 5 2 45 (11) 43\nLocation, Fair Value, and Gross Notional Amounts of Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the fair value of 3Ms derivative instruments, excluding nonderivative instruments used as hedging instruments, and their location in the consolidated balance sheet.

However, the Companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Companys consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of the reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation.\nOffsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\nGross Amount of Derivative Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements\nGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative Liabilities Cash Collateral Received Net Amount of Derivative Assets\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements $ 217 $ 119 $ 40 $ 25 $ - $ - $ 177 $ 94\nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements - - - -\nTotal $ 217 $ 119 $ 177 $ 94\nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\nGross Amount of Derivative Liabilities Presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Gross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting Agreements\nGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative Assets Cash Collateral Received Net Amount of Derivative Liabilities\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nDerivatives subject to master netting agreements $ 142 $ 33 $ 40 $ 25 $ - $ - $ 102 $ 8\nDerivatives not subject to master netting agreements - - - -\nTotal $ 142 $ 33 $ 102 $ 8\nCurrency Effects\n3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, increased pre-tax income by approximately $127 million in 2022, decreased pre-tax income by approximately $105 million in 2021, and decreased pre-tax income by approximately $21 million in 2020. These estimates include transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\nNOTE 15. Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain derivative instruments. The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. Separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Companys financial statements on a recurring basis for 2022 and 2021.\n3M uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities - except certain U.S. municipal securities:\nMarketable securities, except certain U.S. municipal securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. A weighted average price is used for these securities. Market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. These multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding certain U.S. municipal securities) are classified as level 2. Marketable securities are discussed further in Note 11.\nAvailable-for-sale marketable securities -certain U.S. municipal securities only:\n3M holds municipal securities with several cities in the United States as of December 31, 2022. Due to the nature of these securities, the valuation method references the carrying value of the corresponding finance lease obligation, and as such, will be classified as level 3 securities separately.\nDerivative instruments:\nThe Companys derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value. The Companys derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. Net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3Ms net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under ASC 820, as the debt used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.\n3M has determined that foreign currency forwards, currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2 measurements. 3M uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3Ms primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.\nThe following tables provide information by level for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nFair Value at Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDescription (Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021\nAssets:\nAvailable-for-sale:\nMarketable securities:\nCommercial paper $ 213 $ 109 $ - $ - $ 213 $ 109 $ - $ -\nCertificates of deposit/time deposits 21 14 - - 21 14 - -\nU.S. treasury securities - 75 - 75 - - - -\nU.S. municipal securities 27 30 - - - - 27 30\nDerivative instruments - assets:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts 217 119 - - 217 119 - -\nLiabilities:\nDerivative instruments - liabilities:\nForeign currency forward/option contracts 40 24 - - 40 24 - -\nInterest rate contracts 102 9 - - 102 9 - -\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of items measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant unobservable inputs (level 3).\nMarketable securities - certain U.S. municipal securities only\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nBeginning balance $ 30 $ 34 $ 46\nTotal gains or losses:\nIncluded in earnings - - -\nIncluded in other comprehensive income - - -\nPurchases and issuances - - 10\nSales and settlements (3) (4) (22)\nTransfers in and/or out of level 3 - - -\nEnding balance $ 27 $ 30 $ 34\nChange in unrealized gains or losses for the period included in earnings for securities held at the end of the reporting period - - -\nIn addition, the plan assets of 3Ms pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). Refer to Note 13.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis:\nDisclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments, goodwill impairments, and adjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. There were no material impairments of assets or adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for 2022 and 2021. In September 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of net assets in Russia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $109 million, primarily within selling, general and administrative expense related to recording this held-for-sale disposal group at the lower of its fair value less cost to sell or carrying amount. In determining the carrying amount, the balance of cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss that will be eliminated upon sale was included and contributed to the impairment charge. As of December 31, 2022 the amounts of major assets and liabilities of this held-for-sale disposal group primarily included approximately $50 million within other current liabilities that largely represented a reserve against the balance of cumulative translation adjustment. Additionally, in December 2022, 3M committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025. As a result, 3M recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, related to impairment of long-lived and indefinite-lived assets ($0.5 billion - primarily associated with property, plant, and equipment) and impairment of goodwill ($0.3 billion). These charges were reflected within selling, general and administrative expense and goodwill impairment expense, respectively. The plan affects each of the Electronics Materials Solutions Division and Advanced Materials Division asset groupings/reporting units (both part of the Transportation and Electronics business) with impairment resulting for the Advanced Materials Division. Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, discount rates and other applicable items. Significant unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair values of the asset groupings included discount rates, which were 11% to 12%.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified as level 2) for its long-term debt, the Company utilized third-party quotes, which are derived all or in part from model prices, external sources, market prices, or the third-partys internal records. Information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:\n2022 2021\n(Millions) Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nLong-term debt, excluding current portion $ 14,001 $ 12,484 $ 16,056 $ 17,601\nThe fair values reflected in the sections above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. The carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of certain fixed rate Eurobond securities issued by the Company as hedging instruments of the Companys net investment in its European subsidiaries.\nNOTE 16. Commitments and Contingencies\nWarranties/Guarantees:\n3Ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $48 million at December 31, 2022, and $48 million at December 31, 2021. Further information on product warranties is not disclosed, as the Company considers the balance immaterial to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 3M guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings include, but are not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal healthcare program related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act and anti-kickback laws, securities, and environmental laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to time, the Company also receives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries. The Company generally responds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the Company. Such requests can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of administrative, civil, or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and others, as well as to settlements. The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict. Any determination that the Companys operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment or injunctive relief.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Liabilities Related to Legal Proceedings\nMany lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and alleged actual damages, all of which are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. Assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. When making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the Company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. Many of the matters described are at preliminary stages or seek an indeterminate amount of damages. It is not uncommon for claims to be resolved over many years. A future adverse ruling, settlement, unfavorable development, or increase in accruals for one or more of these matters could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the Company could change in the future.\nProcess for Disclosure and Recording of Insurance Receivables Related to Legal Proceedings\nThe Company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of the terms of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage, and records an amount it has concluded is recognizable and expects to receive in light of the loss recovery and/or gain contingency models under ASC 450, ASC 610-30, and related guidance. For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the Company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Companys insurance program. For those insured matters where the Company has not recorded an accrued liability because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the Company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable for the expense incurred.\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 4,028 individual claimants, compared to approximately 3,876 individual claimants with actions pending December 31, 2021.\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Companys mask and respirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Companys current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen of the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits - one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December - both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3Ms 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In 2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April 2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above and the appeal has been dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington, involving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3Ms 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury delivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of plaintiffs mesothelioma. The plaintiff appealed the verdict. In May 2022, the First Division intermediate appellate court in Washington affirmed in part and reversed in part 3Ms trial victory, concluding that the trial court misapplied Washington law in instructing the jury about factual causation. The Washington Supreme Court declined to review the matter.\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Companys respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Companys litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. Since the second half of 2020, the Company has experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine dust; that increase represents the substantial majority of the growth in case numbers referred to above.\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for workers compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. In October 2019, the court granted the States motion to sever its unfair trade practices claim, which seeks civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation under the state's Consumer Credit Protection Act relating to statements that the State contends were misleading about 3Ms respirators. A bench trial for the unfair trade practices claims has been rescheduled for late February 2023. An expert witness retained by the State has recently estimated that 3M sold over five million respirators into the state during the relevant time period, and the State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Act. 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a separate violation of the Act. 3M has asserted various additional defenses, including that the Company's marketing did not violate the Act at any time, and that the State's claims are barred under the applicable statute of limitations. No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia as to key issues, and the assertions of claims against two other manufacturers where a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a factfinder may allocate to each defendant if the case were ultimately tried.\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities. The Company reviews recent and historical claims data, including without limitation, (i) the number of pending claims filed against the Company, (ii) the nature and mix of those claims (i.e., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the Companys mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the Company), (iii) the costs to defend and resolve pending claims, and (iv) trends in filing rates and in costs to defend and resolve claims, (collectively, the Claims Data). As part of its comprehensive legal review, the Company regularly provides the Claims Data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of Claims Data on future filing trends and costs. The third party assists the Company in estimating the costs to defend and resolve pending and future claims. The Company uses these estimates to develop its best estimate of probable liability.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the Companys estimate of its liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the key assumptions underlying the Companys accrual, including, the number of future claims, the nature and mix of those claims, the average cost of defending and resolving claims, and in maintaining trial readiness (ii) trial and appellate outcomes, (iii) the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (iv) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.\nAs a result of its review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, of pending and expected lawsuits and of the cost of resolving claims of persons who claim more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, the Company increased its accruals in 2022 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $31 million. In 2022, the Company made payments for legal defense costs and settlements of $67 million related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $604 million. This accrual represents the Companys best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against the Company approaching the year 2050. The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established because of the (i) inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claims may be asserted, (ii) the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii) the multiple factors described above that the Company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv) the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the Companys estimate of liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Companys receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $4 million. In addition, the Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers. Once those claims for coverage are resolved, the Company will have collected substantially all of its remaining insurance coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims.\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies\nOn April 1, 2008, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the stock of Aearo Holding Corp., the parent of Aearo Technologies (Aearo). Aearo manufactured and sold various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products. Aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated Aearos respirator business (American Optical Corporation, Warner-Lambert LLC, AO Corp. and Cabot Corporation (Cabot)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from Aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, coal mine dust, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. In July 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation (including the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters). This represents a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. As a result, 3M's accrual relative to the commitments associated with that trust includes Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has stayed the Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters as the chapter 11 proceedings move forward. For additional information, see the discussion within the section \"Product Liability Litigation\" with respect to Aearo Technologies Dual-Ended Combat Arms Earplugs.\nPreceding respirator mask/asbestos - Aearo Technologies matters/information:\nPrior to the voluntary chapter 11 proceedings and as previously disclosed, as of December 31, 2021, the Company, through its Aearo subsidiary, had accruals of $46 million for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future Aearo-related asbestos, silica-related and coal mine dust claims. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers (the Payor Group). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the AO Safety brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. Aearos share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11, 1995. This agreement provides that, so long as Aearo pays to Cabot a quarterly fee of $100,000, Cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify Aearo against, any product liability claims involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products for respirators sold prior to July 11, 1995. Because of the difficulty in determining how long a particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold, Aearo and Cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica or silica products prior to January 1, 1997. With these arrangements in place, Aearos potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators involving exposure to asbestos, silica, or silica products on or after January 1, 1997. To date, Aearo has elected to pay the quarterly fee. Aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-July 11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with Cabot if Aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if Cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.\nDevelopments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearos liabilities. These developments include, but are not limited to: (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv) significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii) the financial viability of members of the Payor Group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limits, and/or (ix) a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which Aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of Aearos share of liability for these existing and future claims. If any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued. Because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the Payor Group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearos liabilities, the Company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which Aearos liability may exceed the accrual the Company has established.\nEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\nThe Companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic or hazardous substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, many for which private parties in the United States and abroad have rights of action. These laws and regulations can form the basis of, under certain circumstances, claims for the investigation and remediation of contamination, for capital investment in pollution control equipment, for restoration of and/or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. In its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.\nUnder certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and similar state laws, the Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of. The Company has identified numerous locations, many of which are in the United States, at which it may have some liability for remediation of contamination. Please refer to the section entitled Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAs previously reported, the Company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively PFAS).\nAs a result of a phase-out decision in May 2000, the Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their pre-cursor compounds. The Company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by the end of 2008. The Company continues to manufacture a variety of shorter chain length PFAS compounds, including, but not limited to, pre-cursor compounds to perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS). These compounds are used as input materials to a variety of products, including engineered fluorinated fluids, fluoropolymers and fluorelastomers, as well as surfactants, additives, and coatings. Through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the Companys policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as intended substances in products, or as byproducts in some of 3Ms current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025. 3Ms decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as accelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or eliminating the presence of PFAS in the environment and changing stakeholder expectations.\nPFAS Regulatory and Legislative Activity\nRegulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. These activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of PFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease. Global regulations also appear to be increasingly focused on a broader group of PFAS, and may include those PFAS compounds used in current products. If such activity continues and regulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement actions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3Ms reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely on regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory drinking water and other standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\nEurope\nIn the European Union, where 3M has PFAS manufacturing facilities in countries such as Germany and Belgium, recent regulatory activities have included both preliminary and on-going work on various restrictions of PFAS or certain PFAS compounds under the EUs Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the EUs Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Regulation. PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS (and their related compounds) have also been listed in the Stockholm Convention, which has been ratified by more than 180 countries and aims for global elimination of certain listed substances (with narrow exceptions).\nIn January 2023, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) received a proposal for a broad restriction of PFAS as a class under REACH. ECHA has stated it expects to publish the proposal for public consultation in February 2023.\nEffective January 2023, the EU Food Contaminants Regulation targeting four PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS) in foodstuff (eggs and animal derived meat) prohibits the sale in all member states of foods containing levels of these chemicals exceeding the regulatory thresholds. As member states implement the regulation, Dyneon, a 3M subsidiary that operates the Gendorf facility in Germany, in coordination with local authorities and farmers, has proposed a pilot program of food sampling to determine if any remedial action is necessary.\nThe EU regulates PFAS in drinking water via a Drinking Water Directive, which includes a limit of 0.1 micrograms per liter (\u00b5g/l) (or 0.1 parts for billion (ppb)) for a sum of 20 PFAS in drinking water. Member States have until January 2023 to implement the Directive in their countries.\nDyneon has a recycling process for a critical emulsifier from which small amounts of PFOA are present after recycling, as an unintended and unavoidable byproduct of certain earlier process steps. With respect to the applicability of the amendment of the EU POPs Regulation with PFOA applicable since 2021, Dyneon proactively consulted with the relevant German competent authority regarding process improvements underway. The implementation of process improvements and analytical work is ongoing.\n3M Belgium, a subsidiary of the Company, has been working with the Public Flemish Waste Agency (OVAM) for several years to investigate and remediate historical PFAS contaminations at and near the 3M Belgium facility in Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, Belgium. In connection with a ring road construction project (the Oosterweel Project) in Antwerp that involved extensive soil work, an investigative committee with judicial investigatory powers was formed in June 2021 by the Flemish Parliament to investigate PFAS found in the soil and groundwater near the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium testified at Flemish parliamentary committee hearings in June and September 2021 on PFAS-related matters. The Flemish Parliament, the Minister of the Environment, and regulatory authorities initiated investigations and demands for information related to the release of PFAS from the Zwijndrecht facility. The Company has cooperated with the authorities in the investigations and information requests and is working with the authorities on an ongoing basis, as they continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgiums operations at the Zwijndrecht facility, as further discussed below. Separately, as previously disclosed, the Company is aware that certain residents of Zwijndrecht and non-governmental organizations filed a criminal complaint with an Antwerp investigatory judge against 3M Belgium, alleging it had unlawfully abandoned waste in violation of its environmental care obligations. Certain additional parties reportedly joined the complaint. 3M Belgium has not been served with any such complaint.\nSafety measures - wastewater discharge. In August 2021, the Flemish Government served 3M Belgium with a safety measure requiring the capture of certain process wastewaters to prevent their entry into the site wastewater treatment plant. While 3M Belgium appealed the Safety Measure due to the belief it lacked adequate legal and factual foundation, 3M Belgium promptly implemented the required actions.\nIn October 2021, the Province of Antwerp unilaterally adopted lower discharge limits for the nine PFAS compounds specifically identified in the water discharge permit and added a special condition that essentially prohibits discharge of any PFAS chemistry without a specific limit in the permit. 3M Belgium received a new two-year permit in May 2022 which contains strict new limits for 24 different PFAS, effective July 1, 2022. 3M Belgium believes that the recently installed additional control systems will enable it to meet these limits. Subsequently, the environmental enforcement agency has recently informed 3M Belgium that the agency believes that 3M Belgium must apply for discharge limits for certain additional short-chain PFAS pursuant to the special condition. Although disagreeing with the agencys position, 3M Belgium is in the process of developing the application to amend the permit to add the additional PFAS. 3M Belgium has insufficient information to predict the limits that will be set forth for additional short-chain PFAS and is therefore unable to assess whether the current or future wastewater treatment system, as currently conceived, will meet future limits imposed. In December 2022, 3M Belgium received an official infraction report from the Flemish Environmental Inspectorate regarding the discharge of certain short chain PFAS compounds in wastewater from the Zwijndrecht facility. 3M Belgium previously identified these compounds and shared the results with the Inspectorate. The compounds at issue do not have specific discharge limits in the applicable wastewater discharge permit, and the infraction report references a special condition in the permit that prohibits detectable discharge of PFAS compounds that do not have a specific discharge limit in the permit. 3M Belgium disagrees with the Inspectorates interpretation of the special condition and the time period permitted for compliance with it. Moreover, 3M Belgium instituted a capturing process to prevent wastewaters containing short chain PFAS identified in the infraction report from entering the treatment system or its discharge. 3M Belgium notified the Inspectorate that complying with the special condition means ceasing the legally required extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. The Inspectorate acknowledged this fact but insisted that 3M Belgium continue to extract and treat groundwater. Groundwater treatment continues and 3M Belgium expects to apply for a modification of the water discharge permit to add parameters for the short chain PFAS. 3M Belgium will continue its efforts to comply with the special condition and to minimize discharge of all PFAS, including the PFAS identified in the infraction report, but an inability to meet discharge limits for short chain PFAS could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgiums normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the facility, some of which may not be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could in turn impact these businesses ability to fulfill supply obligations to their customers.\nSafety measure - emissions. As previously disclosed, in October 2021, the Flemish environmental enforcement agency issued a new safety measure that prohibits all emissions of all forms of PFAS from the facility unless and until specifically approved on a process-by-process basis. 3M Belgium thereupon commenced an appeal process to the Council of States, seeking, among other things, urgent suspension of the safety measure during the pendency of the appeal process. At the same time, 3M Belgium complied with the safety measure by idling the affected production at the facility. The Council of States declined to grant urgent suspension of the safety measure. 3M Belgium established a regular cadence of meetings with the relevant authorities to review restart of specific PFAS-related production processes. The agency recently clarified that the safety measure applies to release of PFAS into water, and as such, reviews have been expanded as requested.\nIn October 2022, 3M Belgium received a report from the Flemish inspectorate regarding certain health and safety issues noted during inspections of the Zwjindrecht facility in March 2022, alleging certain related deficiencies, some dating back to 2010. In December 2022, 3M Belgium provided the inspectorate with responses to the allegations, including plans and timelines for compliance where applicable, and plans to continue to inform the inspectorate on corrective actions to be taken.\nAs of July 2022, the authorities have approved the restart of key production processes and 3M Belgium continues to conduct required monitoring and reporting activities. Belgian government authorities continue to maintain oversight of 3M Belgiums operations and compliance with applicable requirements at the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2022, the environmental enforcement agency issued an infraction report alleging that 3M Belgium had misconstrued an exemption in the safety measure and thus not fully complied with the safety measure in the operation of certain production lines. Discussions are underway with the environmental enforcement agency and those production lines are now being addressed in accordance with the review and approval provisions of the safety measure. Although the authorities have approved the restart and/or continued operation of key production processes, a negative development in their ongoing oversight review, or inability to fully restart all production processes, could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgiums normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and other materials from the facility, some of which may not be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could in turn impact these businesses ability to fulfill supply obligations to their customers. A previously reported administrative measure by the Flemish Government regarding soil piles has been complied with and 3M Belgium removed the soil piles prior to the deadline.\nNotice of default - environmental law compliance. Also in September 2021, the Flemish Region issued a notice of default alleging violations of environmental laws and seeking PFAS-related information, indemnity and a remediation plan for soil and water impacts due to PFAS originating from the Zwijndrecht facility. In September 2021, 3M responded to the notice of default and announced a plan to invest up to 125 million euros in the next three years in actions related to the Zwijndrecht community, including support for local commercial farmers impacted by restrictions on sale of agricultural products, and enhancements to site discharge control technologies. 3M is also committed to payment for ongoing off-site descriptive soil investigation and appropriate soil remediation. In March 2022, the Company announced an investment of 150 million euros to advance remedial actions to address legacy PFAS previously produced at the Zwijndrecht facility. An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has progressed towards a remedial action plan based on a descriptive soil investigation that would help inform 3M Belgiums remedial actions onsite and in certain surrounding areas. 3M Belgium representatives continue to have discussions with the relevant authorities regarding further soil remedial actions in connection with the Flemish Soil Decree, which requires both public authorities and private parties to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater in Flanders. 3M Belgium cannot exclude the possibility of future government executive decisions expanding its remedial obligations under the Soil Decree, including through a proposed executive decision that may be finalized in 2023 following an anticipated advisory opinion from the Belgian administrative court. 3M Belgium submitted a letter to that court identifying several procedural and legal issues with the proposed executive decision. A response is planned to a notice received in January 2023 from the Flemish government regarding the remediation action plans under the Flemish Soil Decree.\nIn July 2022, 3M Belgium and the Flemish Government announced an agreement in connection with the Zwijndrecht facility. Pursuant to the agreement, 3M Belgium, among other things, committed an aggregate of 571 million euros, which includes the previous commitments described above. In aggregate, the commitment includes enhancements to site discharge control technologies, support for qualifying local farmers, amounts to address certain identified priority remedial actions (which may include supporting additional actions as required under the Flemish Soil Decree), funds to be used by the Flemish Government in its sole discretion in connection with PFAS emissions from the Zwijndrecht facility, and support for the Oosterweel Project in cash and support services. The agreement contains certain provisions ending current litigation and providing certain releases of liability for 3M, while recognizing that the Flemish Government retains its authority to act in the future to protect its citizenry. In connection with these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $500 million in the first half of 2022, with approximately $355 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nCivil litigation - As of December 31, 2022, a total of nine actions against 3M Belgium are pending in Belgian civil courts. The cases include claims by neighboring and other companies for alleged soil and wastewater or rainwater contamination with PFAS; and tort liability claims and environmental injunction procedure by environmental NGOs and several hundred individuals. One of the actions has been rescheduled for judicial hearings in April 2023 and another is scheduled in February 2023; the other actions are in early stages.\nThe Netherlands government has indicated they are investigating potential claims to recover damages from companies related to alleged PFAS contamination in the Western Scheldt, a river that flows through Belgium and the Netherlands.\nUnited States: Federal Activity\nIn the United States, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data studies of both PFOA and PFOS. In October 2021, EPA released its PFAS Strategic Roadmap: EPA's Commitments to Action 2021-2024, which presents EPAs approach to PFAS, including investing in research to increase the understanding of PFAS, pursuing a comprehensive approach to proactively control PFAS exposures to humans and the environment, and broadening and accelerating the scope of clean-up of PFAS in the environment.\nIn June 2022, EPA released new final lifetime health advisory levels for PFBS (2,000 ppt) and HFPO-DA and its salts (GenX) (4 ppt), and new interim lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA (.004 ppt) and PFOS (.02 ppt). Lifetime health advisories are intended to provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. The health advisories are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, but if EPA uses the same methodology in setting national primary drinking water standards, discussed further below, or other national or state regulations, 3M could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including in future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement actions.\nIn May 2021, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) within the Department of Health and Human Services finalized a Toxicological Profile for certain PFAS that established minimal risk levels (MRLs) for PFOS, PFOA and several other PFAS. An MRL is an estimate of the daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be without appreciable risk of adverse non-cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs establish a screening level and are not intended to define cleanup or action levels for ATSDR or other agencies. Earlier, in April 2021, EPA released a final toxicity assessment for PFBS.\nIn May 2022, EPA added five PFAS substances - HFPO-DA, PFOS, PFOA perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) -- to its list of Regional Screening and Removal Management Levels based on the May 2021 MRLs. EPA had previously added PFBS to both lists in 2014. Regional Screening Levels are used to identify contaminated media that may require further investigation, while Regional Removal Management Levels are used by EPA to support certain actions under CERCLA.\nEPA began the process of establishing a national primary drinking water regulation for PFOA and PFOS in November 2021 by referring its proposed approach to developing a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) to the Science Advisory Board (SAB) and soliciting public comment. The Company submitted initial comments in December 2021 and supplemental comments in January and February 2022. In August 2022, the Science Advisory Board published its final report analyzing EPAs proposed approach to developing a MCLG. EPA submitted the draft MCL and MCLG for PFOA and PFOS to OMB for review in October 2022. EPA is expected to publish a proposed MCLG and national primary drinking water standard in early 2023. In November 2022, EPA published its final Drinking Water Contaminant Candidates List 5 (CCL 5), which includes a broad group of PFAS that are not currently subject to national primary drinking water regulations but which EPA is considering for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). In December 2022, EPA issued guidance to states for incorporating PFAS requirements into the Clean Water Act National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, including recommendations to require PFAS monitoring and incorporating limits for PFAS in industrial discharges.\nIn October 2021, EPA announced it will initiate a rulemaking to designate four PFAS compounds as hazardous constituents under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Further, in September 2022, EPA published in the Federal Register its proposal to list PFOA and PFOS, including their salts and structural isomers, as CERCLA hazardous substances. 3M submitted comments on EPAs proposal in November 2022. If CERCLA or RCRA designations are finalized and become enforceable, 3M may be required to undertake additional investigative or remediation activities where 3M conducts operations or where 3M has disposed of waste. 3M may also face additional litigation from other entities that have liability under these laws for contribution to clean-up costs other entities might have.\nEPA has also taken several actions to increase reporting and restrictions regarding PFAS under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which is a part of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. EPA has added more than 170 PFAS compounds to the list of substances that must be included in TRI reports as of July 2021. In December 2022, EPA published a proposed rule to adding PFAS subject to reporting under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-know Act (EPCRA) to the list of Lower Thresholds for Chemicals of Special Concern (Chemicals of Special Concern), which would require Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting of de minimis uses of those PFAS.\nIn January 2023, EPA issued a test order under TSCA to manufacturers, including the Company, requiring them to conduct certain health and safety testing related to HFPO, a PFAS, and submit the results to EPA. 3M has submitted its initial response.\nIn April 2022, EPA released draft Aquatic Life Criteria for PFOA and PFOS. These criteria, once finalized, may be used by states in developing water quality standards for protection of aquatic life under the Clean Water Act. 3M submitted comments on the draft criteria in July 2022.\nUnited States: State Activity\nSeveral state legislatures and state agencies have been evaluating or have taken actions related to cleanup standards, groundwater values or drinking water values for PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS, and 3M has submitted various responsive comments. In Minnesota, the Minnesota Department of Health in May 2017 stated that Health Based Values (HBVs) are designed to reduce long-term health risks across the population and are based on multiple safety factors to protect the most vulnerable citizens, which makes them overprotective for most of the residents in our state. As of 2021, the current HBVs are 35 ppt for PFOA, 15 ppt for PFOS, 47 ppt for PFHxS and 2 ppb for PFBS.\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) published the final version of its PFAS Monitoring Plan in March 2022. Four 3M facilities - Cottage Grove, Maplewood, Hutchinson, and Woodbury - are among the 137 Minnesota facilities that are preliminarily scoped to be within the Monitoring Plan.\nStates with finalized drinking water standards for certain PFAS include California, Vermont, New Jersey, New York, New Hampshire, Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nSome other states have also been evaluating or have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS compounds in products such as food packaging, carpets and other products. For example, in June 2022, Colorado enacted a law which restricts the sale of certain consumer products, including carpets and furniture, fabric treatments, food packaging, and childrens products that contain intentionally added PFAS.\nIn October 2022, California passed legislation prohibiting the manufacture, distribution of sale of textiles and cosmetics containing certain PFAS. Additionally, in 2021 and 2022, California finalized its listing of PFOS (and its salts and transformation and degradation precursors) and PFOA as carcinogens, and PFNA as a reproductive toxicant under its Proposition 65 law. California has also proposed listing PFDA, PFHxS, and PFUNDA as reproductive toxicants under Proposition 65.\nIn the Summer of 2021, the State of Maine passed its Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Pollution, which bans intentionally added PFAS in products effective January 1, 2030 and requires broad reporting of products containing intentionally-added PFAS effective January 1, 2023. In December 2022, 3M submitted to the Maine Department of Environmental Protection a list of products containing intentionally added PFAS that have been sold in the U.S. in the past two years in compliance with the law.\nIn October 2020, 3M and several other parties filed notices of appeal in the appellate division of the Superior Court of New Jersey to challenge the validity of the New Jersey PFOS and PFOA regulations. In January 2021, the appellate division of the court denied the groups motion to stay the regulations. The court heard oral argument in November 2022.\nIn March 2021, 3M filed a lawsuit against the New York State Department of Health, on the grounds that drinking water levels set by the agency for PFOS and PFOA should be vacated because they are arbitrary and did not comply with statutorily required processes. An oral argument on the merits was held in December 2021. In June 2022, the court issued a decision denying and dismissing the Companys lawsuit on standing grounds. The Company has filed a notice of appeal in July 2022 and decided in January 2023 not to pursue the appeal\nIn April 2021, 3M also filed a lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) to invalidate the drinking water standards EGLE promulgated under an accelerated timeline. In November 2022, the court granted 3Ms motion for summary judgment on the merits and invalidated EGLEs rule based on its failure to properly consider relevant costs. The court stayed the effect of its decision pending appeal. EGLE appealed the decision in December 2022.\nBetween 2018 and 2022, seven states have enacted laws requiring written notification of firefighting personal protective equipment (PPE) that contains PFAS, with most such laws providing for potential civil penalties for non-compliance. In November 2022, the Company identified it likely did not provide required notifications for some of its products, including its Scott Safety Self-Contained Breathing Apparatuses. The Company began providing written notices with those products starting November 2022. In addition, the Company continues to work to determine the extent of any potential non-compliance, has made voluntary self-disclosures to states as applicable, and has expressed its willingness to work with those states to address and resolve any potential non-compliance. The Company cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by those states.\nThe Company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions to the Company, including to its manufacturing operations and its products. Given divergent and rapidly evolving regulatory standards, there is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required.\nLitigation Related to Historical PFAS Manufacturing Operations in Alabama\nAs previously reported, 3M has resolved numerous claims relating to alleged PFAS contamination of properties and water supplies by 3Ms Decatur, Alabama manufacturing facility. In April 2019, 3M settled a lawsuit brought by the West Morgan-East Lawrence Water & Sewer Authority for $35 million, which will fund a new water filtration system, with 3M indemnifying the Water Authority from liability resulting from the resolution of certain lawsuits against the Water Authority alleging liability or damages related to 3M PFAS. In October 2021, 3M settled a class action brought by plaintiffs who were supplied drinking water by the Water Authority (the Lindsey case) for an immaterial amount. The court issued a final order approving the class settlement and dismissing the action in March 2022. In October 2021, 3M also reached agreements in principle to resolve litigation with the Tennessee Riverkeeper organization, the St. John plaintiff class, plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters. A court granted final approval of the St. John class settlement in April 2022, and plaintiffs in the Stover, Owens, and Chandler matters filed dismissals thereafter. In June 2022, the court dismissed the Tennessee Riverkeeper case with prejudice. In November 2021, 3M and the City of Decatur, Decatur Utilities and Morgan County executed a collaborative agreement under which the Company agreed to contribute approximately $99 million and also to continue to address certain PFAS-related matters in the area. The contribution relates to initiatives to improve the quality of life and overall environment in Decatur, including community redevelopment and recreation projects by the City, County and Decatur Utilities. It also includes addressing certain PFAS matters at the Morgan County landfill and reimbursement of costs previously incurred related to PFAS remediation. 3M will continue to address PFAS at certain other closed municipal sites at which the Company historically disposed waste and continue environmental characterization in the area. This work will complement the Interim Consent Order that 3M entered with ADEM in 2020 and includes sampling of environmental media, such as ground water, regarding the potential presence of PFAS at the 3M Decatur facility and legacy disposal sites, as well as supporting the execution of appropriate remedial actions. In March 2022, 3M reached a settlement agreement with plaintiffs in the Billings matter, resulting in dismissal of the case in August 2022. In August 2022, 3M reached an agreement to settle personal injury claims brought by 37 individual plaintiffs in the King matter. 3M continues to negotiate with individual property owners regarding claims relating to former 3M disposal sites and has resolved several such claims for an immaterial amount.\nIn September 2020, the City of Guin Water Works and Sewer Board (Guin WWSB) brought a lawsuit against 3M in Alabama state court alleging that PFAS contamination in the Guin water system stems from manufacturing operations at 3Ms Guin facility and disposal activity at a nearby landfill. Guin WWSB dismissed its lawsuit without prejudice in order to work with 3M to further investigate the presence of chemicals in the area; and in December 2021, the parties reached a settlement under which 3M agreed to contribute $30 million that will be used on a new treatment system for Guins drinking water and a new wastewater treatment facility. In March 2022, a new putative class action was filed in the Northern District of Alabama on behalf of Guin WWSB ratepayers. Defendants include 3M, the Guin landfill, the Guin WWSB, and some waste transporters. The case has been removed to federal court and was transferred to the AFFF MDL in December 2022.\nIn August 2022, Colbert County, Alabama, which opted out of the St. John settlement, filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River, from which the County withdraws its drinking water. The Companys motion to dismiss was denied in December 2022.\nState Attorneys General Litigation related to PFAS\nAs previously reported, several state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against 3M and other defendants that are now pending in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) court in South Carolina regarding Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF), described further below. The lawsuits generally seek, on a state-wide basis: injunctive relief, investigative and remedial work, compensatory damages, natural resource damages, attorneys fees, and, where available, punitive damages related to the states response to PFAS contamination. Currently in the AFFF MDL, state attorneys general lawsuits have been brought against 3M on behalf of the people of the states of Alaska; New York; Ohio; New Jersey; New Hampshire; Vermont, Michigan; Mississippi; North Carolina; Massachusetts; Wisconsin; and on behalf of the people of the territory of Guam and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.\nThere are also multiple state attorneys general lawsuits that are pending outside the AFFF MDL, as described below.\nNew Jersey. In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed two actions against 3M, DuPont, and Chemours on behalf of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP), the NJDEPs commissioner, and the New Jersey Spill Compensation Fund regarding alleged discharges at two DuPont facilities in Pennsville, New Jersey (Salem County) and Parlin, New Jersey (Middlesex County). 3M is included as a defendant in both cases because it allegedly supplied PFOA to DuPont for use at the facilities at issue. Both cases expressly seek to have the defendants pay all costs necessary to investigate, remediate, assess, and restore the affected natural resources of New Jersey. DuPont removed these cases to federal court. In June 2020, the court consolidated the two actions, along with two others brought by the NJDEP relating to the DuPont facilities, for case management and pretrial purposes. The parties are conducting discovery.\nNew Hampshire. In May 2019, the New Hampshire Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the states drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The Company recently removed the other case to federal court and attempted to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this juncture in the litigation. The state has moved to remand the case back to state court, which remains pending.\nVermont. In June 2019, the Vermont Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the states drinking water supplies and other natural resources by PFAS chemicals. As described above, one lawsuit was transferred to the AFFF MDL. The other suit asserts PFAS contamination from non-AFFF sources and names 3M and several entities related to DuPont and Chemours as defendants. This suit is proceeding in state court, where the parties are engaging in discovery and the court has set a trial-ready date in October 2024.\nIn October 2022, the Vermont Attorney General amended the complaint in the non-AFFF lawsuit, to add claims related to PFBS and GenX and to add a claim under Vermonts Waste Management Act, which was recently amended to add manufacturers as liable parties for the release or threatened release of hazardous materials (which in Vermont includes certain PFAS compounds).\nIllinois. In March 2022, the Illinois Attorney General filed a lawsuit in Illinois state court against 3M alleging contamination of the state's natural resources by PFAS compounds disposed of by, or discharged, or emitted from 3M's Cordova plant. The complaint requests monetary damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, a testing program, and a public outreach and information sharing program. The case was removed to federal court and 3M moved to transfer it to the AFFF MDL, which was denied at this stage in the litigation. The state has moved to remand the case back to state court. In January 2023, the Illinois Attorney General filed a new lawsuit against 3M and other defendants in Illinois state court, alleging contamination of a number of drinking water systems and natural resource damages at several sites statewide, and seeking to recover monetary damages, injunctive relief for remediation, civil penalties and other relief. The complaint states that the Attorney General is not seeking damages for AFFF by this lawsuit.\nCalifornia. In November 2022, the California Attorney General filed a lawsuit in state court against 18 defendants, including the Company, alleging environmental contamination by PFAS chemicals and seeking injunctive relief, civil penalties, and damages for the costs of investigations, cleanup and remediation. The case has been removed to federal court, and the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) has issued a conditional transfer order which, if finalized, would send the case to the AFFF MDL.\nIn addition to the above state attorneys general actions, several other states and the District of Columbia, through their attorneys general, have announced selection processes to retain outside law firms to bring PFAS-related lawsuits against certain manufacturers including the Company. In addition, the Company is in discussions with several state attorneys general and agencies, responding to information and other requests relating to PFAS matters and exploring potential resolution of some of the matters raised.\nAqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2002. As of December 31, 2022, 3,350 lawsuits (including approximately 34 putative class actions and more than 200 public water systems) alleging injuries or damages by AFFF use have been filed against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state and federal courts. As further described below, a vast majority of these pending cases are in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) court in South Carolina. Additional AFFF cases continue to be filed in or transferred to the MDL. Claims in the MDL are asserted by individuals, public water systems, putative class members, state and territorial sovereigns, and other entities. Plaintiffs seek a variety of relief in cases in the MDL, including, where applicable, damages for personal injury, property damage, water treatment costs, medical monitoring, natural resource damages, and punitive damages. The Company also continues to defend certain AFFF cases that remain in state court and is in discussions with pre-suit claimants for possible resolutions where appropriate.\nIn December 2018, the JPML granted motions to transfer and consolidate all AFFF cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. Over the past four years, the parties in the MDL have conducted substantial discovery, including ongoing master discovery and several rounds of discovery involving potential water supplier bellwether cases. In September 2022, the court selected the City of Stuart, Florida public water supplier case as the first bellwether trial, to begin in June 2023. The court has also directed the parties to submit a proposal for an initial set of personal injury bellwether cases. In September 2022, the court issued an order denying defendants MDL-wide summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense, which defense can be presented to a jury at future trials. The MDL court has repeatedly encouraged the parties to negotiate to resolve cases in the MDL. In October 2022, the court appointed a retired federal judge as mediator, who has held several initial mediation sessions with plaintiff and defense leadership in November and December 2022.\nIn June 2019, several subsidiaries of Valero Energy Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner, filed eight AFFF cases against 3M and other defendants, including DuPont/Chemours, National Foam, Buckeye Fire Equipment, and Kidde-Fenwal, in various state courts. Plaintiffs seek damages that allegedly have been or will be incurred in investigating and remediating PFAS contamination at their properties and replacing or disposing of AFFF products containing long-chain PFAS compounds. Two of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL. Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are stayed by agreement of the parties.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is aware of approximately 50 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant. 3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, at least two personal injury cases are expected to remain pending in state courts.\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of firefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial amount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\nOther PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3Ms customers improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the contamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the product. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, diminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp., Honeywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc., Georgia-Pacific LLC, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co., Chemours Co., and various carpet manufacturers.\nIn New York, 3M is defending 40 individual cases filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York and five additional individual cases filed in New York state court against 3M, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp. (Saint-Gobain), Honeywell International Inc. and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (DuPont). Tonaga, Inc. (Taconic) is also a defendant in the state court actions. Plaintiffs allege that PFOA discharged from fabric coating facilities operated by non-3M entities (that allegedly had used PFOA-containing materials from 3M, among others) contaminated the drinking water in the Village of Hoosick Falls, the Town of Hoosick and Petersburg, New York. Plaintiffs in both the federal and state individual cases assert various tort claims for personal injury and property damage and in some cases request medical monitoring. In the federal court individual cases, the parties selected 24 claimants in May 2021 for a discovery pool, which was further narrowed to eight claimants in July 2022 for expert discovery. Additionally, 3M is defending a case in New York state court filed by the Town of Petersburgh in September 2022. Plaintiff alleges that 3M and several other manufacturers contributed to PFOA contamination in the towns public water supply. 3M is also defending 13 cases in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York filed by various drinking water providers. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that products manufactured by 3M, DuPont, and additional unnamed defendants contaminated plaintiffs water supply sources with various PFAS compounds. 3M has filed answers in these cases and discovery is ongoing.\nIn Michigan, one consolidated putative class action is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against 3M and Wolverine World Wide (Wolverine). The action arises from Wolverines allegedly improper disposal of materials and wastes, including 3M Scotchgard, related to Wolverines shoe manufacturing operations. Plaintiffs allege Wolverine used 3M Scotchgard in its manufacturing process and that chemicals from 3Ms product contaminated the environment and drinking water sources after disposal. 3M and Wolverine have agreed to settle the case with the plaintiffs, and 3M's share is not considered material, pending final court approval in March 2023.\nIn Alabama and Georgia, 3M, together with multiple co-defendants, is defending two state court cases brought by municipal water utilities, relating to 3Ms sale of PFAS-containing products to carpet manufacturers in Georgia. The plaintiffs in these cases allege that the carpet manufacturers improperly discharged PFAS into the surface water and groundwater, contaminating drinking water supplies of cities located downstream along the Coosa River, including Rome, Georgia and Centre, Alabama. These water utility cases have been proceeding through discovery. The City of Rome case has been scheduled for trial in June 2023. In September 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board to resolve a similar matter. This development, as with developments on other PFAS matters, was reflected in determining changes to 3Ms accrual for PFAS-related \"other environmental liabilities.\" Another case originally filed in Georgia state court was brought by individuals asserting PFAS contamination by the Georgia carpet manufacturers and seeking economic damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of Rome and Floyd County water subscribers. This case has been removed to federal court, where the case is proceeding through discovery.\n3M, together with co-defendants, is also defending another putative class action in federal court in Georgia, in which plaintiffs seek relief on behalf of a class of individual ratepayers in Summerville, Georgia who allege their water supply was contaminated by PFAS discharged from a textile mill. In May 2021, the City of Summerville filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022. This case is now proceeding through discovery.\nIn July 2022, a putative class action was filed against 3M and other PFAS manufacturers by The Utilities Board of Tuskegee on behalf of all drinking water utilities within Alabama whose finished drinking water has contained a detectable concentration level of PFOA, PFOS, GenX, or PFBS that exceed the June 2022 health advisory levels issued by the U.S. EPA. 3M filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2022.\nIn California, 3M, Decra Roofing and certain DuPont-related entities were named as defendants in an action brought in state court by the City of Corona and a local utility authority, alleging PFAS contamination of the plaintiffs water sources and also referring to 3M's industrial minerals facility in Corona, California as a potential source of contamination. The court granted demurrers filed by Decra and the DuPont entities, while 3M answered the complaint in February 2022. The case is proceeding through discovery as to plaintiff and 3M. In June 2022, the Sacramento Suburban Water District filed a lawsuit in California federal court against 3M and certain other defendants, alleging PFAS contamination from 3M products generally. That case has now been transferred to the AFFF MDL. In October 2022, a putative class action was filed against the Company and other parties on behalf of individuals who have been drinking water from the Temescal Subbasin, from which the City of Corona gets its water, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and medical monitoring.\nIn North Carolina, the town of Pittsboro filed a lawsuit in January 2023 against 3M and other defendants in state court related to alleged PFAS contamination of its property and water supply. The complaint references AFFF as a potential source of alleged contamination.\nIn Delaware, 3M, is defending one putative class action brought by individuals alleging PFAS contamination of their water supply resulting from the operations of local metal plating facilities. Plaintiffs allege that 3M supplied PFAS to the metal plating facilities. DuPont, Chemours, and the metal platers have also been named as defendants. This case was removed to federal court, and in September 2022, the court dismissed all but plaintiffs negligence claim. Plaintiffs have filed a third amended complaint and the parties are currently negotiating a scheduling order to be proposed to the court.\nIn New Jersey, 3M is a defendant in an action brought in federal court by Middlesex Water Company, alleging PFAS contamination of its water wells. The Court denied 3Ms motion for summary judgment in October 2022 and has set a pre-trial conference for March 2023. A trial date has been set for October 2023. In September 2020, 3M was named a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought by the Borough of Hopatcong. In January 2021, 3M was named a defendant in another similar lawsuit brought by the Pequannock Township. Fact discovery has closed in both the Hopatcong and Pequannock matters, and expert discovery is set to commence in February 2023 (Hopatcong) and March 2023 (Pequannock). 3M, together with several co-defendants, is also defending 27 cases in New Jersey federal court brought by individuals with private drinking water wells near certain DuPont and Solvay facilities that were allegedly supplied with PFAS by 3M. These cases have all been coordinated for discovery, which is ongoing. Plaintiffs in ten of these cases seek medical monitoring and property damages. Plaintiffs in the 16 remaining individual cases in federal court allege personal injuries to themselves or their disabled adult children. In July 2022, Plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaints in the first five cases to add claims concerning seven non-PFAS chemistries as against defendants other than 3M. Nine of the remaining personal injury cases were filed in state court and removed to federal court. Plaintiffs are currently seeking remand in four of these cases. In three of these cases, Plaintiffs also assert claims against Clemente Property and the Covanta Waste Disposal Facility. In December 2022, an additional personal injury case was filed in New Jersey State court. 3M and Middlesex Water Company are also defending a putative class action filed in New Jersey federal court in November 2021 by individuals who received drinking water from Middlesex Water Company that was allegedly contaminated with PFAS. The court denied 3Ms motion to dismiss, and the case is proceeding through discovery. In May 2022, Middlesex Water Company filed a third-party complaint against the Company in New Jersey state court in a putative class action of the state residents who are customers of the water company, seeking indemnity from the Company. After Middlesex Water Company removed the case to federal court in July 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to state court. The federal court stayed 3Ms deadline to respond to the third-party complaint until after the motion to remand is decided. Finally, in June 2022, a personal injury lawsuit was filed against 3M by a Middlesex Water Company customer. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice and later re-filed in the MDL.\nIn South Carolina, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in South Carolina state court against 3M, DuPont and DuPont related entities in March 2022. The lawsuit alleges property damage and personal injuries from contamination from PFAS compounds used and disposed of at the textile plant known as the Galey & Lord plant from 1966 until 2016. The complaint seeks remedies including damages, punitive damages, and medical monitoring. The case has been removed to federal court. Plaintiff recently filed a second amended complaint.\nIn Massachusetts, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in August 2022 in state court against 3M and several other defendants alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by local paper manufacturing facilities. The lawsuit alleges property damage and also seeks medical monitoring on behalf of plaintiffs within the Town of Westminster. This case was removed to federal court. 3M anticipates responding to the complaint in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn Maine, a group of landowners filed a second amended complaint in October 2022 in federal district court, adding 3M and several other alleged chemical suppliers as defendants in a case previously filed against several paper mills, alleging PFAS contamination from waste generated by the paper mills. The lawsuit seeks to recover for alleged property damage.\nIn October 2018, 3M and other defendants, including DuPont and Chemours, were named in a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio brought by the named plaintiff, a firefighter allegedly exposed to PFAS chemicals through his use of firefighting foam, purporting to represent a putative class of all U.S. individuals with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood. The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order establishing an independent panel of scientists to evaluate PFAS. In March 2022, the court certified a class of \"[i]ndividuals subject to the laws of Ohio, who have 0.05 [ppt] of PFOA (C-8) and at least 0.05 ppt of any other PFAS in their blood serum.\" The judge ordered additional briefing to permit defendants to narrow the proposed nationwide class by show[ing] what states do not recognize the type of claim for relief filed by the plaintiff. In September 2022, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants request to appeal the district courts class certification order. Defendants appeal is scheduled to be fully briefed by April 2023.\nOther PFAS-related Matters\nIn July 2019, the Company received a written request from the Subcommittee on Environment of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of Representatives, seeking certain documents and information relating to the Companys manufacturing and distribution of PFAS products. In September 2019, a 3M representative testified before and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Companys environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company continues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.\nThe Company continues to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants.\nAs previously reported, the Illinois EPA in August 2014 approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results. In June 2022, the Illinois EPA provided notice of the termination of the Cordova May 2000 Site Remediation Agreement. The Company continues to perform pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results to Illinois EPA. In addition, the Company is treating its pumped groundwater at its Cordova wastewater treatment plant.\nIn Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Companys manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Companys principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a HBV or Health Risk Limit (HRL) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS compounds for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS compounds at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. In August 2009, the MPCA issued a decision adopting remedial options for the Companys Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. In the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the approved remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites, and in late 2010, 3M commenced the approved remedial option at the Oakdale site. The Company has completed remediation work and continues with operational and maintenance activities at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites. Remediation work has been substantially completed at the Cottage Grove site, with operational and maintenance activities ongoing.\nIn Alabama, as previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to remediate the presence of PFAS in the soil and groundwater at the Companys manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama associated with the historic (1978-1998) incorporation of wastewater treatment plant sludge. With ADEMs agreement, 3M substantially completed installation of a multilayer cap on the former sludge incorporation areas. Further remediation activities, including certain on-site and off-site investigations and studies, will be conducted in accordance with the July 2020 Interim Consent Order described below.\nThe Company operates under a 2009 consent order issued under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) (the 2009 TSCA consent order) for the manufacture and use of two perfluorinated materials (FBSA and FBSEE) at its Decatur, Alabama site that prohibits release of these materials into the waters of the United States. In March 2019, the Company halted the manufacture, processing, and use of these materials at the site upon learning that these materials may have been released from certain specified processes at the Decatur site into the Tennessee River. In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. During June and July 2019, the Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and treating all air emissions. These processes have been back on-line and in operation since July 2019. The Company continues to cooperate with the EPA and ADEM in their investigations and will work with the regulatory authorities to demonstrate compliance with the release restrictions.\nThe Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to a Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued by ADEM. The NPDES permit requires monthly and quarterly reporting on the quality and quantity of pollutants discharged to the Tennessee River. In June 2019, as previously reported, the Company voluntarily disclosed to the EPA and ADEM that it had included incorrect values in certain of its monthly and quarterly reports. The Company has submitted the corrected values to both the EPA and ADEM.\nAs previously reported, as part of ongoing work with the EPA and ADEM to address compliance matters at the Decatur facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit. In September 2019, the Company disclosed the matter to the EPA and ADEM temporarily idled certain manufacturing processes at 3M Decatur, and installed wastewater treatment controls. The Company restarted idled processes in October 2019.\nAs a result of the Companys discussions with ADEM to address these and other related matters in the state of Alabama, as previously reported, 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Companys Decatur facility. Under the interim Consent Order, the Companys principal obligations include commitments related to (i) future ongoing site operations such as (a) providing notices or reports and performing various analytical and characterization studies and (b) future capital improvements; and (ii) remediation activities, including on-site and off-site investigations and studies. Obligations related to ongoing future site operations under the Consent Order will involve additional operating costs and capital expenditures over multiple years. As offsite investigation activities continue, additional remediation amounts may become probable and reasonably estimable.\nAs previously reported, in December 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Northern District of Alabama for documents related to, among other matters, the Companys compliance with the 2009 TSCA consent order and unpermitted discharges to the Tennessee River. The Company is cooperating and providing responsive documents with respect to this and other inquiries regarding its manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, as previously reported, as part of its ongoing evaluation of regulatory compliance at its Cordova, Illinois facility, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cordova facility. In November 2019, the Company disclosed this matter to the EPA, and in January 2020 disclosed this matter to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), submitted an NPDES permit application for the PFAS in its discharge, and in October 2019, put on-line and in operation wastewater treatment specifically designed to treat PFAS. The Company continues to work with the EPA and IEPA to address these issues from the Cordova facility. In November 2022, the Company entered into an SDWA Administrative Consent Order that requires the Company to continue to sample and survey private and public drinking water wells within the vicinity of the Cordova facility, provide treatment of private water wells within a three-mile radius of the Cordova facility, and to provide alternate treatment/supply for the Camanche, Iowa public drinking water system.\nIn April 2022, the Company received a TSCA information request from EPA seeking information related to the operation of specific PFAS-related processes, and the Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information. In May 2022, the Company received a notice of potential violation and opportunity to confer and a notice of intent to file a complaint from EPA alleging violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) related to the use of emergency spill containment units associated with certain chemical processes at the Cordova facility.\nThe Company is also reviewing operations at its other plants with similar manufacturing processes, such as the plant in Cottage Grove, Minnesota, to ensure those operations are in compliance with applicable environmental regulatory requirements and Company policies and procedures. As a result of these reviews, as previously reported, the Company discovered it had not fully characterized its PFAS discharge in its NPDES permit for the Cottage Grove facility. In March 2020, the Company disclosed this matter to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the EPA. In July 2020, the Company received an information request from MPCA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Companys compliance with the Clean Water Act at its Cottage Grove facility.\u202fThe Company is cooperating with this inquiry and is producing documents and information in response to the request for information.\nSeparately, as previously reported, in June 2020, the Company reported to EPA and MPCA that it had not fully complied with elements of the inspection, characterization and waste stream profile verification process of the Waste and Feedstream Analysis Plan (WAP/FAP) of its RCRA permit for its Cottage Grove incinerator. The Company and MPCA resolved the issues associated with the foregoing disclosure in a May 2022 stipulation agreement, and permanently retired the Cottage Grove hazardous waste incinerator in December 2021. In connection with the now closed incinerator, the Company in December 2022 received from EPA a draft Consent Agreement and Penalty Order (CAFO) under the Clean Air Act, with a proposed civil penalty to resolve issues raised in a Finding of Violation issued in 2019. The Company is engaging with EPA in discussions towards resolving this matter. In October 2021, the Company received information requests from MPCA seeking additional toxicological and other information related to certain PFAS compounds. The Company is cooperating with these inquires and is producing documents and information in response to the requests. In June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility. The Company worked with MPCA to develop a plan to address its stormwater, which is embodied in an order issued by MPCA in December 2022.\nIn February 2020, as previously reported, the Company received an information request from EPA for documents and information related to, among other matters, the Companys compliance with the Clean Water Act at its facilities that manufacture, process, and use PFAS, including the Decatur, Cordova, and Cottage Grove facilities, and the Company has completed its production of responsive documents and information.\nThe Company continues to work with relevant federal and state agencies (including EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice, state environmental agencies and state attorneys general) as it conducts these reviews and responds to information, inspection, and other requests from the agencies. The Company cannot predict at this time the outcomes of resolving these compliance matters, what actions may be taken by the regulatory agencies or the potential consequences to the Company.\nOther Environmental Litigation\nIn July 2018, the Company, along with more than 120 other companies, was served with a complaint seeking cost recovery and contribution towards the cleaning up of approximately eight miles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey. The plaintiff, Occidental Chemical Corporation, alleges that it agreed to design and pay the estimated $165 million cost to remove and cap sediment containing eight chemicals of concern, including PCBs and dioxins. The complaint seeks to spread those costs among the defendants, including the Company. The Companys involvement in the case relates to its past use of two commercial drum conditioning facilities in New Jersey. Whether, and to what extent, the Company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined.\nFor environmental matters and litigation described above, unless otherwise described below, no liability has been recorded as the Company believes liability in those matters is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. The Companys environmental liabilities and insurance receivables are described below.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Insurance Receivables\nThe Company periodically examines whether the contingent liabilities related to the environmental matters and litigation described above are probable and reasonably estimable based on experience and ongoing developments in those matters, including discussions regarding negotiated resolutions. During 2022, as a result of ongoing review and recent developments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation, the Company increased its accrual for PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $659 million since December 31, 2021 and made related payments of $479 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded liabilities of $592 million for other environmental liabilities. The accruals represent the Companys best estimate of the probable loss in connection with the environmental matters and PFAS-related matters and litigation described above. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded liabilities of $29 million for estimated non-PFAS related environmental remediation costs to clean up, treat, or remove hazardous substances at current or former 3M manufacturing or third-party sites. The Company evaluates available facts with respect to each individual site each quarter and records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Companys commitment to a plan of action. Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. Developments may occur that could affect the Companys current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the Companys operations and products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. For sites included in both environmental remediation liabilities and other environmental liabilities, at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the Company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the Company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the associated established accruals for the reasons described above.\nThe Company has both pre-1986 general and product liability occurrence coverage and post-1985 occurrence reported product liability and other environmental coverage for environmental matters and litigation. As of December 31, 2022, the Companys receivable for insurance recoveries related to the environmental matters and litigation was $8 million. Various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this and future expected increases in the receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers, and (iv) the scope of the insurers purported defenses and exclusions to avoid coverage.\nProduct Liability Litigation\nAearo Technologies sold Dual-Ended Combat Arms - Version 2 earplugs starting in about 2003. 3M acquired Aearo Technologies in 2008 and sold these earplugs from 2008 through 2015, when the product was discontinued. 3M and Aearo Technologies believe the Combat Arms Earplugs were effective and safe when used properly, but nevertheless, as discussed below, face litigation from approximately 232,000 claimants. As noted in the \"Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies\" section above, in July 2022, the Aearo Entities voluntarily initiated chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeking court supervision to establish a trust, funded by the Company, to efficiently and equitably satisfy all claims determined to be entitled to compensation associated with these matters and those described in the earlier section \"Respirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation - Aearo Technologies\". 3M entered into an agreement with the Aearo Entities to fund this trust and to support the Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M has committed $1.0 billion to fund this trust and has committed an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will provide additional funding if required by the Aearo Entities. Related to these actions, which represent a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2 earplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities, 3M reflected a pre-tax charge of $1.2 billion (within selling, general and administrative expenses), inclusive of fees and net of related existing accruals, in the second quarter of 2022.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy proceedings, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities in the third quarter of 2022, resulting in a charge that was not material to 3M. Upon the filings in late July 2022 in the U.S Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana, all litigation against Aearo Entities that filed chapter 11 cases is automatically stayed.\nThe Aearo Entities have also requested that the Bankruptcy Court confirm that Combat Arms Earplugs litigation against the Company is also stayed or order it enjoined. In August 2022, the Bankruptcy Court denied Aearos motion for a preliminary injunction to stay all Combat Arms related litigation against 3M. In September 2022, the bankruptcy judge certified Aearos request to appeal the decision directly to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and in October the Seventh Circuit accepted the appeal. In December 2022, Aearo filed its opening brief with the Seventh Circuit appealing the bankruptcy courts decision. Also in December 2022, the parties to the Aearo bankruptcy agreed to extend the exclusivity period for Aearo to file a plan for reorganization to March 31, 2023. Confidential mediation is underway with court-appointed mediators and settlement discussions between Aearo and the plaintiffs are ongoing. As noted in the co-mediators' report issued on January 20, 2023, 3M continues to support Aearo Entities by engaging in confidential mediation discussions toward a resolution of the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation in the chapter 11 process. In February 2023, the plaintiffs filed with the Bankruptcy Court a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy filings of Aearo Entities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 3M's consolidated balance sheet reflected amounts associated with the deconsolidated Aearo Entities as follows:\n$0.7 billion asset balance in equity and other investments (within other assets), reflecting 3M's equity investment interest in the entities.\n$0.6 billion net liability for former intercompany amounts due from 3M to the deconsolidated entities. The gross balances are reflected in other liabilities ($0.9 billion) and other assets ($0.3 billion).\n$1.2 billion accrued liability related to the commitments describe above, largely reflected within contingent liability claims and other (within other liabilities) on 3M's consolidated balance sheet.\nPreceding Combat Arms Earplugs matters:\nIn December 2018, a military veteran filed an individual lawsuit against 3M in the San Bernardino Superior Court in California alleging that he sustained personal injuries while serving in the military caused by 3Ms Dual-Ended Combat Arms earplugs - Version 2. The plaintiff asserts claims of product liability and fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment. The plaintiff seeks various damages, including medical and related expenses, loss of income, and punitive damages.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company is a named defendant in lawsuits (including 14 putative class actions) in various state and federal courts that purport to represent approximately 141,000 individual claimants making similar allegations. The significant increase from year-end 2021 in the number of claimants is largely due to the number of claims moved from the administrative docket to the active docket as the result of the transition orders the multi-district litigation (MDL) judge began issuing at the end of 2021 (as more fully described below), in addition to claims filed directly on the active docket in 2022. In April 2019, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted motions to transfer and consolidate all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida to be managed in an MDL proceeding to centralize pre-trial proceedings. The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor defense. In July 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs summary judgment motion and denied the defendants summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs claims are not barred by the government contractor defense. The court denied the Companys request to immediately certify the summary judgment ruling for appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to consolidate three plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which began in March 2021.\nIn April 2021, 3M received an adverse jury verdict in the first bellwether trial. The jury awarded the three plaintiffs less than $1 million in compensatory damages and $6 million in punitive damages for a total of $7 million. 3M appealed the verdicts, challenging, among other rulings, the MDL court's denial of 3Ms motion to assert the government contractor defense. The next two bellwether trials occurred in May and June of 2021. In May 2021, 3M received a verdict in its favor in the second bellwether trial, in which a jury rejected claims that 3M knowingly sold earplugs with design defects. In June 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the third bellwether trial. The jury found 3M liable for strict liability failure to warn, but found 3M not liable for design defect or fraud. The jury apportioned fault 62 percent to 3M and 38 percent to the plaintiff for a total damage award of approximately $1 million. 3M appealed the verdict. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument for the appeals of the first and third bellwether trials for the week of May 1, 2023. In October 2021, 3M received an adverse verdict in the fourth bellwether trial, in which a jury awarded $8 million to the plaintiff. 3M received verdicts in its favor in the fifth and sixth bellwether trials. 3M received an adverse verdict in the seventh and eighth bellwether trials, in which the juries awarded the plaintiffs $13 million and $23 million, respectively. A post-trial order reduced the award in the seventh bellwether trial to $8 million. 3M prevailed in the ninth and tenth bellwether cases but received adverse verdicts in the eleventh bellwether case in which the jury awarded each of the two plaintiffs $15 million in compensatory and $40 million in punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory and punitive damages award to one of the plaintiffs from $55 million to $22 million. 3M received adverse verdicts in the twelfth and thirteenth bellwether cases in which the jury awarded one plaintiff with $50 million and another with $8 million in compensatory damages. 3M prevailed in the fourteenth bellwether trial. Plaintiff in the fourteenth bellwether trial has filed a notice of appeal. In December 2022, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed her Eleventh Circuit appeal of a jury verdict in favor of 3M and Aearo. No other cases that resulted in a defense verdict are on appeal before the Eleventh Circuit at this time. In April 2022, a jury returned a plaintiffs verdict in the fifteenth bellwether trial, awarding $2.2 million in compensatory damages and declining to award punitive damages. A post-trial order reduced the compensatory damages award to $1.2 million. In May 2022, a jury returned a plaintiffs verdict in the last scheduled federal bellwether trial. The jury awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $72 million in punitive damages. These trials have not included several bellwether cases that plaintiffs' counsel dismissed with prejudice either during discovery or after being set for trial. The Company's appeals to the Eleventh Circuit from the adverse verdicts are proceeding forward, with oral argument on the first two appeals scheduled for May 2023. Other than the Company's funding commitment for its Aearo subsidiaries' chapter 11 proceedings as described above, no liability has been recorded for the Combat Arms earplugs litigation because the Company believes any such liability is not probable and reasonably estimable and the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss at this time. Following conclusion of the bellwether trial process and unsuccessful settlement discussions, and with another 2,000 cases being prepared for trial while the Company's appeals are still pending, the Aearo Entities and the Company adopted a change in strategy for managing these alleged litigation liabilities that led to the Aearo Entities initiating the chapter 11 proceedings as discussed above. An administrative docket of approximately 90,700 unfiled and unverified claims has also been maintained at the MDL court. The MDL court in August 2021 provided notice of an intent to issue forthcoming transition orders requiring all claims be moved off the administrative docket to the active docket on a rolling basis over 12 months. The orders will provide that any case not moved to the active docket will be dismissed without prejudice, and the administrative docket will then be closed. The MDL court also ordered the parties to prepare for trial 2,000 cases in four waves of 500 cases over the next 14 months. After the preparation of these cases is completed, the cases will be remanded to the federal district courts where the cases were originally filed. In October 2022, the MDL court ordered that while the successor liability issue described below is on appeal, all wave discovery would be stayed, the transition of cases from the administrative docket to the active docket would stop, and that monthly settlement conferences involving all parties (except Aearo) would occur in the MDL. In January 2023, the MDL judge ordered that the MDL mediation would stop while the bankruptcy court mediation is ongoing.\nThe court ordered a three-day mediation in July 2022; and again in September 2022, a two-day mediation session. The court also set the date for a single plaintiff trial for October 2022, which was postponed to February 2023, and then stayed. In August 2022, subsequent to Aearos chapter 11 filing, the MDL court issued an order prohibiting 3M from attempting to relitigate issues in the bankruptcy court and from financially supporting any collateral dispute regarding the MDL courts previous rulings. 3M has appealed the order to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and made a motion to stay the order pending appeal. In October 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted 3Ms motion to stay the order pending appeal. In January 2023, the Eleventh Circuit scheduled oral argument for this appeal for the week of May 1, 2023.\nIn September 2022, two MDL plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking to permanently enjoin 3M from transferring assets, issuing dividends or completing the announced spin-off of its Health Care business, to allegedly preserve assets for the Combat Arms claimants. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and an opposition to the injunction motion. In December 2022, the court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Also in December 2022, the MDL court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment that successor liability, claiming that 3M is fully and independently liable for injuries allegedly caused by the CAEv2 and certified the order for appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. In January 2023, 3M sought the Eleventh Circuits acceptance of the appeal. 3M is also defending lawsuits brought primarily by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal court, and the federal court remanded them to state court in March 2020. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in October 2021 that the cases brought by non-military plaintiffs were properly remanded to state court, whereas the cases brought by military contractor plaintiffs who had received the Combat Arms Earplugs from the military should have remained in federal court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit granted 3M's unopposed motion to vacate the remand orders in the remaining appeals of military service member cases. The military service member cases are expected to be remanded to federal court and transferred to the MDL. There are approximately 40 lawsuits involving approximately 1,000 plaintiffs pending in the state court. The state court cases are subject to a bellwether case selection process. The first trial in Hennepin County was scheduled for October 2022, but has been postponed to July 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company was a named defendant in approximately 5,258 lawsuits in the United States and one Canadian putative class action with a single named plaintiff, alleging that the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system caused a surgical site infection.\nAs previously disclosed, 3M is a named defendant in lawsuits in federal courts involving over 5,000 plaintiffs alleging that they underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system. The plaintiffs seek damages and other relief based on theories of strict liability, negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, failure to warn, design and manufacturing defect, fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation/concealment, unjust enrichment, and violations of various state consumer fraud, deceptive or unlawful trade practices and/or false advertising acts.\nThe U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated all cases pending in federal courts to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota to be managed in a multi-district litigation (MDL) proceeding. In July 2019, the court excluded several of the plaintiffs causation experts, and granted summary judgment for 3M in all cases pending at that time in the MDL. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Plaintiffs also appealed a 2018 jury verdict in favor of 3M in the first bellwether trial in the MDL and appealed the dismissal of another bellwether case. A panel of the appellate court in August 2021 reversed the district courts exclusion of the plaintiffs causation experts and the grant of summary judgment for 3M. The Company sought further appellate en banc review by the full Eighth Circuit court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit court denied 3Ms petition for rehearing en banc. In February 2022, the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court. In May 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court declined 3Ms request to review the Eighth Circuit courts decision. The MDL court has not yet issued a new case management order.\nIn February 2022, the MDL court ordered the parties to engage in any mediation sessions that a court-appointed mediator deems appropriate. Mediation sessions took place in May and August 2022 without success in resolving the litigation. Separately, in August 2021, the Eighth Circuit court affirmed the 2018 jury verdict in 3Ms favor in the only bellwether trial in the MDL.\nIn addition to the federal cases, there are five state court cases. Three are pending in Missouri state court and combine Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. One of the Missouri cases was tried in September and October of 2022; the jury returned a verdict in 3Ms favor on all the claims. Another Missouri case is scheduled for trial in 2024. There is also one case in Etowah County, Alabama that combines Bair Hugger product liability claims with medical malpractice claims. 3M resolved for an immaterial amount the final state court case, which was filed in Hidalgo County, Texas.\nAs previously disclosed, 3M had been named a defendant in 61 cases in Minnesota state court. In January 2018, the Minnesota state court excluded plaintiffs experts and granted 3Ms motion for summary judgment on general causation. The Minnesota Court of Appeals affirmed the state court orders in their entirety and the Minnesota Supreme Court denied plaintiffs petition for review and entered the final dismissal in 2019, effectively ending the Minnesota state court cases.\nIn June 2016, the Company was served with a putative class action filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for all Canadian residents who underwent various joint arthroplasty, cardiovascular, and other surgeries and later developed surgical site infections that the representative plaintiff claims were due to the use of the Bair Hugger\u2122 patient warming system. The representative plaintiff seeks relief (including punitive damages) under Canadian law based on theories similar to those asserted in the MDL.\nFor product liability litigation matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the established accruals at this time.\nSecurities and Shareholder Litigation\nIn July 2019, Heavy & General Laborers Locals 472 & 172 Welfare Fund filed a putative securities class action against 3M Company, its former Chairman and CEO, current Chairman and CEO, and former CFO in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In August 2019, an individual plaintiff filed a similar putative securities class action in the same district. Plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements regarding 3M's exposure to liability associated with PFAS and bring claims for damages under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 against all defendants, and under Section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 against the individual defendants. In October 2019, the court consolidated the securities class actions and appointed a group of lead plaintiffs. In January 2020, the defendants filed a motion to transfer venue to the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. In August 2020, the court denied the motion to transfer venue, and in September 2020, the defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In November 2020, the federal Court of Appeals granted 3Ms petition for a writ of mandamus and directed the New Jersey federal court to transfer the action to the Minnesota federal court. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action in January 2021, and in September 2021, the Minnesota federal court granted 3Ms motion to dismiss the securities class action, which judgment is now final.\nIn October 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives and directors. In November and December 2019, two additional derivative lawsuits were filed in a Minnesota state court. The derivative lawsuits rely on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The Minnesota state court cases were consolidated and stayed pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in the securities class action, and the Minnesota state plaintiffs have agreed to further stay their action pending a decision on the motion to dismiss the federal derivative lawsuit discussed below. In October 2020, the derivative action pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey was dismissed, without prejudice, for failure to serve the complaint within the required time period.\nIn August 2020, a stockholder who had previously submitted a books and records demand filed an additional follow-on derivative lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against 3M and several of its current and former executives and directors. This derivative lawsuit, having been transferred to Minnesota federal court, also relies on similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. In February 2021, an additional stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the District of Minnesota, making similar factual allegations as the putative securities class action discussed above. The Minnesota federal court consolidated these federal derivative suits and stayed them pending and through any appeal of the securities class action dismissal. The Minnesota federal plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint in February 2022. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated federal derivative action in May 2022. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss in August 2022 and the defendants filed their reply brief in October 2022. Oral argument was held in January 2023.\nFederal False Claims Act / Qui Tam Litigation\nIn October 2019, 3M acquired Acelity, Inc. and its KCI subsidiaries, including Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. As previously disclosed in the SEC filings by the KCI entities, in 2009, Kinetic Concepts, Inc. received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. In 2011, following the completion of the governments review and its decision declining to intervene in two qui tam actions described further below, the qui tam relator-plaintiffs pleadings were unsealed.\nThe government inquiry followed two qui tam actions filed in 2008 by two former employees against Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and KCI USA, Inc. (collectively, the KCI defendants) under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. As 3M has previously disclosed, one qui tam action (the Godecke case) was dismissed in January 2022. In the remaining action (the Hartpence case), the complaint contains allegations that the KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for V.A.C.\u00ae Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors and seeks monetary damages.\nIn June 2019, the district court entered summary judgment in the KCI Defendants favor on all of the relator-plaintiffs claims. The relator-plaintiff then filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument in the Hartpence case was held in July 2020. The appellate court issued an opinion in August 2022 reversing the decision of the district court and remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court held a status conference in January 2023 where no case deadlines were set; the litigation remains in a pre-trial stage.\nFor the matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the Companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nCompliance Matter\nThe Company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising from marketing efforts by certain business groups based in China. The Company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws. The Company has retained outside counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the investigation. In July 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating with both agencies. The Company is in discussions related to potential resolution but cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome or actions that may be taken by the Department of Justice or Securities and Exchange Commission.\nNOTE 17. Leases\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost $ 295 $ 319 $ 348\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of assets 15 15 21\nInterest on lease liabilities 2 2 1\nVariable lease cost 135 127 101\nTotal net lease cost $ 447 $ 463 $ 471\nShort-term lease cost and income related to sub-lease activity is immaterial for the Company.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\n(Millions unless noted) Location on face of Balance Sheet 2022 2021\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right of use assets Operating lease right of use assets $ 829 $ 858\nCurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities - current 261 263\nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities Operating lease liabilities 580 591\nTotal operating lease liabilities 841 854\nFinance leases:\nProperty and equipment, at cost Property, plant and equipment 218 223\nAccumulated amortization Property, plant and equipment (accumulated depreciation) (126) (117)\nProperty and equipment, net 92 106\nCurrent obligations of finance leases Other current liabilities 11 7\nFinance leases, net of current obligations Other liabilities 75 93\nTotal finance lease liabilities $ 86 $ 100\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years):\nOperating leases 5.5 5.5\nFinance leases 6.3 6.6\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases 2.2 % 1.8 %\nFinance leases 3.1 % 3.3 %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases is as follows:\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 295 $ 317 $ 326\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 2 2 1\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 25 19 58\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities:\nOperating leases 261 342 250\nFinance leases 6 3 18\nSale leased-back activity in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was not material.\nMaturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022\n(Millions) Finance Leases Operating Leases\n2023 $ 19 $ 268\n2024 18 192\n2025 11 131\n2026 9 83\n2027 7 55\nAfter 2027\n26 162\nTotal 90 891\nLess: Amounts representing interest 4 50\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments 86 841\nLess: Current obligations 11 261\nLong-term obligations $ 75 $ 580\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has additional operating lease commitments that have not yet commenced of approximately $14 million. These commitments pertain to 3Ms right of use of certain buildings.\nNOTE 18. Stock-Based Compensation\nAt the May 2021 Annual Meeting, the shareholders approved the Amended and Restated 3M Company 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which included an increase of 26,633,508 in the number of shares available for issuance. Awards may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining shares available for grant under the LTIP Program are 32 million and there were approximately 8,357 participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.\nThe Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February to provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. The grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on the grant date. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. Employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed ten years of service. This retiree-eligible population represents 36 percent of the annual grant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter.\nIn addition to the annual grants, the Company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. The Company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. These grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the Company.\nAmounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and the General Employees Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP), are provided in the following table. Capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2020\nCost of sales $ 48 $ 47 $ 50\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 169 185 169\nResearch, development and related expenses 46 42 43\nStock-based compensation expenses 263 274 262\nIncome tax benefits (62) (100) (82)\nStock-based compensation expenses (benefits), net of tax $ 201 $ 174 $ 180\nStock Option Program\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during the year ended December 31:\n2022 2021 2020\n(Options in thousands) Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Number of Options Weighted Average Exercise Price\nUnder option -\nJanuary 1 34,560 $ 163.52 35,401 $ 156.23 33,675 $ 151.15\nGranted 3,776 162.39 3,612 175.04 4,777 157.25\nExercised (2,101) 98.91 (4,163) 110.20 (2,759) 93.23\nForfeited (729) 176.21 (290) 182.63 (292) 181.33\nDecember 31 35,506 166.97 34,560 163.52 35,401 156.23\nOptions exercisable\nDecember 31 28,210 $ 167.42 26,956 $ 161.25 27,537 $ 149.67\nStock options generally vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at ten years from date of grant. As of December 31, 2022, there was $45 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option based awards. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 21 months. For options outstanding at December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 57 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $28 million. For options exercisable at December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 46 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $28 million.\nThe total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $116 million, $325 million and $206 million, respectively. Cash received from options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $205 million, $457 million and $256 million, respectively. The Companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $24 million, $69 million and $44 million, respectively.\nFor the primary 2022 annual stock option grant, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions that follow.\nStock Option Assumptions\nAnnual\n2022 2021 2020\nExercise price $ 162.41 $ 175.04 $ 157.24\nRisk-free interest rate 1.9 % 0.8 % 1.5 %\nDividend yield 2.9 % 2.8 % 2.7 %\nExpected volatility 21.8 % 22.6 % 19.7 %\nExpected life (months) 83 83 78\nBlack-Scholes fair value $ 25.34 $ 25.33 $ 21.58\nExpected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. For the 2022 annual grant date, the Company estimated the expected volatility based upon the following three volatilities of 3M stock: the median of the term of the expected life rolling volatility; the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility; and the implied volatility on the grant date. The expected term assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity during the year ended December 31:\n2022 2021 2020\n(Shares in thousands) Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\nNonvested balance -\nAs of January 1 1,987 $ 175.96 1,722 $ 189.78 1,573 $ 201.11\nGranted\nAnnual 1,102 160.24 822 176.82 733 157.29\nOther - - - - 45 159.49\nVested (557) 197.48 (462) 228.94 (570) 176.20\nForfeited (157) 169.22 (95) 176.13 (59) 196.31\nAs of December 31\n2,375 164.07 1,987 175.96 1,722 189.78\nRestricted stock units granted generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. Dividend equivalents equal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3M common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although no dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. Dividends are paid out in cash at the vest date on restricted stock units. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $108 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 23 months. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $88 million, $83 million and $91 million, respectively. The Companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $17 million, $16 million and $17 million, respectively.\nPerformance Shares\nInstead of restricted stock units, the Company makes annual grants of performance shares to members of its executive management. The 2022 performance criteria for these performance shares (organic sales growth, free cash flow growth, and earnings per share growth) were selected because the Company believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value. The number of shares of 3M common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the Company during such performance period. When granted, these performance shares are awarded at 100% of the estimated number of shares at the end of the three-year performance period and are reflected under Granted in the table below. Non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3M executive. The performance share grants accrue dividends; therefore, the grant date fair value is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Since the rights to dividends are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. Weighted average performance shares whose performance period is complete are included in computation of diluted earnings per share.\nThe following table summarizes performance share activity during the year ended December 31:\n2022 2021 2020\n(Shares in thousands) Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value\nUndistributed balance -\nAs of January 1 481 $ 175.12 423 $ 188.61 444 $ 205.58\nGranted 269 144.77 166 176.79 203 153.16\nDistributed (116) 207.49 (115) 228.80 (206) 190.84\nPerformance change (196) 153.15 40 176.35 25 166.49\nForfeited (47) 155.71 (33) 171.35 (43) 172.92\nAs of December 31\n391 157.98 481 175.12 423 188.61\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $7 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average earnings period of 19 months. The total fair value of performance shares that were distributed were $21 million, $22 million, and $35 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the distribution of performance shares were $4 million, $4 million, and $7 million per year for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGeneral Employees Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):\nAs of December 31, 2022, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Companys GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $21.20, $27.80 and $23.47, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $31 million in 2022, $32 million in 2021, and $31 million in 2020.\nNOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n3Ms businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3Ms four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. In July 2022, 3M announced its intention to spin off the Health Care business as a separate public company (see Note 3 for additional information). Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in Corporate and Unallocated).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3Ms chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3Ms disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss) ) was updated. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Companys business segments. The changes included the items described below. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\nEffective in the first quarter of 2022:\nEliminating inclusion of dual credit in measure of segment operating performance\n3M business segment operating performance measures were updated to no longer include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management previously evaluated its business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting. 3M reflected additional (dual) credit to another business segment when the customer account activity (sales district) with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer was provided by a different business segment. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) previously would also have received credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting was reflected as a reconciling item entitled Elimination of Dual Credit, such that sales and operating income in total were unchanged.\nReflecting certain litigation-related costs in the Safety and Industrial segment's operating performance measure\n3M's business segment operating performance measure with respect to its Safety and Industrial business segment was updated relative to litigation-related costs for non-Aearo and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters. Previously, 3M included these costs, when significant, as a special item (as further described below) within Corporate and Unallocated. 3M changed to include all litigation-related costs associated with respirator mask/asbestos litigation matters (along with other Safety and Industrial matters already included therein, such as those related to Combat Arms Earplugs) within the Safety and Industrial business segment. Note, however, that prospectively during the Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 - see Note 16) net costs for significant litigation associated with Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\nBusiness Segment Products\nBusiness Segment Representative revenue-generating activities, products or services\nSafety and Industrial Industrial abrasives and finishing for metalworking applications\nAutobody repair solutions\nClosure systems for personal hygiene products, masking, and packaging materials\nElectrical products and materials for construction and maintenance, power distribution and electrical original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)\nStructural adhesives and tapes\nRespiratory, hearing, eye and fall protection solutions\nNatural and color-coated mineral granules for shingles\nTransportation and Electronics Advanced ceramic solutions\nAttachment tapes, films, sound and temperature management for transportation vehicles\nPremium large format graphic films for advertising and fleet signage\nLight management films and electronics assembly solutions\nPackaging and interconnection solutions\nReflective signage for highway, and vehicle safety\nHealth Care Health care procedure coding and reimbursement software\nSkin, wound care, and infection prevention products and solutions\nDentistry and orthodontia solutions\nFiltration and purification systems\nConsumer Consumer bandages, braces, supports and consumer respirators\nCleaning products for the home\nRetail abrasives, paint accessories, car care DIY products, picture hanging and consumer air quality solutions\nStationery products\nSome seasonality impacts this business segment related to back-to-school, generally in the third quarter of each year\nBusiness Segment Information\n(Millions)\nNet Sales 2022 2021 2020\nSafety and Industrial $ 11,604 $ 11,981 $ 10,972\nTransportation and Electronics 8,902 9,262 8,406\nHealth Care 8,421 8,597 7,832\nConsumer 5,298 5,513 4,976\nCorporate and Unallocated 4 2 (2)\nTotal Company $ 34,229 $ 35,355 $ 32,184\nOperating Performance 2022 2021 2020\nSafety and Industrial $ 1,199 $ 2,466 $ 2,588\nTransportation and Electronics 1,012 1,880 1,701\nHealth Care 1,815 2,037 1,662\nConsumer 994 1,162 1,119\nTotal business segment operating income 5,020 7,545 7,070\nCorporate and Unallocated\nCorporate special items:\nNet costs for significant litigation (877) (214) (148)\nDivestiture costs (60) - -\nGain on business divestitures 2,724 - 389\nDivestiture-related restructuring actions (41) - (55)\nRussia exit charges (109) - -\nTotal corporate special items 1,637 (214) 186\nOther corporate expense - net (118) 38 (95)\nTotal Corporate and Unallocated 1,519 (176) 91\nTotal Company operating income 6,539 7,369 7,161\nOther expense/(income), net 147 165 366\nIncome before income taxes $ 6,392 $ 7,204 $ 6,795\nAssets Depreciation & Amortization Capital Expenditures\n(Millions) 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nSafety and Industrial $ 11,730 $ 11,744 $ 566 $ 593 $ 562 $ 512 $ 339 $ 451\nTransportation and Electronics 6,453 6,999 410 419 429 562 453 454\nHealth Care 13,343 14,055 623 636 626 272 249 251\nConsumer 2,753 2,783 148 147 140 146 109 120\nCorporate and Unallocated 12,176 11,491 84 120 154 257 453 225\nTotal Company $ 46,455 $ 47,072 $ 1,831 $ 1,915 $ 1,911 $ 1,749 $ 1,603 $ 1,501\nAssets subject to attribution to business segments largely include accounts receivable; inventories; property, plant and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; and certain limited other assets. All other items are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. Accounts receivable and inventory are attributed based on underlying sales or activity. Property, plant and equipment are attributed to a particular business segment based on that items primary user while certain items such as corporate-shared headquarters/administrative centers, laboratories, distribution centers and enterprise software systems are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. Intangible assets and goodwill are largely directly associated with a particular reporting unit and attributed on that basis. Business segment depreciation reflected above is based on the underlying usage of assets (while the particular asset itself may be entirely reflected within a different business segments asset balance as its primary user). This depreciation also includes allocated depreciation associated with a number of the assets reflected in Corporate and Unallocated as described above.\nCorporate and Unallocated\nCorporate and Unallocated operating income includes corporate special items and other corporate expense-net. Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation associated with Combat Arms Earplugs and Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters during the chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022) and with PFAS-related other environmental matters (see Note 16). Corporate special items also include divestiture costs, gain/loss on business divestitures (see Note 3), divestiture-related restructuring costs (see Note 5), and Russia exit costs (see Note 15). Divestiture costs include costs related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from transition supply, manufacturing, and service arrangements with Neogen Corporation following the 2022 split-off of 3M's Food Safety business and with the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\nGeographic Information\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - net\n(Millions) 2022 2021\nAmericas $ 6,066 $ 5,864\nAsia Pacific 1,389 1,582\nEurope, Middle East and Africa 1,723 1,983\nTotal Company $ 9,178 $ 9,429\nUnited States net property, plant and equipment (PP&E) was $5,662 million and $5,484 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\na.The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nb.The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\nc.There was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. The gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The implementation of a worldwide ERP system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.\nThe Company completed implementation with respect to various processes/sub-processes in certain subsidiaries/locations, including aspects relative to the United States, and will continue to roll out the ERP system over the next several years. As with any new information technology application we implement, this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. We concluded, as part of its evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation of the ERP system in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nDisclosure Under Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012\nThe Company is making the following disclosure under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act:\nProtection of Intellectual Property Rights in Iran Pursuant to Specific License\nAs part of its intellectual property (IP) protection efforts, 3M has obtained and maintains patents and trademarks in Iran.
