    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nThe Company\nWith a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,400 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the Regulated Businesses. The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and are collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.\nOn December 9, 2021 (the Closing Date), the Company sold all of the equity interests of the HOS subsidiaries. See Item 1 - Business-Market-Based Businesses-Sale of Homeowner Services Group below and Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary, see Item 1 - Business-Regulated Businesses-Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc. below and Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, our, the Company, and American Water mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to parent company mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries.\nRegulated Businesses\nThe Companys primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Companys utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states in the United States, with 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Companys utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (PUCs). Federal, state and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,384 million for 2021, $3,255 million for 2020 and $3,094 million for 2019, accounting for 86%, 86% and 86%, respectively, of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods.\nPresented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves, by type of service, for and as of the year ended December 31, 2021:\nOperating Revenues (in millions) Number of Customers (in thousands)\nWater (a) Wastewater Total % of Total Water Wastewater Total % of Total\nNew Jersey $ 778 $ 48 $ 826 24.4 % 660 55 715 20.3 %\nPennsylvania 688 82 770 22.8 % 677 82 759 21.5 %\nMissouri 337 12 349 10.3 % 474 17 491 13.9 %\nIllinois 303 37 340 10.0 % 295 69 364 10.3 %\nCalifornia 265 3 268 7.9 % 187 3 190 5.4 %\nTotal-Top Five States (b)\n2,371 182 2,553 75.4 % 2,293 226 2,519 71.4 %\nNew York (c)\n127 - 127 3.8 % 127 - 127 3.6 %\nOther (d)\n678 26 704 20.8 % 849 35 884 25.0 %\nTotal Regulated Businesses $ 3,176 $ 208 $ 3,384 100.0 % 3,269 261 3,530 100.0 %\n(a)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.\n(b)The Companys Top Five States are determined based upon operating revenues.\n(c)The Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary on January 1, 2022.\n(d)Includes the Companys utility operations in the following states: Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia and other revenue attributable collectively to the Regulated Businesses. The Company completed the sale of its Michigan subsidiary on February 4, 2022.\nCustomers\nThe Companys Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other entity that purchases the Companys water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the Companys services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.\nThe vast majority of the Companys regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers water usage, typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Companys wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.\nResidential customers make up a substantial portion of the Companys customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i) commercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers.\nThe following chart depicts the allocation of the Companys Regulated Businesses operating revenue of $3,384 million by type, including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer, for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n(a)Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts.\n(b)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.\nPresented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the Company served by class as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which represents approximately 14 million people served as of December 31, 2021:\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands) Water Wastewater Water Wastewater Water Wastewater\nResidential 2,972 245 2,948 236 2,914 215\nCommercial 225 15 225 15 222 13\nFire service 52 - 50 - 49 -\nIndustrial 4 - 4 - 4 -\nPublic and other (a)\n16 1 17 1 16 1\nTotal 3,269 261 3,244 252 3,205 229\n(a) Includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts. Bulk contracts, which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above, generally result in service to multiple customers.\nCustomer growth in the Companys Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.\nCapital Investment\nThe Company plans to invest between $28 billion and $32 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its Regulated Businesses water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2026, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026. In addition, from 2022 to 2026, the Companys capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. The benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida, when the Companys New Jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. Specifically, the New Jersey subsidiarys Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant, which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018, withstood a record flood and continued to provide potable water supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey.\nRegulation and Rate Making\nThe operations of the Companys Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.\nPeriodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utilitys need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize regulatory lag, which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utilitys revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change.\nThe Companys Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:\nRegulatory Practices Description States Allowed\nInfrastructure replacement surcharge mechanisms Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe and reliable services for the Companys customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency. IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA, WV\nFuture test year A test year is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be effective. The use of a future test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis. CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, PA, TN, VA\nHybrid test year A historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year allows an update to historical data for known and measurable changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. MD, MO, NJ, WV\nUtility plant recovery mechanisms Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects. CA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VA\nExpense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utilitys control, to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding. CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA\nRevenue stability mechanisms Adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility recovers the revenues authorized in its general rate case, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. CA, IL\nConsolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state, and is generally used to moderate the price impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements. CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, PA, VA, WV\nDeferred accounting A regulators willingness to defer recognition of financial impacts when setting rates for utilities. All\nThe Company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Companys proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Companys strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist.\nAcquisitions and Strategic Growth\nThe U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the countrys wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates, as of 2017, that there are approximately 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.\nA fundamental aspect of the Companys growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses, see Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Companys regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the Companys existing management (although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all, of the employees of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Companys current customer mix of 93% water and 7% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers, as well as a line of sight to grow the Companys base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.\nIncreasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements, among others, that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.\nSale of New York American Water Company, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (Liberty), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 20, 2019, as amended, by and among the Company, the Companys New York subsidiary and Liberty (the Stock Purchase Agreement), Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Companys New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Companys regulated New York operations had approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIndustry Legislation\nOn November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJA) was signed into law and provides for up to $55 billion to aid in improving the countrys ailing water infrastructure, including $23.4 billion for drinking water and wastewater, $15 billion for lead service line replacement (through the drinking water state revolving fund), and $10 billion for the treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and other contaminants of emerging concern. The bill also includes a low-income assistance program, which provides eligible low-income customers who receive their water from public and private entities to be eligible to participate in the program. The Company is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds.\nIn December 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief and $1.4 trillion U.S. government appropriations package for 2021, which included $638 million for a low-income water assistance program and $2.8 billion for capitalization grants under the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.\nIn 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the WQAA), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey, including municipal and investor-owned utilities with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. Enhanced WQAA legislation includes additional enforcement requirements for disclosure of results, requires the sale of systems for prolonged violations and imposes new cyber security requirements and asset management plans. The new amendments, which provide for both civil and criminal penalties for falsification of documents, were signed by the Governor with an effective date of November 8, 2021.\nIn 2018, Indiana passed a law to set minimum operational expectations for all water and wastewater utilities in the state, including municipal and investor-owned utilities. The law requires water and wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses, develop capital asset management plans and conduct cybersecurity and water loss audits. It also requires water and wastewater utilities to participate in regional discussions and planning to assess opportunities for the more efficient use of water and wastewater utility assets and infrastructure. Water and wastewater utilities that fail to comply with the requirements of the law may be ineligible for grants and loans from the State Revolving Fund. Under the law, all new municipal and investor-owned utilities are required to be regulated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for ten years from inception of operations.\nIn 2020, Missouri enacted the Water Safety and Security Act, which requires small and medium-sized water providers to create cybersecurity, valve inspection and hydrant inspection programs. Upon request by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the water providers must certify compliance with all regulations regarding water quality sampling, testing and reporting, hydrant and valve testing and reporting and cybersecurity plans and procedures.\nThe Companys regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have access to utility valuation legislation and regulation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval. In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that create a mechanism to value water and wastewater assets based upon replacement cost new less depreciation.\nConsolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high-quality services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Companys regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\nCompetition\nThe Companys Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, CPCNs) issued by state PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However, the Companys Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, the Companys largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, include Essential Utilities, Inc., Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy and Corix.\nCondemnation and Eminent Domain\nAll or portions of the Regulated Businesses utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.\nAs such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California successfully added Measure J to the November 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the MPWMD) should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets (the Monterey system assets) of the Companys California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. In August 2019, the MPWMDs General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition; (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of feasible as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition; and (5) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.\nIn November 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. On June 12, 2020, the MPWMD issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets and a related district boundary adjustment that would be required if the MPWMD were to acquire and operate certain of the Monterey system assets located outside the MPWMDs boundaries. On September 15, 2020, the MPWMD gave notice of its intention to appraise the Monterey system assets and related property interests. On September 29, 2020, the Companys California subsidiary declined to make the Monterey system assets and related property interests available for inspection or to comply with any of the other requests contained in the MPWMDs notice. On October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a final environmental impact report (FEIR), and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the MPWMDs project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. On November 25, 2020, the Companys California subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court. A hearing on the matter was held on August 30, 2021, and on November 19, 2021, the court denied the petition. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings-Challenge of Certification-Proposed Monterey System Final Environmental Impact Report.\nOn February 26, 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (LAFCO) seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMDs boundaries. On June 28, 2021, LAFCOs commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. On December 6, 2021, LAFCOs commissioners denied the MPWMDs application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. On January 5, 2022, LAFCOs commissioners confirmed the denial. On January 31, 2022, the MPWMD filed an application for reconsideration of LAFCOs confirmation of denial. A hearing on the application has been set for February 28, 2022.\nAlso, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the Company in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports. A valuation trial was originally scheduled for October 2021 but has been continued to June 2022.\nFurthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.\nWater Supply and Wastewater Services\nThe Companys Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.\nPresented in the chart below are the Companys sources of water supply as of December 31, 2021:\nPresented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Companys Top Five States for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nSurface Water Ground Water Purchased Water\nNew Jersey 74% 22% 4%\nPennsylvania 91% 7% 2%\nMissouri 78% 21% 1%\nIllinois 54% 35% 11%\nCalifornia - 65% 35%\nThe Companys ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of the Companys service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.\nThe Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. The Company reviews current climate science and global models related to temperature, precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis. Where actionable forecasts are available, the Company will use this information in its comprehensive planning studies and asset management plans. These studies and plans, which are used by the Company to develop its asset management and system reliability strategies, assess the climate risk and resiliency of the Companys water and wastewater systems over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number of different factors, projections and estimates.\nIn connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. In California, where the state has been experiencing a multi-year drought, the Company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as various long-term purchase water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years. An example of the Companys use of long-term planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the Water Supply Project) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by the Companys California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiarys purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the GWR Project) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the SWRCB). For more information, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings-Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions and Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies-Contingencies-Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.\nSeasonality\nCustomer demand for the Companys water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Companys jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulated Businesses-Regulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.\nMarket-Based Businesses\nThe Companys Market-Based Businesses provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers, and previously provided home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its former HOS business, which was sold on December 9, 2021. These businesses are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Companys Market-Based Businesses were $563 million for 2021, $540 million for 2020 and $539 million for 2019, accounting for 14%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Companys total operating revenues for the same periods.\nMSG enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations. MSG is the Companys remaining primary market-based business.\nThe Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group (CSG).\nMilitary Services Group\nMSG operates on 17 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installations water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installations mission, and the construction of these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Companys debt or equity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Armys implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing. However, recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year period after project completion. Three of MSGs current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity.\nThe contract price for six of MSGs contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 11 contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called Economic Price Adjustment. All 17 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the MSG subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs. MSGs backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $6.2 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 41 years.\nSale of Homeowner Services Group\nThe Company has provided various warranty protection programs and other home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its HOS operations. On the Closing Date, the Company sold all of the equity interests in its HOS subsidiaries to an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the Buyer), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion. See Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCompetition\nMSG faces competition from a number of service providers, including American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation\nThe Companys water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by both its Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. For example, while the EPA has issued a non-enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection was the first state agency to establish a standard for perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for PFOA and PFOS, with implementation occurring in January 2021. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.\nThe Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources, recognizing that drinking water standards have generally, over time, increased in number and become increasingly more stringent. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Companys capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $850 million over the next five years, including $180 million in 2022, for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Companys operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Companys water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the Company. The Companys facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder.\nSafe Drinking Water Act\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous, naturally occurring and manufactured chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.\nTo help formulate the basis for future regulations, the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional, unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the Monitoring Rule). The Companys facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, including the fourth round that concluded at the end of 2020. There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which lack a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or cost-effective treatment options. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Research and Development-Contaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information.\nTo effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers exposure to disinfectants and/or the by-products of their use in the disinfection process. Examples of these rules are the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (the Long-Term 2 Rule), the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule, the Ground Water Rule, which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources and the revised Total Coliform Rule, which implemented a find and fix process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPAs time frame for compliance with all of these standards, which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements. Recent monitoring as required by the Long-Term 2 Rule has indicated that up to 30 of the Companys surface water systems have recently completed or need to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against Cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection systems, and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $100 million to $150 million of investment will still be required to upgrade the remaining facilities for Cryptosporidium disinfection. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2022.\nThe Company conducted over 10 million water quality and turbidity tests in 2021 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPAs voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 67 of the Companys surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA programs prestigious Director award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, the Company accounts for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 66 of the Companys surface water treatment plants have received the Five-Year Phase III award, 62 plants have received the Ten-Year Phase III award, 57 plants have received the Fifteen-Year Phase III award, and 39 plants have received the Twenty-Year Phase III award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of the Companys surface water plants have received the Presidents award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnerships rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards and have maintained this status for at least five years.\nAlthough it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.\nLead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act\nIn 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines (LSLs) in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA finalized revisions to the LCR (the Revised LCR) on January 15, 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Company is executing an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, which were originally mandated by January 2024 but have been delayed until at least late 2024 pending EPA additional review. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the Revised LCR will be determined once the EPA completes its additional review, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.\nThe Company currently estimates that less than 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line. The Company is replacing LSLs as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The Companys goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by the end of 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal. The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line replacement through drinking water state revolving funds. The Company is awaiting further guidance on eligibility, the application process and the distribution of these funds. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Companys planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Companys preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the Revised LCR. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.\nClean Water Act\nThe Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to the Companys wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on the Companys operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Companys facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.\nResearch and Development\nThe Companys Research and Development Program\nThe Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (R&D) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its compliance activities, improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Waters R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the teams expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to COVID-19, PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, enteric viruses, and various bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Companys R&D personnel are located at the Companys corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports the Companys R&D activities through testing and analysis.\nThe Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards and regulations. This relationship includes the sharing of the Companys research, such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. The Companys engagement with the EPA provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements. The Company also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research foundations. The Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth.\nContaminants of Emerging Concern\nContaminants of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as PFAS, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disrupting compounds and industrial chemicals, as well as certain naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the publics health is not fully understood and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the publics perception of drinking water quality.\nThe Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 192 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that can affect humans. The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Companys efforts include:\nmonitoring impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on environmental virus loads and removal efforts through wastewater systems;\ncharacterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their mitigation;\nusing its research findings to communicate information to its customers regarding potential actions to limit occurrences of Legionella in their buildings; in this regard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems in large buildings;\ndefining a framework to support management or possible future regulation of opportunistic pathogens;\ndeveloping expanded monitoring methods for PFAS compounds and piloting treatment techniques;\nleading a PFAS risk communication strategy for the water sector;\nusing innovative technologies to detect and manage algal blooms to help prevent taste and odor events and cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;\nmonitoring of taste and odor issues that impact customer satisfaction using expanded analytical methods to detect compounds, and evaluating and recommending treatment practices;\nimplementing water source assessment tools, including sensors and data analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the identification of source water contamination events;\ndeveloping methodology and advanced measurement techniques for contaminants of emerging concern to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and\nimplementing activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange treatment to seek to control contaminants of emerging concern.\nService Company and Security\nAmerican Water Works Service Company, Inc. (Service Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that provides support and operational services to the Company and its affiliates. These services are predominantly provided to the Companys Regulated Businesses under contracts that have been approved by PUCs, where necessary, and are also provided to its Market-Based Businesses as requested or may otherwise be necessary.

Services are provided by Service Company at cost, enabling the Companys operating subsidiaries to fulfill their responsibilities in a cost-effective manner, while providing them access to in-depth, functional expertise.\nThe Companys security team provides oversight and policy guidance on physical, cyber and information security, as well as business continuity, throughout its operations. It is responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring and supporting effective physical and technical security controls for the Companys physical assets, business systems and operational technologies. Risk assessments are conducted periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for additional safeguards, security controls and measures. Operational and technical security controls are deployed and integrated as safeguards against unauthorized access to the Companys information systems. These controls are aimed at (i) assuring the continuity of business processes that are dependent upon automation, (ii) maintaining the integrity of the Companys data, (iii) supporting regulatory and legislative compliance requirements, and (iv) maintaining safe and reliable service to the Companys customers. The Company engages in partnerships with U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of its water delivery systems and to safeguard its water supply and operations.\nEnvironmental, Social Responsibility and Governance\nThe Company considers environmental, social responsibility and governance (ESG) principles fundamental to its corporate strategy and values. Integration of these principles into the Companys daily operations emphasizes its belief that how a company operates is just as important as what a company does. The Companys vision and values drive its strategies, which are centered on five central themes:\nSafety-The safety of the Companys employees and customers is the number one focus for American Water.\nCustomers-The Companys customers are at the center of everything it does, helping the Company to shape its strategic priorities.\nPeople-Maintaining an environment that is open, transparent, diverse and inclusive, and where the Companys people feel valued, included and accountable, is critical to the Companys ability to serve its customers every day.\nOperational Excellence-The Company strives to find better and more efficient ways to do business, and to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for its customers.\nGrowth-The Company believes that through growth, it can invest in creating more jobs, better training and benefits, and improved infrastructure in its communities. The Companys growth also creates greater efficiencies of scale and drives improved customer affordability, which benefits all of its stakeholders, including shareholders.\nIn 2021, the Company issued its sixth biennial Sustainability Report, covering its sustainability performance for calendar years 2020 and 2019. This report can be accessed on the Companys website. In addition, the Company issued its first annual Inclusion & Diversity Report, which shares the inclusion and diversity strategies, practices, policies, and programs from across the business. The Companys values and actions have achieved prestigious recognition by many leading firms devoted to recognizing companies that demonstrate ESG leadership. Most recently, the Company received the highest S&P Global Ratings ESG Evaluation score given to a U.S. company and the third highest globally, and was ranked 19th within Barrons list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies. Additionally, the Company was included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year, and the Company recently achieved the ranking of sixth on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World index.\nThe following goals and actions highlight the Companys commitment to embedding ESG principles throughout its business:\nEnvironmental and Sustainability\nEnergy and Emissions for the Companys Regulated Businesses\nThe Company clarified its existing goal to reduce by more than 40% its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025, from a 2007 baseline, as an absolute measurement of its scope 1 (direct) emissions, and scope 2 (indirect, derived from the Companys purchases of energy) emissions.\nThe Company lowered its GHG emissions through December 31, 2020 by approximately 36% since its base year of 2007. GHG emissions data for the full calendar year 2021 is expected to be released in April 2022.\nWater Efficiency and Resiliency for the Companys Regulated Businesses\nThe Company established a water efficiency goal to meet customer needs while saving 15% in water volume delivered per customer by 2035, compared to a 2014 and 2015 averaged baseline. The Company has lowered its water delivery per customer over the last three years. The Company reduced its water volume delivered per customer compared to a 2015 baseline by 5.0%, 5.3% and 4.3% as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company has further utilized a uniform water system resiliency metric, the Utility Resilience Index (URI), to track enhancements in the Companys ability to prepare for, respond to, remediate and effectively manage incidents impacting its operations. The Company plans to increase its URI weighted average by 10% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline. The URI is a part of the American Water Works Associations J-100 voluntary consensus risk and resilience standard and focuses on a utilitys ability to manage incidents affecting its customers, employees and assets, and return to normal operations as quickly as possible.\nApproximately 10-12% of the Companys total projected capital investment over the next five years is dedicated to resiliency, accounting for approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion allocated to renewing and improving assets of the Regulated Businesses.\nPolicy Leadership\nThe Company employs a team of R&D scientists dedicated to partnering with water research organizations on water quality and technology-based source water monitoring.\nThe Company collaborates and partners with federal and state agencies to support effective environmental, health and safety and water quality standards and regulations.\nSocial Responsibility\nCustomers\nFor 2021, the Company achieved an aggregate customer satisfaction rating in the top quartile among the Companys industry peer group.\nTo better reflect the customers that the Company serves, the Company increased spend with diverse suppliers and small businesses in 2021 by more than 10% year over year.\nEmployees\nDuring 2021, over 109,000 hours of safety training were completed by the Companys employees.\nThe Company has made significant progress toward its zero injuries goal, reducing workplace injuries by 66% since 2015. Through year end 2021, the Company has further reduced its OSHA recordable injury rate (ORIR) to 0.97, the lowest in the Companys recorded history, which is approximately two times better than the water industry average.\nDuring 2021, approximately 86% of the Companys job requisitions had a diverse candidate pool, with approximately 58% of transfers or promotions filled by diverse individuals.\nIn 2021, the Company named Cheryl Norton as its first female Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.\nCommunities\nIn December 2021, the Company authorized the contribution of $45 million to the American Water Charitable Foundation (AWCF), a 501(c)(3) private foundation established by American Water in 2010.\nMore than $941 thousand was donated in 2021 by the Companys employees and the AWCF through workplace giving campaigns including the United Way, Water For People and other volunteering giving campaigns that supported more than 1,500 public charities nationwide.\nGovernance\nBoard and Committees\nThe Board of Directors and each of its standing committees are led by an independent, non-executive chairperson.\nThe Board of Directors met 14 times in 2021.\nThe Board of Directors reflects gender, racial and experiential diversity. As of December 31, 2021, 54.5% of the Companys directors voluntarily self-identified as female or racially diverse.\nThe Companys average director tenure was approximately 7.2 years as of December 31, 2021.\nDemonstrated and Representative Expertise\nThe members of the Companys Board of Directors have demonstrated expertise, including, among others, experience in utility and finance operations, customer service, cybersecurity, the military, financial services and capital markets, service as a public company CEO, CFO and/or board member, and management of global operations.\nTransparency\nThe Company discloses on its website its Political Contributions Policy and, on an annual basis, information related to its political contributions and lobbying expenditures.\nThe Company makes available on its website its ESG goals and achievements.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOverview\nThe Companys people are a critical part of its business, and the Companys investment in its people begins with recruitment of qualified and diverse talent. The Company believes that representing the communities in which it serves plays a key role in its ability to serve its customers and improves its talent. The Company promotes an inclusive culture where its employees are given the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential and understand that they directly contribute to the Companys ability to operate, grow and serve its customers. The Company believes that investing in the safety, health and well-being of its employees is a key component of its people and culture goals, and that these investments in its people allow employees to generate great ideas, provide quality customer service and make a difference in the lives of the Companys customers.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nA longstanding value and strategy of the Company is safety. In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and contractors so that they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Company strives for all employees to feel emotionally safe, live a healthy lifestyle and be physically safe at work and at home. The Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure performance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Companys employees and contractors.\nTo uphold the Companys commitment to safety, the Companys employees completed over 100,000 hours of employee safety training during 2021. Additionally, through frequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open exchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking the time they need to complete a task safely and to use Stop Work Authority - the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe - to personally mitigate the hazard or issue or collaborate with management to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so important that it is stated on the back of every employees identification badge.\nFor 2021, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving a 2% reduction compared to 2020, even though labor hours increased by 5%. Also, the number of injuries for purposes of the Companys Days Away Restricted or Transferred (DART) rate decreased by 14% compared to 2020. For 2021, the Companys ORIR was 0.97 (64 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.54 (36 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.99 (63 injuries) and a DART rate of 0.63 in 2020.\nIn 2021, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by achieving internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner, increased by 27% in 2021 over 2020, and 99% of near miss incident corrective actions were completed within 30 days, meeting the Companys 2021 goal. The Company utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance.\nUnderstanding that some employees may have delayed seeking preventative or other medical care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a 2021 priority for the Company was to encourage employees to increase their utilization of preventative exams. Through the Companys marketing efforts and targeted incentives in its myWellness program, the Company sought to encourage employees to take preventative health actions. The number of total preventative care exams completed by the Companys employees increased by 15% during 2021 compared to 2020.\nSupporting Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAmerican Water remains committed to the health, well-being and safety of its employees and families, as well as its customers and communities. The Companys Emergency Crisis Response Team (ECRT) continued to deploy a COVID-19 contact tracing program to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at work. The ECRT consistently monitors current events and the latest public health guidance and adjusts workplace safety measures and the Companys COVID-19 guidance accordingly. During the pandemic, American Water provided temporary medical and emotional health benefits, including paid time off and emergency leave. The Company also supported employees and their families during the uncertainty of the pandemic by providing additional resources, such as enhanced well-being support, workplace flexibility, back-up dependent care, caretaker database discounts and academic support. American Water did not lay off any employees due to the pandemic.\nAs an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to focus on the care and safety of its employees, contractors, vendors and others who work at or visit the Companys worksites. In 2021, as COVID-19 vaccines became more readily available, the Company began planning for the reintegration of those who had been working remotely back to its work facilities, and also began to implement safety protocols based on current COVID-19 health guidance for the return of employees to perform work in customers homes. Furthermore, the Company has continued to support employee health and safety by providing safety training and resources, continuing to enforce safety protocols such as maintaining social distancing, requiring the use of face coverings at work, and encouraging good hygiene and frequent handwashing and cleaning of work areas. The Company continues to receive input from its employees via pulse surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also helped to shape the Companys pandemic-related responses and a flexible return to hybrid work where possible. Throughout the fall of 2021, managers and employees who had been working remotely during the pandemic began to return to the Companys offices and facilities with increasing frequency, in preparation for a three-day in-person, two-day remote work week, where feasible.\nInclusion, Diversity and Equity\nIn 2021, the Company continued to evolve its inclusion and diversity strategic framework to include equity. The Company defines equity as fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancement for all people, while also eliminating barriers that may prevent some groups from full participation. The Company promotes an environment where inclusion, diversity and equity are embedded in its culture. At all levels, the Company strives to understand, respect, value and provide equal opportunity to each employee. The Company seeks to foster an environment where employees differences are embraced and celebrated. The Company holds as an essential concept the right of employees to proudly share their ideas and unique perspectives in an environment built on mutual respect, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, by reflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves. The Company expects all of its leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity.\nDuring 2021, the Company published its first Inclusion & Diversity Report. The report shares the Companys diversity strategies, practices, policies and programs from across the business and includes more than 100 data points related to building a culture of inclusion. The following graphic highlights the Companys principal employee inclusion, diversity and equity metrics for 2021 based on its employee headcount as of January 1, 2022, and which are based on responses from employees who voluntarily self-reported this information to the Company.\nDuring 2021, 85.6% of the Companys hiring candidate pools were diverse. For this purpose, diversity refers to gender, race, ethnicity, disability and/or veteran/military status, based on voluntary, self-identified employee information.\nThe Company maintains active memberships with groups such as Hiring our Heroes, Military Spouse Employment Partnership, American Corporate Partners, CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, Disability:IN, Paradigm for Parity, and Out and Equal, to further enhance its ability to recruit and retain diverse employees. Among this years recognitions, the Company was designated as a 2021 Military Friendly\u00ae Top 10 Gold Employer and recognized by Military Times for its industry-leading efforts on hiring and supporting U.S. military veterans. The Company was also a top scorer in the 2021 Disability Equality Index for the third consecutive year and was recognized by U.S. Veterans Magazine as a veteran-friendly company and as an organization with a veteran-friendly supplier diversity program.\nIn keeping with the Companys values, the Company does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or retaliation by or toward any employee, vendor, customer or other person in its workplace. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and inclusion and diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to all employees, which includes education on using the Companys anonymous hotline for reporting potential Code of Ethics violations.\nIn 2021, the Company launched four employee business resource groups (EBRGs), which represent diverse employee demographics (Women, African American/Black, LGBTQ+ and Disabilities) throughout the Company. EBRGs offer opportunities for employees to share ideas and best practices, and to create measurable and long-lasting positive impacts on the Companys culture. The Companys Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Council oversees the formation, goals and actions of the EBRGs to support the Companys inclusion diversity and equity priorities.\nTo further its commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity, and in response to feedback from employees about work-life balance, in 2021, the Company announced a new Inclusion Holiday Swap benefit, to allow the opportunity for all employees to swap a Company holiday with another day of their choosing that more closely reflects their personal values, beliefs or culture. In addition, the Company is evaluating the implementation of workforce diversity goals in certain of its compensation programs.\nTotal Rewards\nEmployees are considered the Companys greatest assets and the Company views their overall well-being to be as important as their physical safety. American Waters health and well-being programs aim for employees to go home in the same or better condition than when they came to work. Health and well-being programs are approached holistically by offering the following benefits, among others: medical, prescription, dental, vision, disability and life insurance coverage, as well as a health and wellness program and a menu of additional voluntary benefits. The Companys Total Rewards programs are designed to reflect many aspects of employee health and well-being, cultivate an inclusive workforce and motivate, attract and retain talent to seek to achieve the Companys strategic business priorities.\nAs part of Total Rewards, the Company provides a comprehensive compensation and benefit program designed to recognize the vital roles the Companys employees play. Further, all of the Companys employees, including those who are union-represented,\nparticipate in the Companys Annual Performance Plan, to promote alignment in bonus compensation to the Companys short-term performance goals. Moreover, all employees who average 30 hours or more per week receive full-time benefits. Approximately 90% of all benefit eligible employees are enrolled in the Companys healthcare benefits. Full-time employees pay approximately 16% of the total cost of medical, dental and vision coverage. The Company offers its non-union employees who average 20 to 30 hours per week medical, dental and vision coverage at 50% of the total cost. Additional medical benefits include coverage for applied behavior analysis, autism treatment, transgender services and hearing aids, as well as a fertility assistance benefit to assist employees in building a family. The Company also offers additional employment benefits, including holiday, vacation and sick time, which are at levels generally greater than or equal to those offered by other companies in the utility industry. For example, the Company offers its employees up to two weeks of paid leave in connection with the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child, or to take care of a sick family member.\nThe Company believes that good emotional and mental health is fundamental, and offers a behavioral health benefit to assist employees and their families to maintain their well-being. Additionally, the Company offers an employee assistance program (EAP) that provides all employees and their eligible dependents with access to a variety of support resources free of charge. The EAP provides confidential support through its Work-Life Specialists to help individuals who are experiencing a variety of challenges, including financial, legal, family and emotional needs. The EAP provides guidance, resources and expert referrals based on an individuals needs. In addition, the Company provides all employees and their families with access to an interactive online wellness program that supports and encourages a healthy lifestyle both at work and at home. In 2021, the Company enhanced its internal myWellness website to include additional tools and activities for employees, including customized programs and action cards tailored to an individuals self-identified health needs.\nTalent Development\nThe Company provides learning opportunities and work experiences to equip its employees with the tools, skills, and competencies they need to operate safely and effectively and to grow professionally. To this end, the Company has established an Employee Experience and Talent Development team to help develop and deploy programs that are designed to attract, motivate, develop and retain talented employees, and foster a learning culture. The Company requires every employee, including its union-represented employees, to complete a minimum of 25 hours of training each year (an increase in the 20-hour requirement for 2020). Approximately 98% of active full-time employees hired before October 1, 2021 met this requirement for 2021, with over 331,000 hours of total training completed during the year, including approximately 109,000 hours of safety training. In addition to required role-based training, managers assist employees to identify professional development opportunities to help them reach their full potential and grow their careers. Additionally, in 2021, approximately 58% of the Companys internal employee transfers and promotions were diverse (defined as female, minority, disability, military, military spouse, and LGBTQ+ status, based on voluntary employee self-identification), which reflects the Companys commitment to employee development and career growth as well as the Companys focus on diversity, inclusion and equity, and a desire for its employees to reflect the communities in which it operates.\nDeveloping talent and ensuring a pipeline to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2021, the Company engaged in succession planning activities for the Companys critical positions and executive leaders. These succession plans aid in providing continued leadership for the growth and future of the Companys business, while also seeking to promote diversity, retention and development. In addition to succession of executive leadership roles, in 2022, the Company plans to focus on talent reviews, which will include identification of critical skill and competency areas, a focus on diverse emerging talent, and a discussion of strengths, gaps, and development plans. Talent reviews will be conducted for a select group of employees, including employees who are being assessed for senior leadership or other critical roles.\nEmployee Experience\nThe Companys employee value proposition (EVP) focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employees opinions and emotional response about the Company as an employer. The Company continually seeks to shape and refine its employee experience, and therefore its EVP, by offering an inclusive employee culture, employee development opportunities and competitive compensation and benefits. In developing its current EVP, the Company identified components that it believes are important to its employees and then solicited and received feedback from over 400 Company employees on those components to understand better the aspects that they value from their employer. From this employee outreach, and as a part of its EVP, the Company developed weCare, which is comprised of the following five components: deeper connections, personal growth, shared purpose, flexibility and well-being.\nWorkforce Data\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had approximately 6,400 employees. For 2021, the Companys employee turnover rate, which the Company defines as the ratio of the number of separated employees to the 12-month average headcount during 2021, was 13.1%, up from 7.4% in 2020. American Water seeks to reduce employee turnover by assessing its EVP and through its efforts to foster the Companys employee experience.\nAs of January 1, 2022, approximately 47% of the Companys workforce was represented by unions, which include 73 collective bargaining agreements with 14 different unions. Additionally, in 2022, the Company has begun to negotiate two new collective bargaining agreements, which would cover approximately 180 employees. During 2022, 21 of the Companys collective bargaining agreements are set to expire in accordance with their terms and the Company expects to be able to negotiate these agreements during the year. The Company collaborates with union leadership on topics such as safety, customer, technology and employee benefits in forums such as the Joint Healthcare Committee, National Labor Management Committee and the annual Labor Management Conference.\nBoard Oversight\nThe Executive Development and Compensation Committee (ED&CC) of the Board of Directors establishes and reviews the Companys overall compensation philosophy and oversees the compensation and benefits plans and programs for its executive officers. The ED&CC oversees the process of planning for executive officer succession. It also provides oversight of the Companys inclusion, diversity and equity programs and initiatives. Further, the ED&CC is responsible for reviewing and assessing, at least annually, the Companys culture and related culture engagement, its organizational and leadership development plans and programs, and its programs designed to identify, attract and retain high-potential employees.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nPresented in the table below are the name, age, offices held and business experience for each of the Companys executive officers, as of February 16, 2022:\nName Age Office and Experience\nM.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects. Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations\nOur Regulated Businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our Regulated Businesses also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these regulatory requirements.\nOur Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses, including, but not limited to, operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate increase applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or may be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, a PUC may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to:\ncover our expenses, including purchased water and costs of chemicals, fuel and other commodities used in our operations;\nenable us to recover our investment; and\nprovide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment.\nApproval by the PUCs is also required in connection with other aspects of our Regulated Businesses, which are required to have numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain cases, affiliated transactions. Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.\nPUCs and other governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, emergency or other actions in light of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic that may impact us, including prohibiting the termination of service for non-payment and extending or delaying procedural schedules in our regulatory proceedings. We are unable to predict the range of impacts that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other related events may have on our ability to obtain these approvals as needed or requested by our Regulated Businesses in the ordinary course or at all, or the nature or impacts of any further emergency or other action that may be taken by the PUCs or other governmental authorities.\nIn any of these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected. Even if the rates approved are sufficient, we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state PUCs. This could occur if certain conditions exist, including, but not limited to, water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates, customers increase their conservation efforts, or we experience unanticipated impacts of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates.\nOur operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations, including with respect to contaminants of emerging concern, compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures, and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs, as well as damage to our reputation.\nOur regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our Market-Based Businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These requirements include, among others, CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the LCR, and other federal and state requirements. For example, state PUCs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver. If we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards, or otherwise violate environmental laws, regulations or permits, or other health and safety and water quality regulations, we could incur substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions or costs, as well as damage to our reputation. In the most serious cases, regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our\noperating assets to another utility or to a municipality. Given the nature of our business which, in part, involves providing water service for human consumption, any potential non-compliance with, or violation of, environmental, water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry.\nIn addition, CERCLA authorizes the EPA to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances, and can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, on responsible parties for the costs thereof. We are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations.\nWe incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental, water quality and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations and their enforcement, have become more stringent over time, and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs. Although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our Regulated Businesses through customer rates, there can be no guarantee that the various state PUCs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our Regulated Businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may also incur liabilities if, under environmental laws and regulations, we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination, including potential releases of hazardous chemicals, such as chlorine, which we use to treat water, or at off-site locations where we have disposed of residual waste or caused an adverse environmental impact. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.\nAttention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds; bacteria, microbes, viruses (including the coronavirus), amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants, and our role is to provide service that meets these standards, if any. In some of our states, PUCs may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created and/or discovered, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.\nLimitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water, our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services.\nOur ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water. As a general rule, sources of public water supply, including rivers, lakes, streams, groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources, are held in the public trust and are not generally owned by private interests. As a result, we typically do not own the source water that we use in our operations, and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights (determined by legislation or court decisions) and passing-flow requirements set by governmental entities or by entering into water purchase agreements. These requirements, which can change from time to time, and vary by state or region, may adversely impact our water supply. Supply issues, such as drought, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. If we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nFor example, in our Monterey County, California operations, we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply, principally to comply with an October 2009 cease and desist order (the 2009 Order), as amended by a July 2016 order (the 2016 Order), of the SWRCB that requires our California subsidiary to significantly decrease its diversions from the Carmel River in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminated on December 31, 2021 (the 2021 Deadline). See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings-Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, which includes additional information regarding this matter. We are also required to augment our Monterey County sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. Beginning in January 2022, Cal Am currently expects that it will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirement schedule contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years\nwill depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order may result in material additional costs or obligations, including fines and penalties against our California subsidiary in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nService disruptions caused by severe weather conditions, climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nService interruptions due to severe weather, climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses. These include, among other things, storms, freezing conditions, high wind conditions, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, landslides, drought, wildfires, coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions, including those in or near designated flood plains, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and epidemics, severe electrical storms, sinkholes and solar flares. Weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities, limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers, or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage. Tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not provide reimbursement to us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.\nGovernment restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services, even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas. Governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system. Responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions, rationing restrictions, water conservation regulations, and requirements to minimize water system leaks. While expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant PUC determines they were reasonable and prudent, we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will, in fact, be fully recovered. Moreover, reductions in water consumption, including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior, may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise.\nThe issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as:\nincreased frequency and duration of droughts;\nincreased precipitation and flooding;\nincreased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events;\nchallenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels;\npotential degradation of water quality;\ndecreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns;\nincreases in disruptions in service;\nincreased costs to repair damaged facilities; or\nincreased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems.\nBecause of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit GHG emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring, and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. Although some or all potential expenditures and costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our Regulated Businesses could be recovered through rates, infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms, there can be no assurance that state PUCs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such\nexpenditures and costs, in whole or in part.\nThe current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay, also known as regulatory lag, from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements, incur increased operating expenses as a result of inflation or other factors, incur increased cost of capital, including as a result of increasing short- and long-term rates, or experience declining water usage, to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications; our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business.\nThere is typically a delay, known as regulatory lag, between the time our Regulated Businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates. In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, two of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utilitys revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 10 of our state PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as replacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates. Furthermore, in setting rates, nine of our state PUCs allow us to use future test years, which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues, expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis. Other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control, such as purchased water costs, property or other taxes, or power, conservation, chemical or other expenditures. These mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without the mechanisms.\nWhile these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek approval of regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms may not continue in their current form, or at all, or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future. Although we intend to continue our efforts to seek state PUC approval of constructive regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, or even if partially successful, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our Regulated Businesses is uncertain. Changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws and regulations, changes in enforcement practices of regulators, government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees. Therefore, elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes of the individuals who serve as regulators and changes in the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve. New laws or regulations, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, changes in agency policy, including those made in response to shifts in public opinion, or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences, among others:\nmaking it more difficult for us to increase our rates and, as a consequence, to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return;\nchanging the determination of the costs, or the amount of costs, that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings;\nrestricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts;\nrequiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers;\nlimiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems, purchase or dispose of assets, or issue long-term debt or equity, or making it less cost-effective for us to do so;\nnegatively impacting, among other things: (i) tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws, (ii) the availability or amount of, or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of, tax credits or tax abatement benefit, (iii) the amount of taxes owed, (iv) the timing of tax effects on rates or (v) the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards;\nchanging regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area;\nincreasing the associated costs of, or difficulty complying with, environmental, health, safety, consumer privacy, water quality, and water quality accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject;\nchanging or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock;\nmaking it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes;\nplacing limitations, prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates, including Service Company and any of our other subsidiaries;\nrestricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers, streams, reservoirs or aquifers; and\nrevoking or altering the terms of a CPCN issued to us by a state PUC or other governmental authority.\nRegulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities.\nThe wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks. If collection, treatment or disposal systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our wastewater systems have commercial and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type, character and strength of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge into our systems. The failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could, in turn, negatively impact our operations, damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements. Liabilities resulting from such exceedance events could adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our Regulated Businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, may cause our customers, particularly industrial and large commercial customers, to curtail operations. A curtailment of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer. In more severe circumstances, the decline in usage could be permanent. Any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Tariffs in place with respect to our Regulated Businesses may not reimburse us, in whole or in part, for any of these impacts.\nOur Regulated Businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments, experience increases in short- and long-term interest rates or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects.\nThe water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive. We invest significant amounts of capital to add, replace and maintain property, plant and equipment, and to improve aging infrastructure. In 2021, we invested $1.8 billion in net Company-funded capital improvements. The level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and, we believe, will increase. We expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations (including, among other things, a portion of the net proceeds from the sales of HOS and our New York subsidiary), borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of long-term debt and equity. We may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper, long-term debt and equity capital markets, when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to obtain sufficient financing, we may be unable to maintain our existing property, plant and equipment, fund our capital investment strategies, meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments. Even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures, we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time, as a result of supply chain interruptions, construction delays, permitting delays, labor shortages or other disruptions, environmental restrictions, legal and\nregulatory challenges, or other obstacles. Each of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including water and sewer mains, pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities. Additionally, we may have limited information regarding buried and newly acquired assets, which could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices. Assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure. Failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and O&M costs, and negatively impact our future O&M efficiency ratio. In addition, failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nSeasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues.\nThe volume of water we sell during the warmer months, typically in the summer, is generally greater than during other months, due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other applications. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature, rainfall levels and rainfall frequency. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nTwo of our jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a general rate case, regardless of sales volume. Revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism, our operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality.\nContamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies, and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations, government enforcement actions, damage to our reputation and private litigation.\nThe water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system, or the water service that is provided to our customers, may be subject to contamination, including, among other items, contamination from naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from manufactured sources (such as perchlorate, perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds, methyl tertiary butyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, lead and other materials, or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source), and possible terrorist attacks or other similar incidents. In addition, new categories of contaminants continue to emerge in the water industry. If one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated, depending on the nature of the contamination, we may have to take responsive actions that could include, among other things (1) limiting use of the water supply under a Do Not Use protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection, or (2) interrupting the use of that water supply, in whole or in part, potentially impacting basic sanitation and fire protection needs. If service is disrupted, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. In addition, we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods. We may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance, customer rates, tariffs or contract terms, and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner. Moreover, we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for information on certain pending lawsuits related to interruptions of water service.\nSince we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers, contamination of the water supply, or the water service provided to our customers, could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers, employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation. Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, pollution, and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. We may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms. Negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances within the water supply or distributed finished drinking water. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses, and are subject to deductibles and other limitations. Pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions.\nOur business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and, as a result, we are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of water service, wastewater and related or ancillary services, the quality of water provided, and the amount, timeliness, accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of these and other incidents may render legislatures and other governing bodies, state PUCs and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative, regulatory and economic outcomes, as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements. Unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our Military Services Group, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe properties of our Regulated Businesses segment include 76 dams, the majority of which are earthen dams. The failure of any of these dams could result in personal injury and property damage, including without limitation downstream property damage, for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future.\nWe also are required from time to time to decommission, repair or upgrade the dams that we own. The cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material. The federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams, which also could entail material costs. Although in most cases the PUC has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation, we might not be able to recover costs of repairs, upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future. The inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nAny failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes, water mains and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes, water mains and storage systems located across the United States. A failure of major pipes, mains or reservoirs could result in injuries, property and other damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes, mains and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators, including state PUCs with jurisdiction over our operations, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future. Moreover, to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance, they may not be recovered through rate adjustments.\nAn important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems, which involves risks, including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers, which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current, and move into new, service areas. We may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. Further, competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities, governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business.\nThe negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our managements time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in, among other things:\nincurrence or assumption of debt, contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations, including liabilities that were unknown or undisclosed at the time of acquisition;\nfailure to recover acquisition premiums;\nunanticipated capital expenditures;\nfailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;\nthe need to successfully integrate the acquired systems operations and water quality, cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures;\nrecording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges;\nfluctuations in quarterly results;\nunanticipated acquisition-related expenses;\nfailure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements; and\ndifficulties in integrating or assimilating personnel, benefits, services and systems.\nSome or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business. The systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated revenue, return on equity or profitability, or other perceived synergies, and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations, reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe compete with governmental entities, other regulated utilities, and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities. As consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions continues to increase, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions.\nOur Regulated Businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process, which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition.\nMunicipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the United States, and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our Regulated Businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain, or another similar authorized process. A municipality, other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process, either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition.\nFor example, in November 2018, Monterey, California ballot Measure J, which was added by a citizens group, was certified as having been approved by a public vote, requiring the MPWMD to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the Monterey system assets without an additional public vote. The public vote led to the issuance by the MPWMD in November 2019 of a preliminary report finding, among other things, that the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. This lawsuit remains pending, and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022. See Item 1 - Business-Regulated Businesses-Condemnation and Eminent Domain, which includes additional information regarding these matters.\nFurthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which our Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if the public utilitys infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits.\nContesting an exercise of condemnation, eminent domain or other similar process, or responding to a citizen petition, may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management. Moreover, our efforts to resist the condemnation, eminent domain or other process may not be successful, which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered. If a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our Regulated Businesses through eminent domain or other process, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business, that we will not be able to keep the compensation, or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges. Any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be subject to physical and cyber attacks.\nAs operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources. Our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks, acts of war or terrorism, vandalism or other causes. Our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access, due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism, and other causes. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack.\nIf, despite our security measures, a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred, our operations could be disrupted, property damaged, and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen; we could experience substantial loss of revenues, response costs and other financial loss; we could suffer a loss of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations; and we may be subject to increased regulation, litigation and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. Experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, about our customers and employees. In many cases, we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation, liability and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others.\nWe have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. The market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures. In the future, adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable, and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding consumer privacy and the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, which could result in, among other things, private or governmental claims or litigation against us, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, reputational harm and increased cost of operations.\nLaws and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly with respect to data and consumer privacy, security and protection. We are becoming subject to an increasing number of complex and continually evolving data and consumer privacy, security and protection laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local governments, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. Federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection, use and dissemination of data. Moreover, we expect that current laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States will continue to evolve and increase, and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws, regulations or standards will have on us or on our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with current or future federal, state, or local data or consumer privacy or security laws, regulations, policies, guidance, industry standards, or legal obligations, or any incident resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release, or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers, employees and others, may result in private or governmental enforcement actions, litigation or other claims against us, fines and penalties, or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and could result in us incurring substantial costs. These events could also require us to change our business practices, and the events or such changes may result in significant diversions of resources, distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities. Any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our Regulated Businesses, as well as the operations of our Market-Based Businesses. Our insurance programs have\nvarying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, workers compensation, employers liability, general liability, cybersecurity, terrorism risks and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are self-insured.\nAlthough in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business, there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.\nWe rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships, and a failure or disruption of implemented technology could materially and adversely affect our business.\nTechnology is an integral part of our business and operations, and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently, which, in turn, could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. We use technology systems to, among other things, bill customers, process orders, provide customer service, manage certain plant operations and construction projects, manage our financial records, track assets, remotely monitor our plants and facilities, and manage human resources, supply chain, inventory, and accounts receivable collections. As a specific example, we depend on water meters to record and communicate the amount of water our customers use, and in recent years, we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the Regulated Businesses. When these occur, we work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures. While these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations, there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water meters or other issues will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nAlthough we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations, our technology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things: failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems; loss or failure of power, internet, telecommunications or data network systems; and operator error or improper operation by, the negligent or improper supervision of, or the intentional acts of, employees, contractors and other third parties. Any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAn inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nA significant part of our long-term strategic focus on safety, operational excellence, O&M expense efficiency, water quality, asset and capital management and the customer experience includes implementing new technologies for, among other things: customer service and support; environmental compliance; water metering; water quality and source monitoring; cybersecurity; business development and growth; data analysis; employee development and training; and other initiatives. For example, we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing, deploying and maintaining customer-facing technologies, applications to support field service and customer service operations, water source sensor and evaluation technologies, data analytics and hyperautomation technologies and artificial intelligence technologies. Where appropriate, we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing, developing, deploying, integrating or maintaining these new technologies. Because these efforts can be long-term in nature, these new technologies may be more costly or time-consuming than expected to design, develop, integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion. While we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our Regulated Businesses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all, and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended O&M expense efficiencies or other key performance results and, ultimately, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems, or implement new systems, could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability.\nUpgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of managements time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including employees ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system. We continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, and have installed new, and upgraded existing, technology systems. Any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any\nadverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could harm our business (individually or collectively) and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDisruptions in our supply chain related to goods, such as pipe, chemicals, fuel, electricity, equipment, water and other raw materials, and services, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers, as well as our financial results.\nOur ability to serve our customers and operate our business in compliance with regulatory requirements is dependent upon purchasing or securing necessary goods and services from our suppliers and vendors. These items include but are not limited to contracted services, chemicals, pipe, valves, hydrants, fittings, fuel, equipment (including personal protective equipment), water and electricity. Examples of supply chain disruptions include reduced quantities of goods available in the marketplace, delays in manufacturing or shipping goods, labor shortages at our suppliers or vendors, natural disasters and operational impacts to some of our suppliers or vendors. Disruptions in our supply chain related to goods and services have occurred and we anticipate will continue to occur into the foreseeable future. Supply chain disruptions may cause us to be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain needed goods or services at a reasonable price or at all, and may significantly increase the price of goods and services we may obtain from suppliers and vendors. This, in turn, may adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers in compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as our associated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we attempt to plan for and have contingencies in place to address supply chain disruptions, our mitigation efforts may not be successful or may have further negative impacts on us.\nOur business has inherently dangerous work sites. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life, and be exposed to financial losses, including penalties and other liabilities.\nSafety is a core value and a strategy at American Water. Our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries are critical to our ability to carry out our operations effectively and to serve our customers, and thereby, to support our reputation. We maintain health and safety practices to protect our employees, customers, contractors, vendors and the public. Eliminating all hazards all of the time is extremely challenging, but through strict adherence to our health and safety practices, and empowering employees to be safety leaders who are expected to stop work if deemed unsafe, we believe we can achieve an injury-free workplace.\nAt our business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, our employees, contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanical operating equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, electric and gas utility lines, below grade trenches and vaults, electrical and pneumatic hazards, fall from height hazards, suspended loads, hazardous chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements. As an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are focused on the health and safety of our employees, contractors, vendors, customers and others who work at or visit our worksites. If the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, or we fail to implement procedures, our employees, contractors and others may experience illness, or minor, serious or fatal injuries. Unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover, expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our operations can involve the delivery, handling, storage, use and disposal of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly delivered, handled, stored, used or disposed of, could result in serious injury, death, environmental damage or property damage, and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to various environmental, transportation and occupational health and safety regulations. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective environmental health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization, including construction sites and operating facilities, the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 47% of our workforce was represented by unions, and we had 73 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees. These collective bargaining agreements, 21 of which will expire during 2022, are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation. We may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts, or enter into new agreements, on terms that are acceptable to us. Any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages. Labor actions, work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages, and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations, may disrupt our operations, negatively impact the ability to serve our customers, and result in higher labor costs, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWhile we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur, a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinancial, Economic and Market-Related Risks\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our aggregate long-term and short-term debt balance (including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements) was $11.0 billion, and our working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was in a deficit position. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;\nexposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;\nimpairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;\nrequiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;\nlimiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions; and\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.\nIn order to meet our capital expenditure needs, we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new short-term and long-term debt securities and/or equity. We continue to assess our short- and long-term liquidity needs in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial and capital markets, especially with respect to the market for corporate commercial paper, which experienced volatility and shortages of liquidity in March 2020. In response to these events, in March 2020, we entered into a $750 million 364-day term loan facility and immediately executed a $500 million draw thereunder to support our short-term liquidity by retaining that amount in cash. We repaid this term loan facility in full in March 2021. During 2021, we utilized other existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility as necessary or desirable to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. However, as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, the financial and capital markets and our operations continue to evolve, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.\nMoreover, additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness. Other than debt with respect to the term loan facility, debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2022, 2023 and 2024 will be $57 million, $280 million and $474 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms.\nWe have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements. See Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly mark to market valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by the financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely.\nOur inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to cash from operations, during 2021, we generally relied primarily on a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility, a $2.10 billion commercial paper program, our $750 million 364-day term loan facility (which expired and was repaid in full in March 2021) and the capital markets, to satisfy our liquidity needs. The revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in March 2025. Historically, we have regularly used our commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of short-term borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally could obtain in the commercial paper market. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, $584 million of commercial paper outstanding and $76 million in outstanding letters of credit. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility, when, as and if desired, or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable, or any, cost.\nUnder the terms of the revolving credit facility, our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70% of our consolidated capitalization, as determined under the terms of the facility. If our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit, lenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and payable. To avoid such a default, a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required, which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility. Our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including events beyond our control. For example, events that could cause a reduction in equity include, without limitation, a significant write-down of our goodwill. Even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants, the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete.\nDisruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all. While the lending banks that participate in the revolving credit facility have to date honored their commitments under those facilities, disruptions in the credit markets, changes in our credit ratings, or deterioration of the banking industrys financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments, extending the terms of such commitments, or agreeing to new commitments. In such a case, we may not be able to access the commercial paper or debt or capital markets, or other sources of potential liquidity, in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all. Furthermore, our inability to maintain, renew or replace commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Short- or long-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic, legislative, political or other uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in U.S. tax and other laws, reduced financing alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business. Any significant disruption in the capital, debt or credit markets, or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged. Such measures could include delaying or deferring capital expenditures, reducing or suspending dividend payments, and reducing other discretionary expenditures. Finally, there is no assurance that we will be able to access the equity markets to obtain capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us.\nAny of the foregoing events that impede our access to the debt or equity capital markets, or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions, could expose us to increased interest expense, require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nParent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds.\nParent company is a holding company and, as such, it has no substantive operations of its own. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Parent companys ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company. Prior to paying dividends to parent company, our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations, including, for example, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends, as well as applicable corporate, tax and other laws and regulations and agreements, and our covenants and other agreements. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company. A failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our state net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had state NOL carryforwards of approximately $123 million, and management believes it is more likely than not that these NOL carryforwards will be recovered in the future. Our state NOL carryforwards began to expire in 2021 and will continue to expire through 2041. We have, in the past, been unable to utilize certain of our state NOL carryforwards, and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income. Our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the state NOL carryforwards. If we are unable to fully utilize our state NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have recorded a significant amount of goodwill, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets, causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include $1.1 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2021. The goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As required by the applicable accounting rules, we have taken significant non-cash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past. We may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business. These market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price, a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities, market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies, decreases in control premiums, or other circumstances. A decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results, capital investment budgets or interest rates, could also result in an impairment charge. Recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred, which may negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and total capitalization. The effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings, secure financing on attractive terms, maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators.\nMarket volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities, as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans, which may require us to provide significant additional funding.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility, which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates. We are currently unable to predict the effect, if any, of the COVID-19 pandemic or other events on the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities. A decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and others. If interest rates are lower at the measurement date, our liabilities would increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in assumptions, such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements. Future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates, in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected. In addition, market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans. For example, a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements. To the extent that the discount rate used in our assumptions is reduced, our benefit obligations could be materially increased, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditional Risks Related to Market-Based Businesses\nParent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our Market-Based Businesses, including financial guarantees or deposits, which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced.\nUnder the terms of certain agreements under which our Market-Based Businesses, primarily MSG, provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and federal governmental entities, parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations, including financial guarantees or deposits. In the event these obligations are not performed, the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit. In that event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. At December 31, 2021, we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately $6.2 billion related to MSGs contracts, and this amount is likely to increase if the number of military bases served by MSG increases. The presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms.\nMSGs operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the U.S. government.\nMSG enters into contracts with the U.S. government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems, which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In addition, the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment, or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter. Annual economic price adjustment is an inflation index-based contract price increase mechanism. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. Any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, entering into contracts with the U.S. government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations. We are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations, which are complex, and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome. If we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation, we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the U.S. government or our existing contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNew accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. We could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nUndetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure.\nOur internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, taxation requirements, federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and relevant SEC rules, as well as other applicable regulations. Such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and Board of Directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. Management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, unanticipated or unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and non-compliant disclosure and reporting. The consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation, increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, licensed operators, water quality and other operating and craft personnel, and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, as key personnel approach retirement age, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe Companys properties consist primarily of (i) water and wastewater treatment plants, (ii) mains and pipes used for transmission, distribution and collection of water and wastewater, (iii) wells and other sources of water supply, such as reservoirs, (iv) water and wastewater pumping stations, (v) meters and fire hydrants, (vi) general structures, including buildings, dams and treated water storage facilities, (vii) land and easements, (viii) vehicles, (ix) software rights, and (x) other equipment and facilities, the majority of which are used directly in the operation of its systems. Substantially all of the Companys properties are owned by its subsidiaries, with a large percentage subject to liens of its mortgage bonds. A wholly owned subsidiary of parent company owns the Companys corporate headquarters, located in Camden, New Jersey, and the Company and its operating subsidiaries lease office space, equipment and furniture from certain of the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries. These properties are utilized by the Companys directors, officers and staff in the conduct of the business.\nThe properties of the Companys Regulated Businesses consist mainly of approximately:\n80 surface water treatment plants;\n480 groundwater treatment plants;\n160 wastewater treatment plants;\n52,500 miles of transmission, distribution and collection mains and pipes;\n1,100 groundwater wells;\n1,700 water and wastewater pumping stations;\n1,300 treated water storage facilities; and\n76 dams.\nThe Company has ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which its Regulated Businesses operate. These programs consist of both the rehabilitation of existing mains and equipment, and the replacement of mains and equipment that have been damaged or have reached, or are near, the end of their useful service lives. The properties of its Market-Based Businesses consist mainly of office furniture and IT equipment. Approximately 51% of all properties that the Company owns are located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nThe Company maintains property insurance against loss or damage to its properties by fire or other perils, subject to certain exceptions. For insured losses, the Company is self-insured to the extent that any losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained.\nThe Company believes that its properties are generally maintained in good operating condition and in accordance with current standards of good water and wastewater industry practice. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSet forth below is information related to the Companys material pending legal proceedings as of February 16, 2022, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, required to be disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information below should be read together with Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with the SECs disclosure rules, the Company has elected to disclose environmental proceedings involving the Company and a governmental authority if the amount of potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, that the Company reasonably believes will result from such proceeding is $1 million or more.\nAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions\nCompliance with SWRCB Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions\nUnder the 2009 Order, California-American Water Company, the Companys California subsidiary (Cal Am) is required, among other things, to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. See Item 1 - Business-Regulated Businesses-Water Supply and Wastewater Services and Item 1A - Risk Factors. The 2009 Order responded to claims that Cal Am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the Carmel River as required by a 1995 order of the SWRCB. In July 2016, at the request of Cal Am and several Monterey County government agencies, the SWRCB issued the 2016 Order approving the 2021 Deadline.\nThe 2009 Order includes a condition prohibiting Cal Am from diverting water from the Carmel River for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use. In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC) issued a decision directing modifications in Cal Ams tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the SWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to Cal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018, the MPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCBs written interpretation. In May 2018, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The SWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMDs resolution or the SWRCBs written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against Cal Am.\nCal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Beginning in January 2022, Cal Am expects to be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years will depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order in the future may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.\nMonterey Peninsula Water Supply Project\nCPUC Final Approval of Water Supply Project\nCal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred $50 million in associated costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.\nIn July 2019, Cal Am notified the MPWMD and Monterey One Water (collectively, the Agencies) that an event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement for the GWR Project because the Agencies failed to deliver to Cal Am by July 1, 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the GWR Project. In its notification to the Agencies, Cal Am expressly reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until the Performance Start Date, which was September 1, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, Cal Am determined that the Agencies met their performance obligations under the water purchase agreement with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract.\nIn September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUCs requirements for a CPCN and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUCs 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Ams cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Ams actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Ams prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, O&M costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by Cal Am after it becomes operational. Cal Am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid, minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the Water Supply Project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program, a reimbursement agreement for CPUC costs associated with that program, and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the Water Supply Project in service. Cal Am has incurred $186 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2021 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $47 million in AFUDC.\nIn September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Ams purchase of additional water from the expansion to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the GWR Project is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, and on November 29, 2021, Cal Am filed an application with the CPUC seeking review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am is also requesting rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totaling approximately $81 million. This amount is in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of recovery for facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement, which was approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.\nWhile Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUCs 2016 and 2018 final decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $50 million in construction costs previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision. See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nCoastal Development Permit Application\nIn June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the City) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the Citys coastal zone. Members of the Citys Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Ams coastal development permit application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the Coastal Commission, as permitted under the Citys code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction. In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its final decision approving the Water Supply Project. In November 2019, discussions between staffs of the Coastal Commission and the CPUC took place regarding the Coastal Commission staff recommendation, at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staffs findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and the viability of a project that the Coastal Commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.\nIn August 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit. Although the report concluded that the Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources, such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands, and that the Coastal Commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staffs report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern. In September 2020, Cal Am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staffs environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Ams appeal of the Citys denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. Cal Am refiled the original jurisdiction application in November 2020. In December 2020, the Coastal Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incomplete application, identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete.\nIn March 2021, Cal Am provided responses to the Coastal Commissions notice of incomplete application. On June 18, 2021, the Coastal Commission responded, acknowledging the responses and requesting certain additional information before the application could be considered complete. Cal Am responded with the requested additional information on January 11, 2022, and on February 8, 2022, the Coastal Commission requested additional information. The original jurisdiction application remains pending.\nDesalination Plant Development Permit\nThe proposed desalination plant for the Water Supply Project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of Monterey County, California on a site owned by CEMEX, Inc. (CEMEX), and requires a combined development permit from the County of Monterey prior to commencement of construction. On April 24, 2019, the Countys Planning Commission voted to approve the permit. In July 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard appeals filed by MCWD and a public advocacy group, at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit. In August 2019, MCWD filed a petition in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey Countys approval of Cal Ams combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin Monterey County and Cal Am from commencing construction of the desalination plant. In October 2019, after a hearing, the court denied, without prejudice, MCWDs motion for a preliminary injunction, but issued a stay of the Countys approval of the combined development permit, precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant, but allowing Cal Am to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plants construction. On January 21, 2021, the court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part MCWDs petition. The court found that the County of Monterey did not completely comply with all of the requirements necessary to approve the combined development permit and set aside its approval so that the County could come into compliance. The court denied all of MCWDs other claims. The court also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site.\nOn May 25, 2021, Cal Am filed a notice of appeal as to the Monterey County Superior Courts January 21, 2021 decision, seeking to challenge the courts decision on Monterey Countys statement of overriding considerations. Monterey County filed a notice of appeal as to the same issue on May 26, 2021. On June 22, 2021, MCWD filed cross-appeals on its claims that had been denied by the court.\nProposed Zoning Changes at CEMEX Site for Slant Wells\nIn August 2018, the City circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance, and placed the matter for consideration on the Planning Commissions agenda for its September 2018 meeting. The proposed amendments would change zoning at the CEMEX site to open space and restrict future uses, including with respect to Cal Ams planned use of the site for the slant wells for the Water Supply Project. Any change to the Citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the Coastal Commission. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments. At its November 2018 meeting, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution recommending that the Marina City Council consider approving the amendments.\nIn December 2018, the Marina City Council considered the proposed amendments. Cal Am, CEMEX and the Coastal Commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes, but the City Council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance. Changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final, which occurred at the Citys December 2018 meeting. The changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained.\nTest Slant Well Permitting\nA preliminary step to building the Water Supply Project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under Monterey Bay. In November 2014, the Coastal Commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until February 23, 2023. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as amended, will expire on December 16, 2022. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Ams coastal development permits.\nWater Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use\nIn July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or governmental entity. The consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves Cal Ams existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record. A permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am was recorded in June 2018 to allow Cal Am access to the property and to construct, operate and maintain the Water Supply Project intake wells. On November 26, 2019, the City notified CEMEX that, based on this permanent easement and Cal Ams proposed use of the site for the intake wells, CEMEX has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement (to which Cal Am was not a party). The City states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from CEMEX and Cal Am ordering that Cal Ams extraction is limited to 500 acre-feet per year of groundwater, that Cal Am cannot export extracted water out of the basin, and that the permanent easement granted by CEMEX to Cal Am is void. CEMEX has denied the Citys claims and requested indemnification from Cal Am under the terms of the permanent easement. Cal Am and CEMEX believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on Cal Ams right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by Cal Ams customers.\nIn May 2020, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court, naming Cal Am and CEMEX as defendants, and MCWRA and MCWD as real parties in interest. The lawsuit, as amended, alleges a claim for breach of contract against CEMEX and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by Cal Ams slant wells at the CEMEX site in excess of 500 acre-feet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin. In November 2020, Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA filed demurrers, which were overruled by the court at a hearing held on February 9, 2021.\nIn August 2020, MCWD filed a cross-complaint in the May 8, 2020 lawsuit against Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, alleging claims for specific performance of certain provisions of the 1996 annexation agreement related to the property owned by CEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, as well as claims of water rights, nuisance and unreasonable water use, and seeking additional declaratory relief. Following various rulings on demurrers filed by Cal Am, CEMEX and MCWRA, on February 23, 2021, the court sustained, without leave to amend, the demurrer to MCWDs nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers. On October 7, 2021, the court granted a motion filed by Cal Am related to MCWDs cross-complaint, which motion requested a referral of certain issues related to MCWDs water rights and unreasonable use claims to the SWRCB for its expert advisory opinion.\nChallenges Related to Compliance with Californias Sustainable Groundwater Management Act\nUnder Californias Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) enacted in 2015, groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency (GSA) by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan (GSP) designed to achieve sustainability by 2040. Under the SGMA, GSAs have broad powers to achieve sustainability including, but not limited to, regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating, limiting or suspending extractions from wells. The 400-acre CEMEX site overlies a small portion of the 180/400 Subbasin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin; the 84,000-acre 180/400 Subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted, mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin.\nIn late 2016, the Salinas Valley Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency (the SVBGSA) was formed as a joint powers authority to become the GSA for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin and prepare a GSP. In April 2018, the City filed a notice to become the GSA for the CEMEX site, creating an overlap with the SVBGSAs filing for the 180/400 Subbasin. In 2016, the SVBGSA commenced preparation of a GSP covering the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site, but in August 2019 the City filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own GSP for the CEMEX site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site. The State Department of Water Resources (SDWR) has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved, it will not accept the GSP from either agency, placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management. In December 2019, the County of Monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive GSA at the CEMEX site in order to resolve the overlap, which is permitted under SGMA. SDWR accepted Monterey Countys filing on December 18, 2019, and now lists Monterey County as the exclusive GSA for the site.\nOn December 30, 2019, the City filed a lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court challenging Monterey Countys filing, and SDWRs acceptance of the filing, as the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site. The City has named Monterey County and its Board of Supervisors, its GSA, and SDWR and its director as defendants, and the SVBGSA and its Board of Directors as real parties. The City seeks to invalidate Monterey Countys filing, as well as injunctive relief to preserve the Citys status as a GSA for the site. To protect its interest in the matter, Cal Am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit, which was granted. Monterey County filed cross-claims against the City and SDWR. After a hearing, on August 24, 2021, the court denied the claims brought by the City and granted Monterey Countys cross-claims, finding that the Citys GSA notice was untimely, the Monterey County GSA was the exclusive GSA for the CEMEX site, and the SVBGSAs GSP was properly adopted for the entire 180/400 subbasin, including the CEMEX site. On November 15, 2021, the City appealed this decision, and on December 13, 2021, Monterey County appealed the courts decision as to the finding that the Citys action creating a GSA was not void.\nOn September 14, 2020, Cal Am filed a separate but related complaint in Monterey County Superior Court challenging the validity of actions taken by the City and its GSA in adopting a groundwater sustainability plan for the CEMEX site, and the validity of the provisions of such plan. Due to the overlap of issues in the Citys lawsuit with those in the validation action, the parties stipulated to a stay of the validation action pending determination of the claims in the Citys action, which was approved by the court in December 2020.\nOn February 16, 2021, the City filed a separate but related in rem reverse validation complaint challenging the adoption by Monterey County of a GSP for the CEMEX site. This complaint remains pending. Currently, both validation actions remain stayed during the pendency of the Citys appeals.\nChallenge of Certification - Proposed Monterey System Acquisition Final Environmental Impact Report\nIn November 2018, voters in Monterey, California passed Measure J, which decided that the MPWMD should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of Cal Ams Monterey system assets, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. See Item 1 - Business-Regulated Businesses-Condemnation and Eminent Domain for more information on this matter. In August 2019, the MPWMDs General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board, among other things, (1) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of feasible as provided in Measure J, (2) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition, and (3) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.\nOn October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a FEIR for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets, and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the MPWMDs project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. On November 25, 2020, Cal Am filed a petition for writ of mandate in Monterey County Superior Court challenging certification of the FEIR, alleging that the MPWMDs analysis of environmental impacts was inadequate and that certification was improper. A hearing on the matter was held on August 30, 2021, and on November 19, 2021, the court denied Cal Ams petition.\nWest Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill\nSee Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies-Contingencies-West Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the final court approval of the global settlement with respect to the January 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill.\nDunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation\nOn the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by West Virginia-American Water Company, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary (WVAWC). The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored on July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.\nOn June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWCs facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.\nIn February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Courts order certifying the issues class. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 16, 2021, oral argument was heard by the Circuit Court on the issue of addressing the Supreme Court of Appeals remand. This matter remains pending.\nThe Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and WVAWC will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations.\nChattanooga, Tennessee Class Action Litigation\nOn September 12, 2019, Tennessee-American Water Company, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary (TAWC), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.\nOn September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and Service Company (collectively, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the Tennessee Plaintiffs). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. The court has entered an agreed scheduling order, which sets a hearing in October 2022 to address the question of class certification.\nTAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations.\nOther Matters\nOn April 2, 2021, American Water Resources, LLC (AWR), which, prior to the Closing Date was one of the indirect, wholly owned subsidiaries comprising the Companys former HOS operations, received a grand jury subpoena in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York (the EDNY). The subpoena seeks documents regarding AWRs operations and its contractor network in the New York City metropolitan area.\nIn connection with the sale of the HOS operations to the Buyer (including all of the Companys equity interests in AWR), the Company, AWR and the Buyer entered into a Common Interest and Cooperation Agreement (the Cooperation Agreement), dated as of the Closing Date, which facilitates a common defense for, and the sharing of information concerning, the EDNY investigation and any legal or regulatory inquiries or proceedings related to or resulting from it or the subject matter in the subpoena (collectively, the Covered Matters). The Company, on behalf of AWR, is required to defend any Covered Matter, using commercially reasonable efforts to resolve it on a reasonably expedient basis. Further, the Company is required to consult with the Buyer in specified circumstances and obtain its prior written consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before entering into any resolution of any Covered Matter that imposes non-monetary provisions or undertakings or any other terms for which there will be no indemnification under the Cooperation Agreement. In addition, for the period from the Closing Date to March 9, 2025, the Company is required to indemnify the Buyer for any monetary losses or out-of-pocket damages (as described in the Cooperation Agreement) incurred by the Buyer or certain of the HOS subsidiaries to the extent directly arising in connection with, or directly resulting from, any Covered Matter.\nBased on the subpoena and discussions with the EDNY, the investigation does not appear to be focused on the Company, and the Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. While it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of the investigation or determine the amount, if any, of fines, penalties or other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with it, the Company does not currently believe that the investigation will have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nGeneral\nPeriodically, the Company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Other than those proceedings described in this Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, the Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial position or results of operations. However, litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. It is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to the Company, and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nSince April 23, 2008, the Companys common stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol AWK. As of February 10, 2022, there were 181,724,991 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 2,333 record holders. Holders of the Companys common stock are entitled to receive dividends when they are declared by its Board of Directors. See Note 10-Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Companys dividends.\nIn February 2015, the Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of shares issued through the Companys dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities. The program allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The program is conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act, and, to facilitate these repurchases, the Company enters into Rule 10b5-1 stock repurchase plans with a third-party broker, which allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Subject to applicable regulations, the Company may elect to amend or cancel the program or the stock repurchase parameters at its discretion to manage dilution.\nFrom April 1, 2015, the date repurchases under the anti-dilutive stock repurchase program commenced, through December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 4,860,000 shares of its common stock under the program, leaving an aggregate of 5,140,000 shares available for repurchase under this program. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2021.  ITEM 7.

The Company has a disclosure committee consisting of members of senior management and other key employees involved in the preparation of the Companys SEC reports. The disclosure committee is actively involved in the review and discussion of the Companys SEC filings. For a discussion and analysis of the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, please refer to Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nOverview\nAmerican Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. The Company employs approximately 6,400 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states. The Companys primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers, collectively presented as the Regulated Businesses. The Companys utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states in the United States, with 3.4 million active customers with services provided by its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Companys utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs. The Company also operates other market-based businesses that provide water, wastewater and other services to residential and smaller commercial customers, the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities and utility customers, collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses. These Market-Based Businesses are not subject to economic regulation by state PUCs. See Item 1 - Business for additional information.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nAmerican Water continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken steps since the beginning of the pandemic to mitigate adverse impacts to the Company. The Company has three main areas of focus as part of its response to COVID-19: the care and safety of its employees; the safety of its customers and the communities it serves; and the execution of its business continuity plan. American Water continues to work with its vendors to prevent disruptions in its supply chain, and, at this time, has not experienced, and does not anticipate, any material disruptions. The Company also continues to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the capital markets, including impacts that could increase its cost of capital.\nThe Company has experienced financial impacts since the beginning of the pandemic resulting from lower revenues from the suspension of late fees and foregone reconnect fees in certain states, certain incremental O&M expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and additional debt costs. These impacts are collectively referred to as financial impacts. See Note 3-Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may further impact American Water, including without limitation, its liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, will depend on future developments, which presently cannot be predicted.\nAs of February 16, 2022, American Water has commission orders authorizing deferred accounting or cost recovery for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of 13 jurisdictions. Other regulatory actions to date are presented in the table below:\nCommission Actions Description States\nOrders issued with deferred accounting Allows the Company to establish regulatory assets to record certain financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. HI, IN, MD, NJ, PA, VA, WV\nOrders issued with cost recovery Californias Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account allows the Companys California subsidiary to track certain financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic for future recovery requests. Iowa issued a base rate case order on June 28, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred within its annual non-recurring expense rider. Illinois has authorized cost recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts through a special purpose rider over a 24-month period, which was implemented effective October 1, 2020. Additionally, Illinois approved a bad debt rider tariff on December 16, 2020, allowing collection of actual bad debt expense over last authorized beginning April 2021 through February 2023. Illinois approved a stipulation in March 2021 to allow the rider to be extended through the end of 2023. Missouri issued a base rate case order on April 7, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred through March 31, 2021 over a three-year period.\nCA, IA, IL, MO\nThe Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed for a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the PaPUC) to defer as a regulatory asset all identified COVID-19 financial impacts. On September 15, 2021, the PaPUC issued an order approving the Companys request to defer, with carrying costs, incremental uncollectible expense and other incremental costs net of savings attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PaPUC order denied the request to include lost revenues attributed to the waiver of late fees and reconnect fees and expenses associated with additional interest costs. Additionally, the PaPUC order approved the request to allow for the continuation of the deferral of financial impacts, rejecting proposals from the intervening parties to define an end date to the deferral in 2021. As a result of the order discussed above, the Company recorded a net $7 million reduction to its regulatory assets and corresponding impacts to revenue, interest expense and uncollectible expense during the third quarter of 2021. The Company continues to evaluate options within its next base rate case to address these denied items and the resulting financial impact.\nOn July 28, 2021, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary filed a stipulation and settlement agreement with the Consumer Advocate Unit in the Financial Division of the Office of the Tennessee Attorney General, which reflected agreement on the deferral of COVID-19-related financial impacts through April 30, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission denied the stipulation and settlement agreement and moved to address the Companys Tennessee subsidiarys petition to defer the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future hearing. On August 26, 2021, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary filed a motion to withdraw its pending petition, preserving its right to seek recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future proceeding.\nIn December 2020, the Kentucky Public Service Commission issued an order denying a request to defer to a regulatory asset the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsistent with these regulatory orders, the Company has recorded $36 million in regulatory assets and $6 million of regulatory liabilities for the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of February 16, 2022, one state, New Jersey, continues moratoria until March 15, 2022, on the suspension of service disconnections due to non-payment. The moratoria on disconnects have expired in 12 states. The Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to comply with the current ordered moratoria and any future moratoria implemented.\nIn 2019, the Company completed and submitted its project completion certification to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) in connection with its capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA determined that the Company is qualified to receive $164 million in tax credits over a ten-year period. The Company is required to meet various annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15. The Company has made the necessary annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and expects to make the 2021 filing by April 30, 2022. As a result, the Company had receivables of $49 million and $115 million in other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. The submitted filings are under review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in the first half of 2022.\nIn March 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the NJEDA, pursuant to Executive Order 103 - State of Emergency and a Public Health Emergency, temporarily waived the requirement that a full-time employee must spend at least 80% of his or her time at the qualified business facility (QBF) to meet the definition of eligible position or full-time job. The waiver will continue for as long as New Jerseys Executive Order 281 is valid. On July 2, 2021, New Jerseys Governor approved a bill that revised provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 2020 and other economic development programs, including amending the definition of an eligible position and full-time job in the Grow New Jersey Program and replacing the 80% requirement of time spent at the QBF. The bill states that an eligible position is one that is filled by a full-time employee who has their primary office at the QBF and spends at least 60% of their time at the QBF. The bill specifically states that it supersedes the existing regulations and existing incentive agreements that require an eligible employee spend at least 80% of their time at the QBF.\nSale of Homeowner Services Group\nOn the Closing Date, the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to the Buyer for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $748 million. The consideration is comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. The structure of the transaction enables the initial cash proceeds to be redeployed into the Regulated Businesses to fund near-term incremental capital investments, while interest on the seller note provides a stream of earnings during its term. Upon maturity, the proceeds from the repayment of the seller note are expected to be used to fund capital investment in the Regulated Businesses. This sale narrowed the focus of the Companys Market-Based Businesses primarily to MSG.\nThe seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note have been secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants.\nBeginning December 9, 2024, the Company has a put right pursuant to which it may require the seller note to be repaid in full at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, except that upon the occurrence of a disruption event in the broadly syndicated term loan B debt financing market, repayment by the Buyer pursuant to the Companys exercise of the put right will be delayed until the market disruption event ends.\nThe seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyers election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the seller note in breach of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from 105.5% to 107.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the loan and a customary make-whole payment.\nThe Company and the Buyer also entered into a revenue share agreement, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated from customers who are billed for home warranty services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an on-bill arrangement), and 15% of the revenue generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unless earlier terminated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods.\nFinancing Activities\nOn May 10, 2021, American Water Capital Corp. (AWCC) completed a $1.1 billion debt offering, which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.30% senior notes due 2031 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% senior notes due 2051. Net proceeds of this offering were used to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries, to prepay $327 million in aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding senior notes, to repay AWCCs commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes. See Note 12-Long-Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nAs a result of AWCCs prepayment of the various senior notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Companys utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.\nSelected Financial Data\nThis selected financial data below should be read in conjunction with the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as the remainder of this Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions, except per share data) 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017\nStatement of Operations data:\nOperating revenues $ 3,930 $ 3,777 $ 3,610 $ 3,440 $ 3,357\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 1,263 709 621 567 426\nNet income attributable to common shareholders per basic common share $ 6.96 $ 3.91 $ 3.44 $ 3.16 $ 2.39\nNet income attributable to common shareholders per diluted common share 6.95 3.91 3.43 3.15 2.38\nBalance Sheet data:\nTotal assets $ 26,075 $ 24,766 $ 22,682 $ 21,223 $ 19,482\nLong-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 10,344 9,333 8,644 7,576 6,498\nOther data:\nCash dividends declared per common share $ 2.41 $ 2.20 $ 2.00 $ 1.82 $ 1.66\nNet cash provided by operating activities 1,441 1,426 1,383 1,386 1,449\nNet cash used in investing activities (1,536) (2,061) (1,945) (2,036) (1,672)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (345) 1,120 494 726 207\nCapital expenditures included in net cash used in investing activities (1,764) (1,822) (1,654) (1,586) (1,434)\nFinancial Results\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, diluted earnings per share (GAAP) were $6.95, $3.91 and $3.43, respectively. In 2021, as compared to 2020, diluted earnings per share increased $3.04. This increase was primarily driven by a pre-tax gain on sale of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS and continued growth in the Regulated Businesses from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth. These increases were offset by the $45 million pre-tax contribution to the AWCF authorized by the Company in 2021, and the impacts from weather in both 2021 and 2020, which had an estimated net decrease of $13 million in revenues in 2021, or $0.05 per share. The consolidated net income impact of the gain on sale of HOS and the AWCF contribution is $491 million, or $2.70 per share, inclusive of a $13 million net income benefit included in the Other segment, from the revaluation of state net operating losses that can now be utilized as a result of the sale.\nGrowth Through Capital Investment in Infrastructure and Regulated Acquisitions\nThe Company expects to continue to grow its businesses, with the majority of its growth to be achieved in the Regulated Businesses through (i) continued capital investment in the Companys infrastructure to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services to its customers, and (ii) regulated acquisitions to expand the Companys services to new customers. In 2021, the Company invested $1.9 billion, primarily in the Regulated Businesses, as discussed below:\nRegulated Businesses Growth and Optimization\n$1.8 billion capital investment in the Regulated Businesses, the majority for infrastructure improvements and replacements; and\n$135 million to fund acquisitions, including deposits discussed below, in the Regulated Businesses, which added approximately 20,000 water and wastewater customers during 2021, in addition to approximately 17,500 customers added through organic growth during 2021.\nOn April 6, 2021, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the York City Sewer Authority for $235 million, plus an amount of average daily revenue calculated for the period between the final meter reading and the date of closing. This system, directly and indirectly through bulk contracts, serves more than 45,000 customers. In connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary paid a $20 million deposit to the seller on April 30, 2021, which is refundable in the event the agreement is terminated prior to closing of the acquisition. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the first half of 2022, pending regulatory approval.\nOn March 29, 2021, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City for $22 million. The water and wastewater systems currently serve approximately 1,500 customers each, or 3,000 combined, and are being sold through the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act process. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the second half of 2022, pending regulatory approval.\nDuring 2022, the Company closed on the acquisition of two regulated water and wastewater systems adding approximately 700 customers, for a total aggregate purchase price of $2 million. As of February 16, 2022, the Company has entered into agreements for pending acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses, including the York City Sewer Authority and Egg Harbor City agreements discussed above, to add approximately 77,000 additional customers.\nSale of New York American Water Company, Inc.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Companys New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Companys regulated New York operations represented approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. The assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSale of Michigan American Water Company\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for approximately $6 million.\nFuture Growth\nThe Company expects to invest between $13 billion to $14 billion over the next five years, and between $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years, including $2.5 billion in 2022. The Companys expected future investments include:\ncapital investment for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses between $11.5 billion to $12 billion over the next five years, and between $25 billion to $28 billion over the next 10 years, including $2 billion expected in 2022; and\ngrowth from acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses to expand the Companys water and wastewater customer base of between $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the next five years, and between $3 billion to $4 billion over the next 10 years, including $500 million expected in 2022.\nPresented in the following chart is the estimated allocation of the Companys expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in its Regulated Businesses over the next five years, by purpose:\nOperational Excellence\nThe Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio, which is used as a measure of the operating performance of the Regulated Businesses, was 34.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 34.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement in this ratio reflects the continued focus on operating costs, as well as an increase in operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses after considering the adjustment for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (EADIT) shown in the table below.\nThe Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure and is defined by the Company as its operation and maintenance expenses from the Regulated Businesses, divided by the operating revenues from the Regulated Businesses, where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense. Operating revenues were further adjusted to exclude reductions for the amortization of the EADIT. Also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses is the allocable portion of non-O&M support services costs, mainly depreciation and general taxes, which is reflected in the Regulated Businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses, but for consolidated financial reporting purposes, is categorized within other line items in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, the Company excluded the impact of certain Freedom Industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2019 from operation and maintenance expenses. The items discussed above were excluded from the O&M efficiency ratio calculation as they are not reflective of managements ability to increase the efficiency of the Regulated Businesses.\nThe Company evaluates its operating performance using this ratio, and believes it is useful to investors because it directly measures improvement in the operating performance and efficiency of the Regulated Businesses. This information is derived from the Companys consolidated financial information but is not presented in its financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Companys GAAP disclosures, and should be considered as an addition to, and not a substitute for, any GAAP measure. The Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio (i) is not an accounting measure that is based on GAAP; (ii) is not based on a standard, objective industry definition or method of calculation; (iii) may not be comparable to other companies operating measures; and (iv) should not be used in place of the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPresented in the table below is the calculation of the Companys adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues, each as determined in accordance with GAAP, to those amounts utilized in the calculation of its adjusted O&M efficiency ratio:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019\nTotal operation and maintenance expenses $ 1,777 $ 1,622 $ 1,544\nLess:\nOperation and maintenance expenses-Market-Based Businesses 482 389 393\nOperation and maintenance expenses-Other (30) (25) (31)\nTotal operation and maintenance expenses-Regulated Businesses 1,325 1,258 1,182\nLess:\nRegulated purchased water expenses 153 149 135\nAllocation of non-operation and maintenance expenses 34 41 31\nImpact of Freedom Industries settlement activities (a)\n- - (4)\nAdjusted operation and maintenance expenses-Regulated Businesses (i)\n$ 1,138 $ 1,068 $ 1,020\nTotal operating revenues $ 3,930 $ 3,777 $ 3,610\nLess:\nOperating revenues-Market-Based Businesses 563 540 539\nOperating revenues-Other (17) (18) (23)\nTotal operating revenues-Regulated Businesses 3,384 3,255 3,094\nLess:\nRegulated purchased water revenues (b)\n153 149 135\nRevenue reductions from the amortization of EADIT (104) (7) -\nAdjusted operating revenues-Regulated Businesses (ii)\n$ 3,335 $ 3,113 $ 2,959\nAdjusted O&M efficiency ratio-Regulated Businesses (i) / (ii)\n34.1 % 34.3 % 34.5 %\n(a) Includes the impact of a reduction of a liability in the first quarter of 2019 related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.\n(b) The calculation assumes regulated purchased water revenues approximate regulated purchased water expenses.\nRegulatory Matters\nGeneral Rate Cases\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, excluding reductions for the amortization of EADIT that are generally offset in income tax expense, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from general rate cases authorizations that became effective during 2019 through 2021:\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nGeneral rate cases by state (a):\nIowa (effective October 11, 2021)\n$ 1 $ - $ -\nMissouri (effective May 28, 2021)\n22 - -\nPennsylvania (effective January 28, 2021)\n70 - -\nCalifornia (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and May 11, 2019)\n22 5 4\nNew Jersey (effective November 1, 2020)\n- 54 -\nIndiana (effective May 1, 2020 and July 1, 2019)\n- 13 4\nKentucky (effective June 28, 2019)\n- - 13\nWest Virginia (effective February 25, 2019)\n- - 19\nMaryland (effective February 5, 2019)\n- - 1\nTotal general rate case authorizations $ 115 $ 72 $ 41\n(a)Excludes authorized increases of $7 million and $4 million in 2021 and 2019, respectively, for the Companys New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOn November 18, 2021, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision in the test year 2021 general rate case filed by the Companys California subsidiary, which is retroactive to January 1, 2021. The Companys California subsidiary received authorization for additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $22 million, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA). The EADIT reduction in revenues is $4 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. On January 18, 2022, the Companys California subsidiary filed for approval of $13 million in 2022 escalation increases, excluding $4 million of reductions related to the TCJA. This filing, which is retroactive to January 1, 2022, is subject to CPUC approval with a 45-day review period.\nOn June 28, 2021, an order was issued authorizing an increase of $1 million in the general rate case filed by the Companys Iowa subsidiary in 2020. The Companys Iowa subsidiary filed tariffs consistent with the order on September 23, 2021. Effective October 11, 2021, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the tariffs and implemented the new rates.\nOn April 7, 2021, the Companys Missouri subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $22 million, effective May 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the TCJA. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $25 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. The protected EADIT balance of $72 million is being returned to customers using the average rate assumption method (ARAM), and the unprotected EADIT balance of $74 million is being returned to customers over 10 years. The $25 million EADIT reduction includes both the protected and unprotected catch-up period EADIT of $13 million. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax rate went into effect until new base rates went into effect and will be amortized over 2.5 years.\nOn March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the NJBPU) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Companys New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfields water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJs initial decision without modification. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. A scheduling order was issued on October 18, 2021 establishing a briefing schedule through March 2022. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPUs order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn February 25, 2021, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million, effective January 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the TCJA, over two steps. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $19 million. The overall increase, net of TCJA reductions, is $71 million in revenues combined over two steps. The first step was effective January 28, 2021 in the amount of $70 million ($51 million including TCJA reductions) and the second step will be effective January 1, 2022 in the amount of $20 million. The protected EADIT balance of $200 million is being returned to customers using the ARAM, and the unprotected EADIT balance of $116 million is being returned to customers over 20 years. The $19 million annually includes both the protected and unprotected EADIT amortizations and a portion of catch-up period EADIT. A bill credit of $11 million annually for two years returns to customers the remainder of the EADIT catch-up period amortization. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax rate went into effect until new base rates went into effect and will be amortized over two years.\nPending General Rate Case Filings\nOn February 10, 2022, the Companys Illinois subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $71 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $110 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Companys Kentucky subsidiary filed a wastewater rate case requesting additional revenues of $1 million, excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA. The Company requested a four-step rate increase for their wastewater operations with effective dates of June 1, 2022, June 1, 2023, June 1, 2024 and June 1, 2025 for annual amounts of less than $1 million each year. The Company filed their wastewater case under the alternative rate filing process for smaller utilities which calculates an operating ratio of 88% rather than a return on equity.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Companys Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $15 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA.\nOn August 18, 2021, the Companys Hawaii subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $2 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $32 million in annualized incremental revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges. The proposed EADIT reduction in revenues is $1 million and the exclusion for infrastructure surcharges is $10 million. Intervenor testimony was received on September 20, 2021. The Companys rebuttal testimony was filed on October 5, 2021. Hearings were conducted on November 3 and 4, 2021. A final order is expected no later than February 24, 2022.\nThe Companys California subsidiary submitted its application on May 3, 2021 to set its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. According to the CPUCs process, a decision is expected to be issued, setting the authorized cost of capital in the third quarter of 2022.\nInfrastructure Surcharges\nA number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2019 through 2021:\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nInfrastructure surcharges by state (a):\nNew Jersey (b)\n$ 26 $ 20 $ 15\nMissouri (c)\n7 12 14\nKentucky (effective July 1, 2021 and July 1, 2020)\n1 1 -\nIndiana (effective March 17, 2021)\n8 - -\nPennsylvania (d)\n8 27 11\nIllinois (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2019)\n7 7 8\nWest Virginia (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2019)\n5 3 2\nTennessee (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and September 1, 2019)\n3 2 1\nTotal infrastructure surcharge authorizations $ 65 $ 72 $ 51\n(a)Excludes authorized increases of $2 million in 2019 for the Companys New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(b)In 2021, $12 million was effective on December 30 and $14 million was effective June 28. In 2020, $10 million was effective June 29 and $10 million was effective January 1. In 2019, the effective date was July 1.\n(c)In 2021, the effective date was October 7. In 2020, $2 million was effective December 14 and $10 million was effective June 27. In 2019, $5 million was effective December 21 and $9 million was effective June 24.\n(d)In 2021, the effective date was January 1. In 2020, $8 million was effective October 1, $4 million was effective July 1, $5 million was effective April 1 and $10 million was effective January 1. In 2019, $6 million was effective October 1, $3 million was effective July 1 and $2 million was effective April 1.\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective after January 1, 2022:\n(In millions) Amount\nInfrastructure surcharge filings by state:\nIllinois (effective January 1, 2022) $ 6\nMissouri (effective February 1, 2022) 12\nTotal infrastructure surcharge filings $ 18\nPending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings\nOn January 19, 2022, the Companys Indiana subsidiary filed for infrastructure surcharges requesting $8 million in additional annualized revenues.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge requesting $3 million in additional annualized revenues.\nTax Matters\nFederal Tax Legislation\nOn November 15, 2021, the IIJA was signed into law and was designed to provide significant investment in the nations infrastructure. The Company has analyzed the bill to assess legislative tax impacts, and determined that the most significant aspect impacting the Company is the provision for special rules for regulated water and wastewater utilities as it relates to the tax treatment of contributions in aid of construction (CIAC). The bill reinstates the pre-TCJA tax treatment of CIAC, which allows regulated water and wastewater utilities to generally exclude the receipt of CIAC from taxable income. This provision is effective for contributions made after December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has reflected the exemption retroactively to January 1, 2021.\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Companys deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as EADIT will be used to benefit the Companys regulated customers in future rates. Twelve of the Companys regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and crediting customers. The Company expects the timing of the amortization of EADIT credits for the one remaining regulated subsidiary to be addressed in a pending rate case or other proceedings. When crediting EADIT to the customer, the Company records both a reduction to revenue and a reduction to income tax expense, having no material impact on net income.\nFederal Net Operating Loss\nThe Company had no federal NOL carryover balance remaining as of December 31, 2021 due to the HOS sale, after which time the Company became a cash taxpayer for federal income tax purposes.\nLegislative Updates\nDuring 2021, the Companys regulatory jurisdictions enacted the following legislation that has been approved and is effective as of February 16, 2022:\nCalifornia passed electronic payment legislation, Assembly Bill 1058, which permanently changes state law to allow investor-owned water and wastewater utilities to accept electronic payments, including credit and debit cards, without charging processing fees to customers.\nCalifornia passed CPUC consolidation timeline legislation, Assembly Bill 1250, which requires the CPUC to make timely decisions on applications to acquire systems. Consolidations of $5 million or less are to be processed within 180 days and those more than $5 million are required to be processed within 12 months.\nThe Kentucky General Assembly adopted House Bill 465 relating to the acquisition of water and wastewater utilities. The legislation affirms a method in valuing water and wastewater systems above net book value and establishes a timeline of 60 days for Public Service Commission approval of an acquisition.\nIndiana House Enrolled Act 1287 creates a mechanism that reduces the required upfront cost to new customers for a water or wastewater utility to extend service to underserved areas.\nIndiana House Enrolled Act 349 establishes a tax rider for water and wastewater utilities based upon a change in state or federal income tax law. The legislation also requires the Indiana Finance Authority to prioritize loans that secure long-term benefits over shorter term projects.\nNew Jersey passed Lead Service Line Replacement Bill, Senate Bill 3398/Assembly Bill 5343, which provides for the replacement of lead service lines within 10 years of the effective date of the bill and authorizes cost recovery of customer-owned lead service lines as an O&M expense plus interest through a semi-annual surcharge.\nMissouri passed the Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act, Senate Bill 44/House Bill 397, to establish a new statewide surcharge mechanism program which covers replacement of aging water distribution and sewer collection infrastructure. This legislation broadens the eligible projects covered by the current Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharge mechanism and expands its applicability to projects across the state.\nNew Jersey passed Senate Bill 647/House Bill 4825 which strengthens the WQAA by requiring the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt regulations to implement the WQAA, enhancing asset management plans and reporting, upgrading cyber security standards and adding criminal penalties for falsifying reports.\nIllinois passed House Bill 414, Low Income Water & Sewer Financial Assistance Program, which authorizes the states Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to institute a water and sewer assistance program for customers of privately and publicly owned systems. The program is modeled off the existing energy supplemental state Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\nIn September 2020, the CPUC released a decision under its Low-Income Rate Payer Assistance program rulemaking that will require the Companys California subsidiary to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which would become effective in January 2024. On October 5, 2020, the Companys California subsidiary filed an application for rehearing of the decision and following the CPUCs denial of its rehearing application in September 2021, the Companys California subsidiary filed a petition for writ of review with the California Supreme Court on October 27, 2021.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nPresented in the table below are the Companys consolidated results of operations:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nOperating revenues $ 3,930 $ 3,777 $ 3,610\nOperating expenses:\nOperation and maintenance 1,777 1,622 1,544\nDepreciation and amortization 636 604 582\nGeneral taxes 321 303 280\nOther - - (10)\nTotal operating expenses, net 2,734 2,529 2,396\nOperating income 1,196 1,248 1,214\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (403) (397) (386)\nInterest income 4 2 4\nNon-operating benefit costs, net 78 49 16\nGain or (loss) on sale of businesses 747 - (44)\nOther, net 18 22 29\nTotal other income (expense) 444 (324) (381)\nIncome before income taxes 1,640 924 833\nProvision for income taxes 377 215 212\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,263 $ 709 $ 621\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Companys operating segments are comprised of the revenue-generating components of its business for which separate financial information is internally produced and regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its business primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates other businesses that, individually, do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses, which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses. For a discussion and analysis of the Companys financial statements for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, please refer to Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2021.\nRegulated Businesses Segment\nPresented in the table below is financial information for the Regulated Businesses:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nOperating revenues $ 3,384 $ 3,255 $ 3,094\nOperation and maintenance 1,325 1,258 1,182\nDepreciation and amortization 601 562 529\nGeneral taxes 301 285 262\nOther operating expenses 1 (3) (10)\nOther income (expenses) (195) (221) (262)\nIncome before income taxes 962 932 869\nProvision for income taxes 172 217 215\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 789 715 654\nOperating Revenues\nPresented in the tables below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses operating revenues:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nWater services:\nResidential $ 1,935 $ 1,895 $ 1,735\nCommercial 676 627 639\nFire service 151 147 142\nIndustrial 141 133 138\nPublic and other 239 226 230\nTotal water services 3,142 3,028 2,884\nWastewater services:\nResidential 151 134 119\nCommercial 37 34 31\nIndustrial 4 3 3\nPublic and other 16 14 14\nTotal wastewater services 208 185 167\nOther (a)\n34 42 43\nTotal operating revenues $ 3,384 $ 3,255 $ 3,094\n(a)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(Gallons in millions)\nBilled water services volumes:\nResidential 173,644 178,753 167,470\nCommercial 77,476 75,875 81,268\nIndustrial 35,738 34,875 37,242\nFire service, public and other 51,957 49,031 50,501\nTotal billed water services volumes 338,815 338,534 336,481\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, operating revenues increased $129 million primarily due to $208 million increase from authorized rate increases, including infrastructure surcharges, principally to fund infrastructure investment in various states, and a $26 million increase from water and wastewater acquisitions, as well as organic growth in existing systems. These increases were offset by an estimated net decrease of $13 million from weather in both 2021 and 2020, a $5 million decrease from lower water services demand and ongoing customer usage reductions from conservation, and a $79 million decrease in revenues due to the amortization of EADIT, which is generally offset with a reduction in income tax expense. Additionally, there was an $8 million decrease in revenue due to the denial of authorization to defer certain COVID-19 financial impacts based on the PaPUC order received by the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary. See Note 3-Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOperation and Maintenance\nPresented in the table below is information regarding the main components of the Regulated Businesses operating and maintenance expense:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nEmployee-related costs $ 522 $ 495 $ 462\nProduction costs 353 335 317\nOperating supplies and services 245 242 237\nMaintenance materials and supplies 93 84 74\nCustomer billing and accounting 66 58 55\nOther 46 44 37\nTotal $ 1,325 $ 1,258 $ 1,182\nEmployee-Related Costs\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nSalaries and wages $ 402 $ 382 $ 363\nGroup insurance 66 65 60\nPensions 25 20 12\nOther benefits 29 28 27\nTotal $ 522 $ 495 $ 462\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, employee-related costs increased $27 million primarily due to a $20 million increase in salaries and wages from higher headcount and related compensation expense supporting growth in the businesses and a $5 million increase in pension service costs.\nProduction Costs\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nPurchased water $ 153 $ 149 $ 135\nFuel and power 97 88 90\nChemicals 59 57 54\nWaste disposal 44 41 38\nTotal $ 353 $ 335 $ 317\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, production costs increased $18 million primarily due to a $9 million increase in fuel and power due to higher rates and system delivery across several subsidiaries and a $4 million increase in purchased water primarily due to usage in the Companys California subsidiary.\nMaintenance Materials and Supplies\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, maintenance materials and supplies increased $9 million primarily due to timing of maintenance and tank painting projects in the Companys New Jersey subsidiary and increased paving costs from a higher volume of main breaks.\nCustomer Billing and Accounting\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, customer billing and accounting increased $8 million primarily due to higher call volumes experienced at our customer service centers, higher collections costs and higher uncollectible costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, depreciation and amortization increased $39 million primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments and acquisitions.\nGeneral Taxes\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, general taxes increased $16 million, primarily due to increased capital investments, including acquisitions, increased tax rates across several subsidiaries and an increase in the New Jersey Gross Receipts Tax.\nOther Income (Expenses)\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, other income (expenses) increased $26 million primarily due to the reduction in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense resulting from higher asset returns.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, the Regulated Businesses provision for income taxes decreased $45 million. The Regulated Businesses effective income tax rate was 17.9% and 23.3% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of EADIT resulting from the TCJA, pursuant to regulatory orders. The amortization of EADIT is generally offset with reductions in revenue.\nMarket-Based Businesses\nPresented in the table below is information for the Market-Based Businesses:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nOperating revenues $ 563 $ 540 $ 539\nOperation and maintenance 482 389 393\nDepreciation and amortization 22 26 37\nGain or (loss) on sale of businesses 748 (1) (44)\nIncome before income taxes 798 120 66\nProvision for income taxes 248 29 20\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 550 91 46\nOperating Revenues\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, operating revenues increased $23 million primarily due to a $32 million increase in capital and O&M projects in the MSG, across several of the Companys military bases, primarily at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, Fort Belvoir and Joint Base Lewis-McChord and a $7 million increase in the CSG related to the contract with the City of Camden, New Jersey. These increases were partially offset by a $17 million year over year decrease at HOS due to the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOperation and Maintenance\nPresented in the table below is information regarding the main components of the Market-Based Businesses operating and maintenance expense:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nOperating supplies and services $ 221 $ 148 $ 128\nMaintenance materials and supplies 123 114 109\nEmployee-related costs 96 90 109\nProduction costs 22 21 29\nOther 20 16 18\nTotal $ 482 $ 389 $ 393\nOperating Supplies and Services\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, operating supplies and services increased $73 million primarily due to the $45 million pre-tax contribution to the AWCF authorized by the Company in 2021, costs associated with MSG from increased capital and O&M projects as discussed above and an increase in additional O&M costs related to CSG.\nMaintenance Materials and Supplies\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, maintenance materials and supplies increased $9 million primarily due to an increase in CSG related to the contract with the City of Camden, New Jersey and an increase in HOS due to contract growth and an increase in claims. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in HOS due to the sale of its business in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nEmployee-Related Costs\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, employee-related costs increased $6 million primarily due to an increase in salaries and wages in MSG from the addition of new bases in the second half of 2020 and HOS for additional customer service costs to support the business.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, depreciation and amortization decreased $4 million primarily due to lower intangible asset amortization expenses in HOS.\nGain or (Loss) on Sale of Businesses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $748 million relating to the sale of HOS. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn 2021, as compared to 2020, provision for income taxes increased $219 million primarily due to the sale of HOS. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities, (iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) to pay federal income taxes, which the Company began to pay as a result of fully utilizing its NOL carryforward in 2021. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment. Additionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1 - Business-Regulated Businesses-Regulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external debt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of long-term debt and equity in addition to the proceeds from the sales of HOS and the Companys New York subsidiary. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\nThe Company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments, acquisitions, operations, commitments, debt maturities, interest and dividends. The Companys business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, the Company also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. The Company may also access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Companys access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Companys ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets.\nIf these unfavorable business, market, financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the Company is no longer able to access the commercial paper and/or capital markets on reasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The facility is used principally to fulfill the Companys short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCCs $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billion available to fulfill its short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit.\nTo ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Facility). The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and American Water and to provide additional liquidity. The Term Loan Facility commitments terminated at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the Term Loan Facility was repaid in full.\nThe Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Companys short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all. See Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt below for additional information.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are generally greater during the warmer months. The Companys future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by, among other things: customers ability to pay for service in a timely manner, economic utility regulation, inflation, compliance with environmental, health and safety standards, production costs, maintenance costs, customer growth, declining customer usage of water, employee-related costs, including pension funding, weather and seasonality, taxes, and overall economic conditions.\nOperating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the Companys rate regulated environments, changes in the Market-Based Businesses, changes in the economy, interest rates, the timing of tax payments, and the Companys customers ability to pay for service in a timely manner, among other items. The Company can provide no assurance that its customers historical payment pattern will continue in the future. The Companys current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of short-term debt as a funding source, primarily to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, fund acquisitions and construction projects, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors. The Company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from operating activities:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nNet income $ 1,263 $ 709 $ 621\nAdd (less):\nDepreciation and amortization 636 604 582\nDeferred income taxes and amortization of investment tax credits 230 207 208\nOther non-cash activities (a)\n(27) - 4\nChanges in working capital (b)\n126 (49) (5)\nSettlement of cash flow hedges - (6) (30)\nPension and non-pension postretirement benefit contributions (40) (39) (31)\n(Gain) or loss on sale of businesses (747) - 34\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,441 $ 1,426 $ 1,383\n(a)Includes provision for losses on accounts receivable, pension and non-pension postretirement benefits and other non-cash, net. Details of each component can be found on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(b)Changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and other current assets and liabilities, net, less the settlement of cash flow hedges.\nIn 2021, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $15 million, primarily due to an increase in net income, changes in working capital, primarily from an increase in accrued taxes, and an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments. Partially offsetting these increases was the gain on sale of businesses, due to the gain on the sale of HOS.\nThe Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2022. In addition, the Company estimates that contributions will amount to $35 million, $33 million, $30 million and $27 million in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns, among other factors.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from investing activities:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nCapital expenditures $ (1,764) $ (1,822) $ (1,654)\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired (135) (135) (235)\nProceeds from sale of assets, net of cash on hand 472 2 48\nRemoval costs from property, plant and equipment retirements, net (109) (106) (104)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (1,536) $ (2,061) $ (1,945)\nIn 2021, cash flows used in investing activities decreased $525 million primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of HOS and timing of payments for capital expenditures. The Company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories, mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the Companys Regulated Businesses, as discussed below.\nThe Companys infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs, where the Company replaces infrastructure, as needed, and major capital investment projects, where the Company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations. The Companys projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors.\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the Companys capital expenditures by category:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nTransmission and distribution $ 749 $ 704 $ 661\nTreatment and pumping 197 306 190\nServices, meter and fire hydrants 366 333 346\nGeneral structure and equipment 251 299 234\nSources of supply 64 54 83\nWastewater 137 126 140\nTotal capital expenditures $ 1,764 $ 1,822 $ 1,654\nIn 2021, the Companys capital expenditures decreased $58 million primarily due to a decrease in treatment and pumping and general structure and equipment infrastructure investment partially offset by increases in transmission and distribution and services, meter and fire hydrants infrastructure investment.\nThe Company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems. These acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the Companys existing Regulated Businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations. Generally, acquisitions are funded initially with short-term debt, and later refinanced with long-term financing. During 2021, the Company paid $112 million for the acquisition of 23 water and wastewater systems, representing in the aggregate approximately 20,000 customers and paid $23 million in deposits for future acquisitions.\nAs previously noted, over the next five years the Company expects to invest between $13 billion to $14 billion, with $11.5 billion to $12 billion for infrastructure improvements in the Regulated Businesses, and the Company expects to invest between $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years. In 2022, the Company expects to invest $2.5 billion, consisting of $2 billion for infrastructure improvements and $500 million for acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPresented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the Companys cash flows from financing activities:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In millions)\nProceeds from long-term debt $ 1,118 $ 1,334 $ 1,530\nRepayments of long-term debt (372) (342) (495)\n(Repayments of) proceeds from term loan (500) 500 -\nNet short-term borrowings with maturities less than three months (198) (5) (178)\nDividends paid (428) (389) (353)\nAnti-dilutive share repurchases - - (36)\nOther financing activities, net (a)\n35 22 26\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (345) $ 1,120 $ 494\n(a)Includes proceeds from issuances of common stock under various employee stock plans and the Companys dividend reinvestment plan, net of taxes paid, advances and contributions in aid of construction, net of refunds, and debt issuance costs and make-whole premiums on early debt redemption.\nIn 2021, cash flows provided by financing activities decreased $1,465 million, primarily due to the repayment in full at maturity of the $500 million Term Loan Facility during the first quarter of 2021, an increase in net repayments of commercial paper borrowings, higher dividends paid in 2021 and an increase in repayments of long-term debt due to the prepayment of $327 million in aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding senior notes during the second quarter of 2021.\nThe Companys financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures, regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends. These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The Regulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable AWCC to meet its debt service obligations. Parent companys borrowings are not a source of capital for the Regulated Businesses, therefore, parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the Regulated Businesses amounting to $6.7 billion. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, AWCC has made long-term fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting to $3.1 billion.\nOn May 10, 2021, AWCC completed a $1.1 billion debt offering, which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.30% Senior Notes due 2031 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% Senior Notes due 2051. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of $1,086 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to prepay $251 million aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Notes due December 21, 2021 (the Series D Notes) and $76 million aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding 6.55% Series H Senior Notes due May 15, 2023 (the Series H Notes, and together with the Series D Notes, the Series Notes); (iii) to repay AWCCs commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes. After the prepayments described above, none of the Series D Notes, and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of the Series H Notes, remain outstanding. As a result of AWCCs prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Companys utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts (through AWCC) for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. The Company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions, having long-term credit ratings of A or better.\nOn May 10, 2021, the Company terminated two treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $275 million, realizing a net gain of less than $1 million, to be amortized through interest, net over a ten-year period, in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on May 10, 2021. No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIn February 2021, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities, including American Water common stock, preferred stock, and other equity and hybrid securities, and AWCC debt securities, all subject to market conditions and demand, general economic conditions, and as applicable, rating status. The shelf registration statement will expire in February 2024. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, $1.10 billion, $1.00 billion, and $1.10 billion, respectively, of debt securities were issued under this and predecessor registration statements.\nPresented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2021:\nCompany Type Rate\nWeighted Average Rate Maturity Amount\n(in millions)\nAWCC (a)\nSenior notes-fixed rate 2.30%-3.25%\n2.78% 2031-2051\n$ 1,100\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.00%-5.00%\n0.04% 2022-2047\nTotal issuances $ 1,118\n(a)This indebtedness is considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under such indebtedness. See -Issuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes below.\nPresented in the table below are the retirements and redemptions of long-term debt in 2021 through sinking fund provisions, optional redemption or payment at maturity:\nCompany Type Rate\nWeighted Average Rate Maturity Amount\n(in millions)\nAWCC Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 1.79%-6.55%\n5.94% 2021-2031\n$ 327\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity mortgage bonds 9.13%-9.69%\n9.52% 2021 31\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.00%-5.50%\n1.38% 2021-2048\nOther American Water subsidiaries Mandatory redeemable preferred stock 8.49%-8.49%\n8.49% 2022-2022\nTotal retirements and redemptions $ 372\nFrom time to time and as market conditions warrant, the Company may engage in long-term debt retirements through make-whole redemptions, tender offers, open market repurchases or other viable alternatives.\nIssuer and Guarantor of Senior Notes\nThe outstanding senior notes issued by AWCC, the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, have been issued under two indentures, each by and between AWCC and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder. The senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement, as amended, between parent company and AWCC, which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under the senior notes. No other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes. If AWCC is unable to make timely payment of any interest, principal or premium, if any, on such senior notes, parent company will provide to AWCC, at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes, funds to make such payment in full. If AWCC fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if AWCC defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes, when due, the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder.\nAs a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company, AWCC has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its Regulated Businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by AWCC. AWCCs ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon AWCCs receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future, the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes.\nBecause parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than AWCC, parent companys ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries. See Note 10-Shareholders Equity-Dividends and Distributions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions. Furthermore, parent companys operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, other than AWCC, have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment, other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans, if any, with AWCC. Based on the foregoing, parent companys obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables, lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent companys subsidiaries other than AWCC.\nCredit Facilities and Short-Term Debt\nInterest rates on advances under the Companys revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Services and Standard & Poors Financial Services then applicable credit rating on AWCCs senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt. The facility is used principally to support AWCCs commercial paper program and to provide up to $150 million in letters of credit. Indebtedness under the facility and AWCCs commercial paper are considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations thereunder.\nPresented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31:\nCommercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a)\n(In millions)\nTotal availability $ 2,100 $ 150 $ 2,250\nOutstanding debt (584) (76) (660)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2021 $ 1,516 $ 74 $ 1,590\n(a)Total remaining availability of $1.59 billion as of December 31, 2021 may be accessed through revolver draws.\nCommercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a)\n(In millions)\nTotal availability $ 2,100 $ 150 $ 2,250\nOutstanding debt (786) (76) (862)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2020 $ 1,314 $ 74 $ 1,388\n(a)Total remaining availability may be accessed through revolver draws.\nPresented in the table below is the Companys total available liquidity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nCash and Cash Equivalents Availability on Revolving Credit Facility Total Available Liquidity\n(In millions)\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2021 $ 116 $ 1,590 $ 1,706\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2020 547 1,388 1,935\nThe weighted average interest rate on AWCC short-term borrowings, including as of December 31, 2020, $500 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan Facility, was approximately 0.25% and 1.16%, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCapital Structure\nPresented in the table below is the percentage of the Companys capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nTotal common shareholders equity 39.9 % 37.1 % 39.2 %\nLong-term debt and redeemable preferred stock at redemption value 56.6 % 53.6 % 55.6 %\nShort-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 3.5 % 9.3 % 5.2 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\nThe changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the HOS sale, repayment of the Term Loan Facility at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the Companys long-term debt offering that was completed on May 10, 2021.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Companys debt agreements contain financial and non-financial covenants. To the extent that the Company is not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the Company, or its subsidiaries, may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends, issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility. The long-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, prohibit or restrict the Company from issuing debt secured by the Companys assets, subject to certain exceptions. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations.\nCovenants in certain long-term notes and the revolving credit facility require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the relevant documents) of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. On December 31, 2021, the Companys ratio was 0.60 to 1.00 and therefore the Company was in compliance with the covenants.\nSecurity Ratings\nPresented in the table below are long-term and short-term credit ratings and rating outlooks as of February 16, 2022 as issued by the following rating agencies:\nSecurities Moodys Investors Service Standard & Poors Ratings Service\nRating outlook Stable Stable\nSenior unsecured debt Baa1 A\nCommercial paper P-2 A-1\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings. None of the Companys borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.\nAs part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other services. These contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the Company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a credit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its obligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nAccess to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Companys securities ratings. The Company primarily accesses the debt capital markets, including the commercial paper market, through AWCC. However, the Company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries, primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds, to lower the overall cost of debt.\nDividends and Regulatory Restrictions\nFor discussion of the Companys dividends, dividend restrictions and dividend policy, see Note 10-Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInsurance Coverage\nThe Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards. However, insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims. Additionally, annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going-forward basis. The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. Accordingly, changes in the estimates, assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Companys Audit, Finance and Risk Committee, including the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in their application. Additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation and Regulatory Accounting\nThe Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by PUCs and, as such, the Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria: (i) third-party regulation of rates; (ii) cost-based rates; and (iii) a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investment, or rate base. As of December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria.\nApplication of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the Companys financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. The Company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities. Such judgments include, but are not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.\nFor each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial position could be materially affected. In addition, if the Company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria, the Company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business, which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Companys regulatory asset balance was $1.1 billion and its regulatory liability balance was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. See Note 4-Regulatory Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Companys significant regulatory assets and liabilities.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken, as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances and the utilization of NOL carryforwards.\nIn accordance with applicable authoritative guidance, the Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit is recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.\nUnder GAAP, specifically Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Companys deferred taxes were re-measured based upon the new tax rate. For the Companys regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. For the Companys unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment to earnings.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Companys forecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance; however, the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements and such adjustments could be material. See Note 15-Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nAccounting for Pension and Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations. See Note 16-Employee Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe Companys pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Companys pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions are:\nDiscount Rate-The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets (EROA)-Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the Company records currently.\nRate of Compensation Increase-Management projects employees pay increases, which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement.\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate-Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.\nMortality- Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012.\nThe discount rate assumption, which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently, is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans expected cash flows by matching the plans cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments. The discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 2.94%, 2.74% and 3.44% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 2.90%, 2.56% and 3.36% at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn selecting an EROA, the Company considered tax implications, past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans. The long-term EROA assumption used in calculating pension cost was 6.50% for 2021, 6.50% for 2020, and 6.20% for 2019. The weighted average EROA assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 3.67% for 2021, 3.68% for 2020 and 3.56% for 2019.\nPresented in the table below are the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category:\n2022 Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nAsset Category 2021 2020\nEquity securities 43 % 46 % 49 %\nFixed income 50 % 47 % 45 %\nReal Estate 5 % 7 % 6 %\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) 2 % - % - %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\nPostretirement Medical Bargaining Plan Changes\nOn August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured as a result of an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain union and non-union plan participants. The plan change resulted in a $175 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants, and, in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date, resulted in a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining amortization period of the impact of the plan amendment is 6.9 years. As a result of the remeasurement and change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability. Plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the long-term liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and equities.\nPresented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category:\n2022 Target Allocation (a) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31,\nAsset Category 2021 2020\nEquity securities 18 % 22 % 18 %\nFixed income 82 % 78 % 82 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\n(a)Includes the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.\nThe investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds, commingled funds and limited partnerships. The trustee for the Companys defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets.\nIn selecting a rate of compensation increase, the Company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates. The Companys rate of compensation increase was 3.51% for 2021, 3.51% for 2020 and 2.97% for 2019.\nIn selecting health care cost trend rates, the Company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs. As of January 1, 2021, the Companys health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 6.25% in 2021 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2021, the Company projects that medical inflation will be 6.00% in 2022 gradually declining to 5.00% in 2026 and thereafter.\nThe Company will use a discount rate and EROA of 2.94% and 6.50%, respectively, for estimating its 2022 pension costs. Additionally, the Company will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 2.90% and 3.60%, respectively, for estimating its 2022 other postretirement benefit costs. A decrease in the discount rate or the EROA would increase the Companys pension expense. The Companys 2021 pension and postretirement benefit credit was $41 million and the 2020 pension and postretirement benefit credit was $14 million. The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2022, and $35 million, $33 million, $30 million and $27 million in 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. Actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates. The assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations. The impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur, or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from the Companys Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customers actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer.\nIncreases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Companys regulated utilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $162 million and $150 million, respectively.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.\nRevenue from the Companys former HOS business was generated through various protection programs in which the Company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters, power surge protection and other related services. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.\nThe Company also has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. Unbilled revenue for the Market-Based Businesses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $86 million and $56 million, respectively.\nAccounting for Contingencies\nThe Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated. The determination of a loss contingency is based on managements judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter, which may include an analysis of different scenarios. Liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change. In assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible, management considers many factors, which include, but are not limited to: the nature of the litigation, claim or assessment, review of applicable law, opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors, and the experience gained from similar cases or situations. The Company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred. The Company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined, either as a single amount or within a reasonable range.\nActual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities, revenue and expenses recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding contingencies.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recent accounting standards. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates. The Company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper. The Company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1% associated with the Companys short-term borrowings would result in a $8 million increase in short-term interest expense.\nThe Companys risks associated with price increases for chemicals, electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates, in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism, as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction. Non-performance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe market price of the Companys common stock may experience fluctuations, which may be unrelated to its operating performance. In particular, the Companys stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry. These could include, among other things, interest rate movements, quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions. This volatility may make it difficult for the Company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities, regardless of its financial performance, and such difficulty may preclude the Company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and other water-related services provided by the Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses. The Companys Regulated Businesses serve residential, commercial, industrial and other customers, while the Market-Based Businesses engage in business activities with developers, government entities and other customers. The Companys primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances. The Companys credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements. The Companys credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations. In addition, the Regulated Businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates.\nThe Companys retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities. Changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the Companys pension and other benefits expense, funded status and future minimum funding requirements. Changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities. The Company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixed-income securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities, seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities. That way, if interest rates fall and liabilities increase, the Company expects that the fixed-income assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value. The Company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates.\nThe Company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates. The credit quality of the Companys customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes. In addition, there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations. Therefore, the Companys ability to fully recover operating expense, recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the Regulated Businesses may be adversely impacted.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Equity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,067 million and $1,608 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. The Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement. This assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement as a result of changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders, and the status of any pending or potential legislation. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained relating to managements judgments.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Companys regulatory accounting process, including controls over managements assessment and consideration of factors related to the probability of future recovery or settlement. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of managements judgments regarding the probability of recovery and settlement based on the Companys correspondence with regulators, status of regulatory proceedings, past practices, and other relevant information; evaluating the related accounting and disclosure implications; and evaluating regulatory assets and liabilities balances based on provisions and formulas outlined in rate orders and other correspondence with the Companys regulators.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 16, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1948.\nAmerican Water Works Company, Inc. and Subsidiary Companies\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\nASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment $ 27,413 $ 25,614\nAccumulated depreciation (6,329) (5,904)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 21,084 19,710\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents 116 547\nRestricted funds 20 29\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $75 and $60, respectively\n271 321\nUnbilled revenues 248 206\nMaterials and supplies 57 47\nAssets held for sale 683 629\nOther 159 127\nTotal current assets 1,554 1,906\nRegulatory and other long-term assets:\nRegulatory assets 1,051 1,127\nSeller promissory note from the sale of the Homeowner Services Group 720 -\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 92 95\nGoodwill 1,139 1,504\nPostretirement benefit assets 193 173\nIntangible assets -

(the Company or American Water) is a holding company for regulated and market-based subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services throughout the United States. References to parent company mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Companys primary business involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 14 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the Regulated Businesses. The Company also operates other businesses that provide water and wastewater services within non-reportable operating segments, collectively referred to as the Market-Based Businesses. The Companys primary Market-Based Businesses include the Military Services Group (MSG), which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations; and the former Homeowner Services Group (HOS), which provided various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers.\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies\nRegulation\nThe Companys regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as Public Utility Commissions (PUCs). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in the collection of a regulated utilitys revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. See Note 4-Regulatory Matters for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires that management make estimates, assumptions and judgments that could affect the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory accounting principles and the related determination and estimation of regulatory assets and liabilities, (ii) revenue recognition and the estimates used in the calculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining loss contingencies. The Companys critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and liabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Companys regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of retirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and supervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to O&M expense as incurred.\nThe cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Companys regulated utilities record depreciation in conformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets remaining useful lives.\nNonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Companys Market-Based Businesses and for internal operations. This property is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.\nWhen units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated depreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset is recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and before the costs are incurred. These amounts result in a regulatory liability being reported based on the amounts previously recovered through customer rates, until the costs to retire those assets are incurred.\nThe costs incurred to acquire and internally develop computer software for internal use are capitalized as a unit of property. The carrying value of these costs amounted to $374 million and $360 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Funds\nSubstantially all cash is invested in interest-bearing accounts. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted funds consist primarily of proceeds from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities, and deposits for future services under O&M projects. Proceeds are held in escrow or interest-bearing accounts until the designated expenditures are incurred. Restricted funds are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or long-term based upon the intended use of the funds.\nAccounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenues\nAccounts receivable include regulated utility customer accounts receivable, which represent amounts billed to water and wastewater customers generally on a monthly basis. Credit is extended based on the guidelines of the applicable PUCs and collateral is generally not required. Also included are market-based trade accounts receivable and nonutility customer receivables of the regulated subsidiaries. Unbilled revenues are accrued when service has been provided but has not been billed to customers and when costs exceed billings on market-based construction contracts.\nAllowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nAllowances for uncollectible accounts are maintained for estimated probable losses resulting from the Companys inability to collect receivables from customers. Accounts that are outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. A number of factors are considered in determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts, including the length of time receivables are past due, previous loss history, current economic and societal conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of receivables from customers. The Company generally writes off accounts when they become uncollectible or are over a certain number of days outstanding. An increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts for the periods ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 reflects the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and a reduction in amounts written off due to shutoff moratoria in place across the Companys subsidiaries. See Note 8-Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts for additional information.\nMaterials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method.\nSeller Promissory Note\nThe Companys seller promissory note is accounted for under ASC 310, Receivables, and is classified as held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost at the present value of consideration received for the sale of its HOS business. Interest income from the seller promissory note is accrued based on the principal amount outstanding and earned over the contractual life of the loan.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, accrued liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are generally recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of discounted lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROU assets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for certain leases. Certain lease agreements include variable rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Additionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Companys lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a business. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nThe Companys goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Companys previous owner in 2003 and has been allocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the Regulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The goodwill of the Market-Based Businesses is comprised of the MSG reporting unit.\nThe Companys annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Companys annual business plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary. If it is determined, based upon qualitative factors, that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, greater than its carrying value, no further testing is required. If the Company bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its carrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based assessment is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nApplication of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but are not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 9-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consisted primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal Home Solutions in June 2018. Finite-lived intangible assets were initially measured at their estimated fair values and were amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets were consumed or otherwise used. See Note 9-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information. All of the Companys finite-lived intangible assets were sold as part of the HOS sale transaction.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fair value of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-lived assets carrying value compared to its estimated fair value.\nThe long-lived assets of the Companys regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs. A regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value long-lived assets to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAdvances for Construction and Contributions in Aid of Construction\nRegulated utility subsidiaries may receive advances for construction and contributions in aid of construction from customers, home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas.\nAdvances are refundable for limited periods of time as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled. Included in other current liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $23 million, respectively. Those amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.\nAdvances that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular construction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-investor supplied funds.\nGenerally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense, producing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines, some of the Companys utility subsidiaries do not amortize contributions, and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet indefinitely. Amortization of contributions in aid of construction was $36 million, $32 million and $29 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, and all related amendments (collectively, ASC 606), a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a customer. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for goods or services. Under ASC 606, a contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identifies the contracts with a customer; (ii) identifies the performance obligations within the contract, including whether any performance obligations are distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) determines the transaction price; (iv) allocates the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizes revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Companys revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below. Customer payments for contracts are generally due within 30 days of billing and none of the contracts with customers have payment terms that exceed one year; therefore, the Company elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.\nRegulated Businesses Revenue\nRevenue from the Companys Regulated Businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers. These contracts contain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and, therefore, is not distinct. Revenues are recognized over time, as services are provided. There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts that the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customers actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.\nMarket-Based Businesses Revenue\nThe Company has long-term, fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the U.S. government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers. Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company. Additionally, these contracts allow the Company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement. The Company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations, with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period. Losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable. Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues, with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met. Changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined. See Note 5-Revenue Recognition for additional information.\nThrough various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company previously provided fixed fee services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services through its former HOS business. Most of the contracts had a one-year term and each service was a separate performance obligation, satisfied over time, as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service. Customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a one-time, annual fee, with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services. Advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for U.S. tax purposes. Members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns.\nCertain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes. The Company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements. These deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse. In addition, the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences, previously flowed through to customers, reverse.\nInvestment tax credits have been deferred by the regulated utility subsidiaries and are being amortized to income over the average estimated service lives of the related assets.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions as a component of income tax expense and accounts for sales tax collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities on a net basis. See Note 15-Income Taxes for additional information.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC is a non-cash credit to income with a corresponding charge to utility plant that represents the cost of borrowed funds or a return on equity funds devoted to plant under construction. The regulated utility subsidiaries record AFUDC to the extent permitted by the PUCs. The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is shown as a reduction of interest, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Any portion of AFUDC attributable to equity funds would be included in other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Presented in the table below is AFUDC for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nAllowance for other funds used during construction $ 27 $ 30 $ 28\nAllowance for borrowed funds used during construction 10 13 13\nEnvironmental Costs\nThe Companys water and wastewater operations and the operations of its Market-Based Businesses are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign requirements relating to environmental protection, and as such, the Company periodically becomes subject to environmental claims in the normal course of business. Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or provide a future benefit are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that these costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated. A conservation agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Company with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2010 and amended in 2017 required the subsidiary to, among other provisions, implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the Carmel River watershed in the State of California. The subsidiary agreed to pay $1 million annually commencing in 2010 with the final payment made in 2021. No remediation costs were accrued as of December 31, 2021 and $1 million was accrued as of December 31, 2020.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates. These derivative contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company may designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge).\nChanges in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged item, are recorded in current-period earnings. The gains and losses on the effective portion of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. Any ineffective portion of designated cash-flow hedges is recognized in current-period earnings.\nCash flows from derivative contracts are included in net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 12-Long-Term Debt for additional information.\nNew Accounting Standards\nPresented in the table below are new accounting standards that were adopted by the Company in 2021:\nStandard Description Date of Adoption Application Effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting Provided optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential accounting burden associated with the transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The guidance contains optional expedients and exceptions for contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued. The expedients elected must be applied for all eligible contracts or transactions, with the exception of hedging relationships, which can be applied on an individual basis.\nMarch 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 Prospective for contract modifications and hedging relationships; applied as of January 1, 2020. The standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes The guidance removes exceptions related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for changes in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method investment, and the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when the year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss. The guidance adds requirements to reflect changes to tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period in which the changes were enacted, to recognize franchise or other similar taxes that are partially based on income as an income-based tax and any incremental amounts as non-income-based tax, and to evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which the book goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction. January 1, 2021 Modified retrospective for amendments related to changes in ownership of a foreign subsidiary or equity method investment;\nModified retrospective or retrospective for amendments related to taxes partially based on income; Prospective for all other amendments. The standard did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPresented in the table below are recently issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted by the Company as of December 31, 2021:\nStandard Description Date of Adoption Application Estimated Effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity\nSimplification of financial reporting associated with accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entitys own equity. The standard reduced the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. This will result in fewer embedded conversion features being separately recognized from the host contract. Earnings per share (EPS) calculations have been simplified for certain instruments. January 1, 2022 Either modified retrospective or fully retrospective The Company anticipates the adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance The amendments in this update requires additional disclosures regarding government grants and contributions. These disclosures require information on the following three items about these government transactions to be provided: information on the nature of transactions and related accounting policy used to account for transactions, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement affected by these transactions including amounts applicable to each line, and significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies January 1, 2022 Either prospective or retrospective The Company is evaluating any impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting for Contract Asset and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers The guidance requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts. January 1, 2023; early adoption permitted Prospective The Company is evaluating any impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the timing of adoption.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to conform to the current presentation. The Company reclassified $44 million relating to loss on the sale of Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC in 2019 from operating expenses to other income (expenses) included in Gain or (loss) on sale of businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNote 3: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAmerican Water continues to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and has experienced financial impacts since the start of the pandemic resulting from lower revenues from the suspension of late fees and foregone reconnect fees in certain states, certain incremental O&M expenses, an increase in uncollectible accounts expense and additional debt costs. These impacts are collectively referred to as financial impacts.\nAs of February 16, 2022, American Water has commission orders authorizing deferred accounting or cost recovery for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of 13 jurisdictions. Other regulatory actions to date are presented in the table below:\nCommission Actions Description States\nOrders issued with deferred accounting Allows the Company to establish regulatory assets to record certain financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHI, IN, MD, NJ, PA, VA, WV\nOrders issued with cost recovery Californias Catastrophic Event Memorandum Account allows the Companys California subsidiary to track certain financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic for future recovery requests. Iowa issued a base rate case order on June 28, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred within its annual non-recurring expense rider. Illinois has authorized cost recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts through a special purpose rider over a 24-month period, which was implemented effective October 1, 2020. Additionally, Illinois approved a bad debt rider tariff on December 16, 2020, allowing collection of actual bad debt expense over last authorized beginning April 2021 through February 2023. Illinois approved a stipulation in March 2021 to allow the rider to be extended through the end of 2023. Missouri issued a base rate case order on April 7, 2021, authorizing recovery in rates of the COVID-19 financial impacts deferred through March 31, 2021 over a three-year period.\nCA, IA, IL, MO\nThe Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary filed for a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the PaPUC) to defer as a regulatory asset all identified COVID-19 financial impacts. On September 15, 2021, the PaPUC issued an order approving the Companys request to defer, with carrying costs, incremental uncollectible expense and other incremental costs net of savings attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PaPUC order denied the request to include lost revenues attributed to the waiver of late fees and reconnect fees and expenses associated with additional interest costs. Additionally, the PaPUC order approved the request to allow for the continuation of the deferral of financial impacts, rejecting proposals from the intervening parties to define an end date to the deferral in 2021. As a result of the order discussed above, the Company recorded a net $7 million reduction to its regulatory assets and corresponding impacts to revenue, interest expense and uncollectible expense during the third quarter of 2021. The Company continues to evaluate options within its next base rate case to address these denied items and the resulting financial impact.\nOn July 28, 2021, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary filed a stipulation and settlement agreement with the Consumer Advocate Unit in the Financial Division of the Office of the Tennessee Attorney General, which reflected agreement on the deferral of COVID-19-related financial impacts through April 30, 2021. On August 9, 2021, the Tennessee Public Utility Commission denied the stipulation and settlement agreement and moved to address the Companys Tennessee subsidiarys petition to defer the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future hearing. On August 26, 2021, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary filed a motion to withdraw its pending petition, preserving its right to seek recovery of the COVID-19 financial impacts in a future proceeding.\nIn December 2020, the Kentucky Public Service Commission issued an order denying a request to defer to a regulatory asset the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsistent with these regulatory orders, the Company has recorded $36 million in regulatory assets and $6 million of regulatory liabilities for the financial impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of February 16, 2022, one state, New Jersey, continues moratoria until March 15, 2022, on the suspension of service disconnections due to non-payment. The moratoria on disconnects have expired in 12 states.\nNote 4: Regulatory Matters\nGeneral Rate Cases\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, excluding reductions for the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes (EADIT) that are generally offset in income tax expense, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from general rate cases authorizations that became effective during 2019 through 2021:\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nGeneral rate cases by state (a):\nIowa (effective October 11, 2021)\n$ 1 $ - $ -\nMissouri (effective May 28, 2021)\n22 - -\nPennsylvania (effective January 28, 2021)\n70 - -\nCalifornia (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and May 11, 2019)\n22 5 4\nNew Jersey (effective November 1, 2020)\n- 54 -\nIndiana (effective May 1, 2020 and July 1, 2019)\n- 13 4\nKentucky (effective June 28, 2019)\n- - 13\nWest Virginia (effective February 25, 2019)\n- - 19\nMaryland (effective February 5, 2019)\n- - 1\nTotal general rate case authorizations $ 115 $ 72 $ 41\n(a)Excludes authorized increases of $7 million and $4 million in 2021 and 2019, respectively, for the Companys New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nOn November 18, 2021, the California Public Utilities Commission (the CPUC) unanimously approved a final decision in the test year 2021 general rate case filed by the Companys California subsidiary, which is retroactive to January 1, 2021. The Companys California subsidiary received authorization for additional annualized water and wastewater revenues of $22 million, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA). The EADIT reduction in revenues is $4 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. On January 18, 2022, the Companys California subsidiary filed for approval of $13 million in 2022 escalation increases, excluding $4 million of reductions related to the TCJA. This filing, which is retroactive to January 1, 2022, is subject to CPUC approval with a 45-day review period.\nOn June 28, 2021, an order was issued authorizing an increase of $1 million in the general rate case filed by the Companys Iowa subsidiary in 2020. The Companys Iowa subsidiary filed tariffs consistent with the order on September 23, 2021. Effective October 11, 2021, the Iowa Utilities Board approved the tariffs and implemented the new rates.\nOn April 7, 2021, the Companys Missouri subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $22 million, effective May 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the TCJA. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $25 million and is offset by a like reduction in income tax expense. The protected EADIT balance of $72 million is being returned to customers using the average rate assumption method (ARAM), and the unprotected EADIT balance of $74 million is being returned to customers over 10 years. The $25 million EADIT reduction includes both the protected and unprotected catch-up period EADIT of $13 million. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax rate went into effect until new base rates went into effect and will be amortized over 2.5 years.\nOn March 2, 2021, an administrative law judge (ALJ) in the Office of Administrative Law of New Jersey filed an initial decision with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the NJBPU) that recommended denial of a petition filed by the Companys New Jersey subsidiary, which sought approval of acquisition adjustments in rate base of $29 million associated with the acquisitions of Shorelands Water Company, Inc. in 2017 and the Borough of Haddonfields water and wastewater systems in 2015. On July 29, 2021, the NJBPU issued an order adopting the ALJs initial decision without modification. The Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a Notice of Appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division on September 10, 2021. A scheduling order was issued on October 18, 2021 establishing a briefing schedule through March 2022. There is no financial impact to the Company as a result of the NJBPUs order, since the acquisition adjustments are currently recorded as goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn February 25, 2021, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million, effective January 28, 2021, excluding agreed to reductions for EADIT as a result of the TCJA, over two steps. The EADIT reduction in revenues is $19 million. The overall increase, net of TCJA reductions, is $71 million in revenues combined over two steps. The first step was effective January 28, 2021 in the amount of $70 million ($51 million including TCJA reductions) and the second step will be effective January 1, 2022 in the amount of $20 million. The protected EADIT balance of $200 million is being returned to customers using the ARAM, and the unprotected EADIT balance of $116 million is being returned to customers over 20 years. The $19 million annually includes both the protected and unprotected EADIT amortizations and a portion of catch-up period EADIT. A bill credit of $11 million annually for two years returns to customers the remainder of the EADIT catch-up period amortization. The catch-up period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 covers the period from when the lower federal corporate income tax rate went into effect until new base rates went into effect and will be amortized over two years.\nPending General Rate Case Filings\nOn February 10, 2022, the Companys Illinois subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $71 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $110 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges.\nOn December 1, 2021, the Companys Kentucky subsidiary filed a wastewater rate case requesting additional revenues of $1 million, excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA. The Company requested a four-step rate increase for their wastewater operations with effective dates of June 1, 2022, June 1, 2023, June 1, 2024 and June 1, 2025 for annual amounts of less than $1 million each year. The Company filed their wastewater case under the alternative rate filing process for smaller utilities which calculates an operating ratio of 88% rather than a return on equity.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Companys Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $15 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA.\nOn August 18, 2021, the Companys Hawaii subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $2 million in additional annualized revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting $32 million in annualized incremental revenues excluding proposed reductions for EADIT as a result of TCJA and infrastructure surcharges. The proposed EADIT reduction in revenues is $1 million and the exclusion for infrastructure surcharges is $10 million. Intervenor testimony was received on September 20, 2021. The Companys rebuttal testimony was filed on October 5, 2021. Hearings were conducted on November 3 and 4, 2021. A final order is expected no later than February 24, 2022.\nThe Companys California subsidiary submitted its application on May 3, 2021 to set its cost of capital for 2022 through 2024. According to the CPUCs process, a decision is expected to be issued, setting the authorized cost of capital in the third quarter of 2022.\nInfrastructure Surcharges\nA number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments, such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure. Presented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective during 2019 through 2021:\n(In millions) 2021 2020 2019\nInfrastructure surcharges by state (a):\nNew Jersey (b)\n$ 26 $ 20 $ 15\nMissouri (c)\n7 12 14\nKentucky (effective July 1, 2021 and July 1, 2020)\n1 1 -\nIndiana (effective March 17, 2021)\n8 - -\nPennsylvania (d)\n8 27 11\nIllinois (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2019)\n7 7 8\nWest Virginia (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2019)\n5 3 2\nTennessee (effective January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and September 1, 2019)\n3 2 1\nTotal infrastructure surcharge authorizations $ 65 $ 72 $ 51\n(a)Excludes authorized increases of $2 million in 2019 for the Companys New York subsidiary, which was sold on January 1, 2022. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\n(b)In 2021, $12 million was effective on December 30 and $14 million was effective June 28. In 2020, $10 million was effective June 29 and $10 million was effective January 1. In 2019, the effective date was July 1.\n(c)In 2021, the effective date was October 7. In 2020, $2 million was effective December 14 and $10 million was effective June 27. In 2019, $5 million was effective December 21 and $9 million was effective June 24.\n(d)In 2021, the effective date was January 1. In 2020, $8 million was effective October 1, $4 million was effective July 1, $5 million was effective April 1 and $10 million was effective January 1. In 2019, $6 million was effective October 1, $3 million was effective July 1 and $2 million was effective April 1.\nPresented in the table below are annualized incremental revenues, assuming a constant water sales volume, resulting from infrastructure surcharge authorizations that became effective after January 1, 2022:\n(In millions) Amount\nInfrastructure surcharge filings by state:\nIllinois (effective January 1, 2022) $ 6\nMissouri (effective February 1, 2022) 12\nTotal infrastructure surcharge filings $ 18\nPending Infrastructure Surcharge Filings\nOn January 19, 2022, the Companys Indiana subsidiary filed for infrastructure surcharges requesting $8 million in additional annualized revenues.\nOn June 30, 2021, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge requesting $3 million in additional annualized revenues.\nRegulatory Assets\nRegulatory assets represent costs that are probable of recovery from customers in future rates. Approximately 50% of the Companys total regulatory asset balance at December 31, 2021 earns a return. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory assets as of December 31:\n2021 2020\nDeferred pension expense $ 323 $ 374\nRemoval costs recoverable through rates 313 314\nRegulatory balancing accounts 52 57\nOther 439 446\nLess: Regulatory assets included in assets held for sale (a)\n(76) (64)\nTotal regulatory assets $ 1,051 $ 1,127\n(a)These regulatory assets are related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nThe Companys deferred pension expense includes a portion of the underfunded status that is probable of recovery through rates in future periods of $317 million and $366 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining portion is the pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans which is deferred by certain subsidiaries and will be recovered in future service rates as contributions are made to the pension plan.\nRemoval costs recoverable through rates represent costs incurred for removal of property, plant and equipment or other retirement costs.\nRegulatory balancing accounts accumulate differences between revenues recognized and authorized revenue requirements until they are collected from customers or are refunded. Regulatory balancing accounts include low income programs and purchased power and water accounts.\nOther regulatory assets include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, purchase premium recoverable through rates, tank painting costs, certain construction costs for treatment facilities, property tax stabilization, employee-related costs, business services project expenses, coastal water project costs, rate case expenditures and environmental remediation costs among others. These costs are deferred because the amounts are being recovered in rates or are probable of recovery through rates in future periods.\nThe Company has current regulatory assets of $16 million and $13 million included in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is primarily made up of deferred vacation pay.\nRegulatory Liabilities\nRegulatory liabilities generally represent amounts that are probable of being credited or refunded to customers through the rate making process. Also, if costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates, the Company records those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities. Presented in the table below is the composition of regulatory liabilities as of December 31:\n2021 2020\nIncome taxes recovered through rates $ 1,093 $ 1,230\nRemoval costs recovered through rates 291 301\nPostretirement benefit liability 153 170\nOther 110 111\nLess: Regulatory liabilities included in liabilities related to assets held for sale (a)\n(47) (42)\nTotal regulatory liabilities $ 1,600 $ 1,770\n(a)These regulatory liabilities are related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nIncome taxes recovered through rates relate to deferred taxes that will likely be refunded to the Companys customers. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. The enactment of the TCJA required a re-measurement of the Companys deferred income taxes. The portion of this re-measurement related to the Regulated Businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as EADIT will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates. Twelve of the Companys regulated subsidiaries are amortizing EADIT and crediting customers. The Company expects the timing of the amortization of EADIT credits for the one remaining regulated subsidiary to be addressed in a pending or future rate case or other proceedings.\nRemoval costs recovered through rates are estimated costs to retire assets at the end of their expected useful lives that are recovered through customer rates over the lives of the associated assets.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan was remeasured to reflect an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain union and non-union plan participants. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company recorded a $227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, with a corresponding regulatory liability.\nOther regulatory liabilities include the financial impacts relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, TCJA reserve on revenue, pension and other postretirement benefit balancing accounts, legal settlement proceeds, deferred gains and various regulatory balancing accounts.\nThe Company has current regulatory liabilities of $8 million and $6 million included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which primarily is made up of TCJA reserve on revenue.\nNote 5: Revenue Recognition\nDisaggregated Revenues\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\nResidential $ 1,935 $ - $ 1,935\nCommercial 676 - 676\nFire service 151 - 151\nIndustrial 141 - 141\nPublic and other 230 - 230\nTotal water services 3,133 - 3,133\nWastewater services:\nResidential 151 - 151\nCommercial 37 - 37\nIndustrial 4 - 4\nPublic and other 16 - 16\nTotal wastewater services 208 - 208\nMiscellaneous utility charges 26 - 26\nAlternative revenue programs - 9 9\nLease contract revenue - 8 8\nTotal Regulated Businesses 3,367 17 3,384\nMarket-Based Businesses 563 - 563\nOther (16) (1) (17)\nTotal operating revenues $ 3,914 $ 16 $ 3,930\n(a)Includes revenues associated with provisional rates, alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\nResidential $ 1,895 $ - $ 1,895\nCommercial 627 - 627\nFire service 147 - 147\nIndustrial 133 - 133\nPublic and other 201 - 201\nTotal water services 3,003 - 3,003\nWastewater services:\nResidential 134 - 134\nCommercial 34 - 34\nIndustrial 3 - 3\nPublic and other 14 - 14\nTotal wastewater services 185 - 185\nMiscellaneous utility charges 32 - 32\nAlternative revenue programs - 25 25\nLease contract revenue - 10 10\nTotal Regulated Businesses 3,220 35 3,255\nMarket-Based Businesses 540 - 540\nOther (17) (1) (18)\nTotal operating revenues $ 3,743 $ 34 $ 3,777\n(a)Includes revenues associated with provisional rates, alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\nPresented in the table below are operating revenues disaggregated for the year ended December 31, 2019:\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers Other Revenues Not from Contracts with Customers (a) Total Operating Revenues\nRegulated Businesses:\nWater services:\nResidential $ 1,734 $ 1 $ 1,735\nCommercial 639 - 639\nFire service 142 - 142\nIndustrial 138 - 138\nPublic and other 214 - 214\nTotal water services 2,867 1 2,868\nWastewater services:\nResidential 119 - 119\nCommercial 31 - 31\nIndustrial 3 - 3\nPublic and other 14 - 14\nTotal wastewater services 167 - 167\nMiscellaneous utility charges 36 - 36\nAlternative revenue programs - 16 16\nLease contract revenue - 7 7\nTotal Regulated Businesses 3,070 24 3,094\nMarket-Based Businesses 539 - 539\nOther (22) (1) (23)\nTotal operating revenues $ 3,587 $ 23 $ 3,610\n(a)Includes revenues associated with provisional rates, alternative revenue programs, lease contracts and intercompany rent, which are outside the scope of ASC 606, and accounted for under other existing GAAP.\nContract Balances\nContract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections. In the Companys Market-Based Businesses, certain contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Contract assets are recorded when billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition and are reclassified to accounts receivable when billed and the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities are recorded when the Company receives advances from customers prior to satisfying contractual performance obligations, particularly for construction contracts, and are recognized as revenue when the associated performance obligations are satisfied.\nContract assets of $71 million, $39 million and $13 million are included in unbilled revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were $71 million of contract assets added during 2021, and $39 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2021. There were $60 million of contract assets added during 2020, and $34 million of contract assets were transferred to accounts receivable during 2020.\nContract liabilities of $19 million, $35 million and $27 million are included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were $152 million of contract liabilities added during 2021, and $168 million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2021. There were $120 million of contract liabilities added during 2020, and $112 million of contract liabilities were recognized as revenue during 2020.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPOs) represent revenues the Company expects to recognize in the future from contracts that are in progress. The Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Companys O&M and capital improvement contracts in the Market-Based Businesses have RPOs. Contracts with the U.S. government for work on various military installations expire between 2051 and 2071 and have RPOs of $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Such contracts are subject to customary termination provisions held by the U.S. government, prior to the agreed-upon contract expiration. Contracts with municipalities and commercial customers expire between 2022 and 2038 and have RPOs of $584 million as of December 31, 2021, as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue. Some of the Companys long-term contracts to operate and maintain the federal governments, a municipalitys or other partys water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain maintenance for some of those facilities, in exchange for an annual fee. Unless specifically required to perform certain maintenance activities, the maintenance costs are recognized when the maintenance is performed.\nNote 6: Acquisitions and Divestitures\nRegulated Businesses\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2021, the Company closed on 23 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $112 million, which added approximately 20,000 water and wastewater customers, including the acquisitions of the East Pasadena Water Company in California on September 23, 2021 for $34 million, the water and wastewater system assets of Valley Township in Pennsylvania on November 19, 2021 for $21 million and the Lowell water system in Indiana on December 28, 2021 for $25 million. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $114 million and liabilities assumed totaled $2 million. Several of these acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. The preliminary purchase price allocations related to acquisitions accounted for as business combinations will be finalized once the valuation of assets acquired has been completed, no later than one year after their acquisition date.\nOn April 6, 2021, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the wastewater assets of the York City Sewer Authority for $235 million, plus an amount of average daily revenue calculated for the period between the final meter reading and the date of closing. This system, directly and indirectly through bulk contracts, serves more than 45,000 customers. In connection with the execution of the acquisition agreement, the Companys Pennsylvania subsidiary paid a $20 million deposit to the seller on April 30, 2021, which is refundable in the event the agreement is terminated prior to closing of the acquisition. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the first half of 2022, pending regulatory approval.\nOn March 29, 2021, the Companys New Jersey subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City for $22 million. The water and wastewater systems currently serve approximately 1,500 customers each, or 3,000 combined, and are being sold through the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act process. The Company expects to close this acquisition in the second half of 2022, pending regulatory approval.\nDuring 2020, the Company closed on 23 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $135 million. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $159 million and liabilities assumed totaled $29 million, including $21 million of contributions in aid of construction and assumed debt of $7 million. The Company recorded additional goodwill of $5 million associated with two of its acquisitions, which is reported in its Regulated Businesses segment.\nDuring 2019, the Company closed on 21 acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of $235 million. Assets acquired from these acquisitions, principally utility plant, totaled $237 million and liabilities assumed, primarily contributions in aid of construction, totaled $5 million. The Company recorded additional goodwill of $3 million associated with three of its acquisitions, which is reported in its Regulated Businesses segment.\nAssets Held for Sale\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously disclosed sale of its regulated utility operations in New York to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (Liberty), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Companys New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Companys regulated New York operations represented approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. The assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nPresented in the table below are the components of assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale of the New York subsidiary as of December 31, 2021:\nDecember 31, 2021\nProperty, plant and equipment $ 556\nCurrent assets 18\nRegulatory assets 76\nGoodwill 27\nOther assets 6\nAssets held for sale $ 683\nCurrent liabilities 13\nRegulatory liabilities 47\nOther liabilities 23\nLiabilities related to assets held for sale $ 83\nSale of Michigan American Water Company\nOn February 4, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its operations in Michigan for approximately $6 million.\nSale of Homeowner Services Group\nOn December 9, 2021 (the Closing Date), the Company sold all of the equity interests in subsidiaries that comprised HOS to a wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by Apax Partners LLP, a global private equity advisory firm (the Buyer), for total consideration of approximately $1.275 billion, resulting in pre-tax gain on sale of $748 million. The consideration is comprised of $480 million in cash, a seller promissory note issued by the Buyer in the principal amount of $720 million, and a contingent cash payment of $75 million payable upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or before December 31, 2023. See Note 19-Fair Value of Financial Information for additional information relating to the seller promissory note and contingent cash payment.\nThe seller note has a five-year term, is payable in cash, and bears interest at a rate of 7.00% per year during the term. The repayment obligations of the Buyer under the seller note have been secured by a first priority security interest in certain property of the Buyer and the former HOS subsidiaries, including their cash and securities accounts, as well as a pledge of the equity interests in each of those subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations and exceptions. The seller note requires compliance with affirmative and negative covenants (subject to certain conditions, limitations and exceptions), including a covenant limiting the incurrence by the Buyer and certain affiliates of additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds, but does not include any financial maintenance covenants.\nBeginning December 9, 2024, the Company has a put right pursuant to which it may require the seller note to be repaid in full at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest, except that upon the occurrence of a disruption event in the broadly syndicated term loan B debt financing market, repayment by the Buyer pursuant to the Companys exercise of the put right will be delayed until the market disruption event ends.\nThe seller note may not be prepaid at the Buyers election except in certain limited circumstances before the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. If the Buyer seeks to repay the seller note in breach of this non-call provision, an event of default will occur under the seller note and the Company may, among other actions, demand repayment in full together with a premium ranging from 105.5% to 107.5% of the outstanding principal amount of the loan and a customary make-whole payment.\nThe Company and the Buyer also entered into a revenue share agreement, pursuant to which the Company is to receive 10% of the revenue generated from customers who are billed for home warranty services through an applicable Company subsidiary (an on-bill arrangement), and 15% of the revenue generated from any future on-bill arrangements entered into after the closing. Unless earlier terminated, this agreement has a term of up to 15 years, which may be renewed for up to two five-year periods.\nThe pro forma impact of the Companys divestitures was not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nNote 7: Property, Plant and Equipment\nPresented in the table below are the major classes of property, plant and equipment by category as of December 31:\n2021 2020 Range of Remaining Useful Lives Weighted Average Useful Life\nUtility plant:\nLand and other non-depreciable assets $ 210 $ 174\nSources of supply 938 897 2 to 127 years\n46 years\nTreatment and pumping facilities 4,198 3,984 3 to 111 years\n39 years\nTransmission and distribution facilities 12,308 11,457 9 to 130 years\n69 years\nServices, meters and fire hydrants 4,888 4,555 5 to 90 years\n31 years\nGeneral structures and equipment 2,200 2,003 1 to 109 years\n15 years\nWaste collection 1,363 1,288 5 to 113 years\n58 years\nWaste treatment, pumping and disposal 912 859 2 to 139 years\n38 years\nConstruction work in progress 934 837\nLess: Utility plant included in assets held for sale (a)\n(664) (646)\nTotal utility plant 27,287 25,408\nNonutility property 126 211 3 to 50 years\n6 years\nLess: Nonutility plant included in assets held for sale (a)\n- (5)\nTotal property, plant and equipment $ 27,413 $ 25,614\n(a)This property, plant and equipment is related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and is included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nProperty, plant and equipment depreciation expense amounted to $550 million, $520 million and $508 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively and was included in depreciation and amortization expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provision for depreciation expressed as a percentage of the aggregate average depreciable asset balances was 2.77%, 2.82% and 2.96% for years December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the Company had capital expenditures acquired on account but unpaid of $292 million and $221 million included in accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn 2019, the Company completed and submitted its project completion certification to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) in connection with its capital investment in its corporate headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The NJEDA determined that the Company is qualified to receive $164 million in tax credits over a ten-year period. The Company is required to meet various annual requirements in order to monetize one-tenth of the tax credits annually and is subject to a claw-back period if the Company does not meet certain NJEDA requirements of the tax credit program in years 11 through 15. The Company has made the necessary annual filings for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 and expects to file the 2021 filing by April 30, 2022. As a result, the Company had receivables of $49 million and $115 million in other current assets and other long-term assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021. The submitted filings are under review by the NJEDA and it is expected that the Company will receive final NJEDA approval and monetize the credits in the first half of 2022.\nIn March 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the NJEDA, pursuant to Executive Order 103 - State of Emergency and a Public Health Emergency, temporarily waived the requirement that a full-time employee must spend at least 80% of his or her time at the qualified business facility (QBF) to meet the definition of eligible position or full-time job. The waiver will continue for as long as New Jerseys Executive Order 281 is valid. On July 2, 2021, New Jerseys Governor approved a bill that revised provisions of the Economic Recovery Act of 2020 and other economic development programs, including amending the definition of an eligible position and full-time job in the Grow New Jersey Program and replacing the 80% requirement of time spent at the QBF. The bill states that an eligible position is one that is filled by a full-time employee who has their primary office at the QBF and spends at least 60% of their time at the QBF. The bill specifically states that it supersedes the existing regulations and existing incentive agreements that require an eligible employee spend at least 80% of their time at the QBF.\nNote 8: Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts\nPresented in the table below are the changes in the allowances for uncollectible accounts for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nBalance as of January 1 $ (60) $ (41) $ (45)\nAmounts charged to expense (37) (34) (28)\nAmounts written off 17 12 32\nLess: Allowance for uncollectible accounts included in assets held for sale (a) 5 3 -\nBalance as of December 31 $ (75) $ (60) $ (41)\n(a)This portion of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and is included in assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nIn 2021, the Company reduced goodwill by $370 million included in Market-Based Businesses through the sale of HOS. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information relating to the sale of HOS.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of November 30, 2021, which included qualitative assessments of its Regulated Businesses and MSG reporting units. Based on these assessments, the Company determined that there were no factors present that would indicate that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their respective carrying values as of November 30, 2021.\nIn 2020, the Company acquired goodwill of $5 million associated with two of its acquisitions in the Regulated Businesses segment.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company held finite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships and other intangible assets prior to the sale of HOS during the fourth quarter of 2021. All of the Companys finite-lived intangible assets were sold as part of the HOS sale transaction. As a result, there was no gross carrying value or net book value of customer relationships and other intangible assets remaining as of December 31, 2021. The gross carrying value of customer relationships and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2020 was $78 million and $13 million, respectively. Accumulated amortization of customer relationships and other intangible assets was $29 million and $7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Intangible asset amortization expense amounted to $9 million, $12 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense related to customer relationships and other intangible assets was $7 million and $2 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNote 10: Shareholders Equity\nCommon Stock\nUnder the Companys dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan (the DRIP), shareholders may reinvest cash common stock dividends and purchase additional shares of Company common stock, up to certain limits, through the plan administrator without paying brokerage commissions. Shares purchased by participants through the DRIP may be newly issued shares, treasury shares, or at the Companys election, shares purchased by the plan administrator in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases generally will be made and credited to DRIP accounts once each week. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 5.1 million shares available for future issuance under the DRIP.\nAnti-dilutive Stock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2015, the Companys Board of Directors authorized an anti-dilutive stock repurchase program, which allows the Company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock from time to time over an unrestricted period of time. The Company did not repurchase shares of common stock during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, there were 5.1 million shares of common stock available for purchase under the program.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nPresented in the table below are the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nDefined Benefit Plans Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedge Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nEmployee Benefit Plan Funded Status Amortization of Prior Service Cost Amortization of Actuarial Loss\nBeginning balance as of January 1, 2020 $ (94) $ 1 $ 60 $ (3) $ (36)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification (12) - - (4) (16)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss - - 3 - 3\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (12) - 3 (4) (13)\nEnding balance as of December 31, 2020 $ (106) $ 1 $ 63 $ (7) $ (49)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification (1) - - 1 -\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss - - 4 - 4\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) (1) - 4 1 4\nEnding balance as of December 31, 2021 $ (107) $ 1 $ 67 $ (6) $ (45)\nThe Company does not reclassify the amortization of defined benefit pension cost components from accumulated other comprehensive loss directly to net income in its entirety, as a portion of these costs have been deferred as a regulatory asset. These accumulated other comprehensive loss components are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 16-Employee Benefits for additional information.\nThe amortization of the gain (loss) on cash flow hedges is reclassified to net income during the period incurred and is included in interest, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDividends and Distributions\nThe Companys Board of Directors authorizes the payment of dividends. The Companys ability to pay dividends on its common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity, net income and cash flows of the Companys subsidiaries, the receipt of dividends and direct and indirect distributions from, and repayments of indebtedness of, the Companys subsidiaries, compliance with Delaware corporate and other laws, compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors.\nThe Companys dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration, among other factors, current and possible future developments that may affect the Companys income and cash flows. When dividends on common stock are declared, they are typically paid in March, June, September and December. Historically, dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the distribution date. Since the dividends on the Companys common stock are not cumulative, only declared dividends are paid.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company paid $428 million, $389 million and $353 million in cash dividends, respectively. Presented in the table below is the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nDecember $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 $ 0.50\nSeptember $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 $ 0.50\nJune $ 0.6025 $ 0.55 $ 0.50\nMarch $ 0.55 $ 0.50 $ 0.455\nOn December 9, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.6025 per share payable on March 1, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2022.\nUnder applicable law, the Companys subsidiaries may pay dividends on their capital stock or other equity only from retained, undistributed or current earnings. A significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the amount of the dividend that the subsidiary can pay. The ability of the Companys subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends, make other upstream distributions or repay indebtedness to parent company or American Water Capital Corp. (AWCC), the Companys wholly owned financing subsidiary, as applicable, is subject to compliance with applicable corporate, tax and other laws, regulatory restrictions and financial and other contractual obligations, including, for example, (i) regulatory capital, surplus or net worth requirements, (ii) outstanding debt service obligations, (iii) requirements to make preferred and preference stock dividend payments, and (iv) other contractual agreements, covenants or obligations made or entered into by the Company and its subsidiaries.\nRegulatory Restrictions on Indebtedness\nThe issuance of long-term debt or equity securities by the Company or long-term debt by AWCC does not require authorization of any state PUC if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and parent company, AWCC may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide these borrowings to the Regulated Businesses or parent company. PUC authorization is generally required for the regulated subsidiaries to incur long-term debt. The Companys regulated subsidiaries normally obtain these required PUC authorizations on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time, or, as necessary, in connection with a specific financing or refinancing of debt.\nNote 11: Stock Based Compensation\nThe Company has granted stock options, stock units and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and other key employees of the Company pursuant to the terms of its 2007 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2007 Plan). Stock units under the 2007 Plan generally vest based on (i) continued employment with the Company (RSUs), or (ii) continued employment with the Company where distribution of the shares is subject to the satisfaction in whole or in part of stated performance-based goals (PSUs). The 2007 Plan has been replaced by the 2017 Omnibus Plan, as defined below, and no additional awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan. However, shares may still be issued under the 2007 Plan pursuant to the terms of awards previously issued under that plan prior to May 12, 2017.\nIn May 2017, the Companys shareholders approved the American Water Works Company, Inc. 2017 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the 2017 Omnibus Plan). The Company has granted stock units, including RSUs and PSUs, stock awards and dividend equivalents to non-employee directors, officers and employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. A total of 7.2 million shares of common stock may be issued under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. As of December 31, 2021, 6.5 million shares were available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The 2017 Omnibus Plan provides that grants of awards may be in any of the following forms: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock units, stock awards, other stock-based awards and dividend equivalents. Dividend equivalents may be granted only on stock units or other stock-based awards. The 2017 Omnibus Plan expires in 2027.\nThe cost of services received from employees in exchange for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards issued. The value of stock options and stock unit awards at the date of the grant is amortized through expense over the requisite service period. All awards granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 are classified as equity. The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock awards over the vesting period of the award. The Company stratified its grant populations and used historic employee turnover rates to estimate employee forfeitures. The estimated rate is compared to the actual forfeitures at the end of the reporting period and adjusted as necessary. There have been no significant adjustments to the forfeiture rates during 2021, 2020 and 2019. There were no grants of stock options to employees after 2016, and the remaining stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were not material. Presented in the table below is the stock-based compensation expense recorded in O&M expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nRSUs and PSUs $ 15 $ 19 $ 15\nNonqualified employee stock purchase plan 2 2 2\nStock-based compensation 17 21 17\nIncome tax benefit (4) (5) (4)\nStock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 13 $ 16 $ 13\nThere were no significant stock-based compensation costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nSubject to limitations on deductibility imposed by the Federal income tax code, the Company receives a tax deduction based on the intrinsic value of the award at the exercise date for stock options and the distribution date for stock units. For each award, throughout the requisite service period, the Company records the tax impacts related to compensation costs as deferred income tax assets. The tax deductions in excess of the deferred benefits recorded throughout the requisite service period are recorded to the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are presented in the financing section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nStock Units\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted RSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. RSUs generally vest based on continued employment with the Company over periods ranging from one to three years.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted stock units to non-employee directors under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The stock units were vested in full on the date of grant; however, distribution of the shares will be made within 30 days of the earlier of (i) 15 months after the date of the last annual meeting of shareholders, subject to any deferral election by the director, or (ii) the participants separation from service. Because these stock units vested on the grant date, the total grant date fair value was recorded in operation and maintenance expense on the grant date.\nThe RSUs are valued at the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant and the majority vest ratably over a three-year service period. These RSUs are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method.\nPresented in the table below is RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nShares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share)\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2020 92 $ 100.39\nGranted 45 158.54\nVested (76) 122.26\nForfeited (13) 128.93\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2021 48 $ 112.22\nAs of December 31, 2021, $3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested RSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of 1.33 years. The total fair value of stock units and RSUs vested was $9 million, $5 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted PSUs to certain employees under the 2017 Omnibus Plan. The majority of PSUs vest ratably based on continued employment with the Company over the three-year performance period (the Performance Period). Distribution of the performance shares is contingent upon the achievement of one or more internal performance measures and, separately, a relative total shareholder return performance measure, over the Performance Period.\nPresented in the table below is PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nShares (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value (per share)\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2020 293 $ 105.70\nGranted 145 128.30\nVested (186) 75.47\nForfeited (20) 159.99\nNon-vested total as of December 31, 2021 232 $ 139.40\nAs of December 31, 2021, $3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested PSUs is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of 0.71 years. The total fair value of PSUs vested was $22 million, $18 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPSUs granted with one or more internal performance measures are valued at the market value of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. PSUs granted with a relative total shareholder return condition are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities of traded common stock of the Company and comparative companies using daily stock prices over the past three years. The expected term is three years and the risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury rate in effect as of the measurement date. Presented in the table below are the weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and the weighted average grant date fair values of PSUs granted for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nExpected volatility 28.59% 16.65% 16.80%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.22% 1.28% 2.47%\nExpected life (years) 3.0 3.0 3.0\nGrant date fair value per share $229.22 $159.64 $110.37\nThe grant date fair value of PSUs that vest ratably and have market and/or performance conditions are amortized through expense over the requisite service period using the graded-vesting method.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company maintains a nonqualified employee stock purchase plan (the ESPP) that expires in 2027 through which employee participants (other than the Companys executive officers) may use payroll deductions to acquire Company common stock at a purchase price of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock at the end of a three-month purchase period. A total of 2.0 million shares may be issued under the ESPP, and as of December 31, 2021, there were 1.6 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The ESPP is considered compensatory. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued 80 thousand, 86 thousand and 88 thousand shares, respectively, under the ESPP.\nNote 12: Long-Term Debt\nThe Company obtains long-term debt through AWCC primarily to fund capital expenditures of the Regulated Businesses and to lend funds to parent company to refinance debt and for other purposes. Presented in the table below are the components of long-term debt as of December 31:\nRate Weighted Average Rate Maturity 2021 2020\nLong-term debt of AWCC: (a)\nSenior notes-fixed rate 2.30%-8.27%\n3.83% 2023-2051\n$ 8,965 $ 8,191\nPrivate activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.60%-2.45%\n1.63% 2023-2031\n190 191\nLong-term debt of other American Water subsidiaries:\nPrivate activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.00%-5.50%\n1.70% 2022-2048\n739 735\nMortgage bonds-fixed rate 6.35%-9.19%\n7.36% 2023-2039\n534 565\nMandatorily redeemable preferred stock 8.47%-9.75%\n8.60% 2024-2036\n4 5\nFinance lease obligations 12.25% 12.25% 2026 1 1\nLong-term debt 10,433 9,688\nUnamortized debt (discount) premium, net (b)\n(9) (4)\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (23) (22)\nLess current portion of long-term debt (57) (329)\nTotal long-term debt $ 10,344 $ 9,333\n(a)This indebtedness is considered debt for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and AWCC, which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of AWCCs payment obligations under such indebtedness.\n(b)Includes debt discount, net of fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting.\nAll mortgage bonds and $738 million of the private activity bonds and government funded debt held by the Companys subsidiaries were collateralized as of December 31, 2021.\nLong-term debt indentures contain a number of covenants that, among other things, limit, subject to certain exceptions, AWCC from issuing debt secured by the Companys consolidated assets. Certain long-term notes require the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 0.60 to 1.00. In addition, the Company has $859 million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes at par value, in whole or in part, from time to time, subject to certain restrictions, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.84%.\nPresented in the table below are future sinking fund payments and debt maturities:\nAmount\n2022 $ 57\n2023 280\n2024 474\n2025 597\n2026 441\nThereafter 8,584\nPresented in the table below are the issuances of long-term debt in 2021:\nCompany Type Rate\nWeighted Average Rate Maturity Amount\nAWCC Senior notes-fixed rate 2.30%-3.25%\n2.78% 2031-2051\n$ 1,100\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.00%-5.00%\n0.04% 2022-2047\nTotal issuances $ 1,118\nThe Company incurred debt issuance costs of $11 million related to the above issuances.\nPresented in the table below are the retirements and redemptions of long-term debt in 2021 through sinking fund provisions, optional redemption or payment at maturity:\nCompany Type Rate\nWeighted Average Rate Maturity Amount\nAWCC Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 1.79%-6.55%\n5.94% 2021-2031\n$ 327\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity mortgage bonds 9.13%-9.69%\n9.52% 2021\nOther American Water subsidiaries Private activity bonds and government funded debt-fixed rate 0.00%-5.50%\n1.38% 2021-2048\nOther American Water subsidiaries Mandatory redeemable preferred stock 8.49%-8.49%\n8.49% 2022-2022\nTotal retirements and redemptions $ 372\nOn May 10, 2021, AWCC completed a $1.1 billion debt offering which included the sale of $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.30% senior notes due 2031 and $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.25% senior notes due 2051. At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of $1,086 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to prepay $251 million aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding 5.77% Series D Senior Notes due December 21, 2021 (the Series D Notes) and $76 million aggregate principal amount of AWCCs outstanding 6.55% Series H Senior Notes due May 15, 2023 (the Series H Notes, and together with the Series D Notes, the Series Notes); (iii) to repay AWCCs commercial paper obligations; and (iv) for general corporate purposes. After the prepayments described above, none of the Series D Notes, and approximately $14 million aggregate principal amount of the Series H Notes, remain outstanding. As a result of AWCCs prepayment of the Series Notes, a make-whole premium of $15 million was paid to the holders thereof on June 14, 2021. Substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the Companys utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets, as the Company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates.\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps. The Company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments. The derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, creditworthy financial institutions having long-term credit ratings of A or better.\nOn May 6, 2021, the Company entered into two 10-year treasury lock agreements, with notional amounts of $125 million and $150 million, to reduce interest rate exposure on debt, which was subsequently issued on May 10, 2021. These treasury lock agreements had an average fixed rate of 1.58%. The Company designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. On May 10, 2021, the Company terminated these two treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $275 million, realizing a net gain of less than $1 million, to be amortized through interest, net over a 10-year period, in accordance with the terms of the $1.1 billion new debt issued on May 10, 2021. No ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 13: Short-Term Debt\nLiquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are generally funded through cash flows from operations, public and private debt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility. Additionally, proceeds from the aforementioned sales of HOS and the Companys New York subsidiary will be used primarily for capital investment in the Regulated Businesses. The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. The termination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCCs revolving credit facility is March 21, 2025. The facility is used principally to support AWCCs commercial paper program, to provide additional liquidity support and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for letters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject to satisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, AWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, with $1.59 billion available to fulfill the Companys short-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company regularly evaluates the capital markets and closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions with contractual commitments in its revolving credit facility. Interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the LIBOR rate (or applicable market replacement rate) or base rate in accordance with Moody Investors Services and Standard & Poors Financial Services then applicable credit rating on AWCCs senior unsecured, non-credit enhanced debt.\nOn March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto (the Term Loan Facility). As of December 31, 2020, $500 million of principal was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility commitments terminated at maturity on March 19, 2021, and the Term Loan Facility was repaid in full. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at a variable annual rate based on LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.80%.\nShort-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $584 million and $786 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on AWCCs outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 0.25%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The weighted average interest rate on AWCCs outstanding short-term borrowings was 1.16%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, including $500 million of outstanding principal on the Term Loan Facility as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 there were no commercial paper or credit facility borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.\nPresented in the tables below is the aggregate credit facility commitments, commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility, as well as the available capacity for each, as of December 31:\nCommercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a)\n(In millions)\nTotal availability $ 2,100 $ 150 $ 2,250\nOutstanding debt (584) (76) (660)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2021 $ 1,516 $ 74 $ 1,590\n(a)Total remaining availability of $1.59 billion as of December 31, 2021 may be accessed through revolver draws.\nCommercial Paper Limit Letters of Credit Total (a)\n(In millions)\nTotal availability $ 2,100 $ 150 $ 2,250\nOutstanding debt (786) (76) (862)\nRemaining availability as of December 31, 2020 $ 1,314 $ 74 $ 1,388\n(a)Total remaining availability may be accessed through revolver draws.\nPresented in the table below is the Companys total available liquidity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively:\nCash and Cash Equivalents Availability on Revolving Credit Facility Total Available Liquidity\n(In millions)\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2021 $ 116 $ 1,590 $ 1,706\nAvailable liquidity as of December 31, 2020 $ 547 $ 1,388 $ 1,935\nPresented in the table below is the short-term borrowing activity for AWCC for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020\nAverage borrowings $ 910 $ 1,047\nMaximum borrowings outstanding 1,647 2,172\nWeighted average interest rates, computed on daily basis 0.25 % 1.16 %\nWeighted average interest rates, as of December 31 0.20 % 0.53 %\nThe changes in average borrowings between periods were mainly attributable to the $500 million borrowed under the Term Loan Facility during 2020, which terminated and was repaid in full at maturity on March 19, 2021.\nThe credit facility requires the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 0.70 to 1.00. The ratio as of December 31, 2021 was 0.60 to 1.00.\nNone of the Companys borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of securities, although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under AWCCs revolving credit facility.\nNote 14: General Taxes\nPresented in the table below is the components of general tax expense for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nProperty and capital stock $ 149 $ 140 $ 124\nGross receipts and franchise 121 116 110\nPayroll 39 36 35\nOther general 12 11 11\nTotal general taxes $ 321 $ 303 $ 280\nNote 15: Income Taxes\nPresented in the table below is the components of income tax expense for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nCurrent income taxes:\nState $ 72 $ 8 $ 4\nFederal 75 - -\nTotal current income taxes $ 147 $ 8 $ 4\nDeferred income taxes:\nState $ 10 $ 49 $ 54\nFederal 221 159 155\nAmortization of deferred investment tax credits (1) (1) (1)\nTotal deferred income taxes 230 207 208\nProvision for income taxes $ 377 $ 215 $ 212\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nIncome tax at statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nIncreases (decreases) resulting from:\nState taxes, net of federal taxes 3.9 % 4.8 % 5.4 %\nEADIT (3.6) % (2.1) % (0.9) %\nTax impact due to the sale of HOS 1.6 % - % - %\nOther, net 0.1 % (0.4) % (0.1) %\nEffective tax rate 23.0 % 23.3 % 25.4 %\nPresented in the table below are the components of the net deferred tax liability as of December 31:\n2021 2020\nDeferred tax assets:\nAdvances and contributions $ 439 $ 424\nTax losses and credits 10 65\nRegulatory income tax assets 301 329\nPension and other postretirement benefits 50 100\nOther 144 165\nTotal deferred tax assets 944 1,083\nValuation allowance (10) (19)\nTotal deferred tax assets, net of allowance $ 934 $ 1,064\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, plant and equipment $ 3,087 $ 2,913\nDeferred pension and other postretirement benefits 69 97\nOther 180 216\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 3,336 3,226\nLess: Deferred tax liabilities included in liabilities related to assets held for sale (a)\n- 69\nTotal deferred tax liabilities, net of deferred tax assets $ (2,402) $ (2,093)\n(a)These deferred tax liabilities are related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nThe Company recognized no federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards as of December 31, 2021 and $366 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company fully utilized its federal NOL carryforwards in 2021 due to the sale of HOS, and therefore, no valuation allowance is required.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had state NOLs of $123 million and $357 million, respectively, a portion of which are offset by a valuation allowance as the Company does not believe these NOLs are more likely than not to be realized. The state NOL carryforwards expire in 2021 through 2041.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or before 2012. The Company has state income tax examinations in progress and does not expect material adjustments to result.\nPresented in the table below are the changes in gross liability, excluding interest and penalties, for unrecognized tax benefits:\nAmount\nBalance as of January 1, 2020 $ 110\nIncreases in current period tax positions 18\nDecreases in prior period measurement of tax positions (6)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 122\nIncreases in current period tax positions 23\nDecreases in prior period measurement of tax positions (5)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 140\nThe Companys tax positions relate primarily to the deductions claimed for repair and maintenance costs on its utility plant. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its unrecognized tax benefits within the next year. As discussed above, the Company utilized its remaining federal NOLs in 2021, and therefore this federal tax attribute will not be available to reduce the federal liabilities for uncertain tax positions or interest accrued as presented on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf the Company sustains all of its positions as of December 31, 2021, an unrecognized tax benefit of $10 million, excluding interest and penalties, would impact the Companys effective tax rate. The Company had an insignificant amount of interest and penalties related to its tax positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nPresented in the table below are the changes in the valuation allowance:\nAmount\nBalance as of January 1, 2019 $ 14\nIncreases in current period tax positions 7\nBalance as of December 31, 2019 $ 21\nDecreases in current period tax positions (2)\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 19\nDecreases in current period tax positions (9)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 10\nNote 16: Employee Benefits\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations. Benefits under the plans are based on the employees years of service and compensation. The pension plans have been closed for all new employees. The pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001, except for specific eligible groups specified in the plan, had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement. Union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006 are provided with a 5.25% of base pay defined contribution plan. The Company does not participate in a multi-employer plan. The Company also has unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees.\nThe Companys pension funding practice is to contribute at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or the normal cost. Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid at risk status and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). The Company may also consider increased contributions, based on other financial requirements and the plans funded position. Pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates charged for utility services as contributions are made to the plans. See Note 4-Regulatory Matters for additional information. Pension plan assets are invested in a number of actively managed, commingled funds, and limited partnerships including equities, fixed income securities, guaranteed annuity contracts with insurance companies, real estate funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\nThe Company maintains other postretirement benefit plans providing varying levels of medical and life insurance to eligible retirees. The retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The plans had previously closed for non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2002. The Companys policy is to fund other postretirement benefit costs up to the amount recoverable through rates. Assets of the plans are invested in a number of actively managed funds in the form of separate accounts, commingled funds and limited partnerships, including equities and fixed income securities.\nThe investment policy guideline of the pension plan is focused on diversification, improving returns and reducing the volatility of the funded status over a long-term horizon. The investment policy guidelines of the postretirement plans focus on the appropriate strategy given the funded status of the plans. None of the Companys securities are included in pension or other postretirement benefit plan assets.\nThe Company uses fair value for all classes of assets in the calculation of market-related value of plan assets. As of 2018, the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets include the American Water Pension Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, and the Shorelands Water Company, Inc. Pension Plan.\nAs a result of the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, there will be a transfer of assets from two pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans from the Company to Liberty. The Company does not expect the assets to be transferred to be a significant percentage of the Companys overall pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nPresented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, by asset category:\nAsset Category 2022 Target Allocation Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2021\nCash $ 54 $ 54 $ - $ - 3 %\nEquity securities: 50 %\nU.S. large cap 217 217 - - 11 %\nU.S. small cap 113 113 - - 6 %\nInternational 516 7 354 155 26 %\nReal estate fund 141 - - 141 7 %\nREITs 9 - 9 - - %\nFixed income securities: 50 %\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 256 249 7 - 13 %\nCorporate bonds 601 - 601 - 30 %\nMortgage-backed securities 9 - 9 - - %\nMunicipal bonds 25 - 25 - 1 %\nTreasury futures - - - - - %\nLong duration bond fund 10 7 3 - 1 %\nGuarantee annuity contracts 40 - - 40 2 %\nTotal 100 % $ 1,991 $ 647 $ 1,008 $ 336 100 %\nAsset Category 2021 Target Allocation Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2020\nCash $ 78 $ 78 $ - $ - 4 %\nEquity securities: 50 %\nU.S. large cap 420 420 - - 21 %\nU.S. small cap 124 124 - - 6 %\nInternational 367 8 169 190 18 %\nReal estate fund 120 - - 120 6 %\nREITs 7 - 7 - - %\nFixed income securities: 50 %\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 171 163 8 - 9 %\nCorporate bonds 594 - 594 - 30 %\nMortgage-backed securities 9 - 9 - - %\nMunicipal bonds 34 - 34 - 2 %\nTreasury futures 10 10 - - 1 %\nLong duration bond fund 10 7 3 - 1 %\nGuarantee annuity contracts 46 - - 46 2 %\nTotal 100 % $ 1,990 $ 810 $ 824 $ 356 100 %\nPresented in the tables below are a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for 2021 and 2020, respectively:\nLevel 3\nBalance as of January 1, 2021 $ 356\nActual return on assets 41\nPurchases, issuances and settlements, net (61)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 336\nLevel 3\nBalance as of January 1, 2020 $ 349\nActual return on assets 3\nPurchases, issuances and settlements, net 4\nBalance as of December 31, 2020 $ 356\nThe Companys postretirement benefit plans have different levels of funded status and the assets are held under various trusts. The investments and risk mitigation strategies for the plans are tailored specifically for each trust. In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the selected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates the long-term, strategic asset allocations for these plans through asset liability studies and uses various analytics to determine the optimal asset allocation. Considerations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.\nIn 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over funded postretirement medical benefits bargaining plan. As a result of the change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability.\nThe Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixed income, equity, alternatives) or strategy for which they have been appointed. Investment management agreements and recurring performance and attribution analysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to adjust portfolio duration to align with a plans targeted investment policy.\nIn order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed to interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities. Conversely, rate decreases will increase fixed income assets, partially offsetting the related increase in the liabilities. Within equities, risk is mitigated by constructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirement medical bargaining plan, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plans exposure to changes in interest rates.\nActual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if necessary. Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) Trust assets include the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the New York Water Service Corporation Postretirement Medical Benefits Bargaining Plan, the American Water Postretirement Medical Benefits Non-Bargaining Plan, and the American Water Life Insurance Trust.\nPresented in the tables below are the fair values and asset allocations of the postretirement benefit plan assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, by asset category:\nAsset Category 2022 Target Allocation Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Percentage of Plan Assets as of December 31, 2021\nBargain VEBA:\nCash $ 10 $ 10 $ - $ - 3 %\nEquity securities: 4 %\nU.S. large cap 18 18 - - 5 %\nInternational 1 1 - - - %\nFixed income securities: 96 %\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 363 279 84 - 91 %\nLong duration bond fund 5 5 - - 1 %\nTotal bargain VEBA 100 % $ 397 $ 313 $ 84 $ - 100 %\nNon-bargain VEBA:\nCash $ 2 $ 2 $ - $ - -\nEquity securities: 60 %\nU.S. large cap 54 54 - - 39 %\nInternational 35 35 - - 25 %\nFixed income securities: 40 %\nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n49 - 49 - 36 %\nTotal non-bargain VEBA 100 % $ 140 $ 91 $ 49 $ - 100 %\nLife VEBA:\nCash $ 1 $ 1 $ - $ - 100 %\nEquity securities: 70 %\nU.S. large cap - - - - - %\nFixed income securities: 30 %\nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n- - - - - %\nTotal life VEBA 100 % $ 1 $ 1 $ - $ - 100 %\nTotal 100 % $ 538 $ 405 $ 133 $ - 100 %\n(a)Includes cash for margin requirements.\nAsset Category 2021 Target Allocation Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Percentage of Plan Assets as of 12/31/2020\nBargain VEBA:\nCash $ 12 $ 12 $ - $ - 3 %\nEquity securities: 4 %\nU.S. large cap 14 14 - - 3 %\nFixed income securities: 96 %\nU.S. Treasury securities and government bonds 389 308 81 - 93 %\nLong duration bond fund 5 5 - - 1 %\nTotal bargain VEBA 100 % $ 420 $ 339 $ 81 $ - 100 %\nNon-bargain VEBA:\nCash $ 1 $ 1 $ - $ - -\nEquity securities: 60 %\nU.S. large cap 51 51 - - 38 %\nInternational 33 33 - - 24 %\nFixed income securities: 40 %\nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n50 - 50 - 38 %\nTotal non-bargain VEBA 100 % $ 135 $ 85 $ 50 $ - 100 %\nLife VEBA:\nEquity securities: 70 %\nU.S. large cap $ - $ - $ - $ - - %\nFixed income securities: 30 %\nCore fixed income bond fund (a)\n1 1 - - 100 %\nTotal life VEBA 100 % $ 1 $ 1 $ - $ - 100 %\nTotal 100 % $ 556 $ 425 $ 131 $ - 100 %\n(a)Includes cash for margin requirements.\nValuation Techniques Used to Determine Fair Value\nCash-Cash and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased, including certain short-term fixed-income securities, are considered cash and are included in the recurring fair value measurements hierarchy as Level 1.\nEquity securities-For equity securities, the trustees obtain prices from pricing services, whose prices are obtained from direct feeds from market exchanges, that the Company is able to independently corroborate. Certain equity securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and categorized as Level 1. Other equities, such as international securities held in the pension plan, are invested in commingled funds and/or limited partnerships. These funds are valued to reflect the plan funds interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since net asset value is not directly observable or not available on a nationally recognized securities exchange for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2. For limited partnerships, the assets as a whole are categorized as Level 3 due to the fact that the partnership provides the pricing and the pricing inputs are less readily observable. In addition, the limited partnership vehicle cannot be readily traded.\nFixed-income securities-The majority of U.S. Treasury securities and government bonds have been categorized as Level 1 because they trade in highly-liquid and transparent markets and their prices can be corroborated. The fair values of corporate bonds, mortgage backed securities, and certain government bonds are based on prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities. They are categorized as Level 2 because the valuations are calculated using models which utilize actively traded market data that the Company can corroborate. Exchange-traded options and futures, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and are classified as Level 1.\nReal estate fund-Real estate fund is categorized as Level 3 as the fund uses significant unobservable inputs for fair value measurement and the vehicle is in the form of a limited partnership.\nREITs-REITs are invested in commingled funds. Commingled funds are valued to reflect the plan funds interest in the fund based on the reported year-end net asset value. Since the net asset value is not directly observable for the commingled funds, they are categorized as Level 2.\nGuaranteed annuity contracts-Guaranteed annuity contracts are categorized as Level 3 because the investments are not publicly quoted. Since these market values are determined by the provider, they are not highly observable and have been categorized as Level 3. Exchange-traded future and option positions are reported in accordance with changes in variation margins that are settled daily.\nPresented in the table below is a rollforward of the changes in the benefit obligation and plan assets for the two most recent years, for all plans combined:\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation as of January 1, $ 2,386 $ 2,161 $ 382 $ 374\nService cost 36 31 4 4\nInterest cost 64 73 10 12\nPlan participants' contributions - - 2 2\nPlan amendments - - - 5\nActuarial loss (gain) (46) 233 (26) 13\nSettlements (a)\n(6) (3) - -\nGross benefits paid (140) (109) (31) (29)\nFederal subsidy - - 1 1\nBenefit obligation as of December 31, $ 2,294 $ 2,386 $ 342 $ 382\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets as of January 1, $ 1,990 $ 1,747 $ 556 $ 532\nActual return on plan assets 108 314 9 53\nEmployer contributions 39 41 1 (2)\nPlan participants' contributions - - 2 2\nSettlements (a)\n(6) (3) - -\nBenefits paid (140) (109) (30) (29)\nFair value of plan assets as of December 31, $ 1,991 $ 1,990 $ 538 $ 556\nFunded value as of December 31, $ (303) $ (396) $ 196 $ 174\nAmounts recognized on the balance sheet:\nNoncurrent asset $ - $ - $ 193 $ 173\nCurrent liability (2) (2) - -\nNoncurrent liability (285) (388) (1) (1)\n(Liabilities) assets related to assets held for sale (b)\n(16) (6) 4 2\nNet amount recognized $ (303) $ (396) $ 196 $ 174\n(a)The Company paid $6 million and $3 million of lump sum payment distributions from the Companys New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)These balances are related to the sale of the Companys New York subsidiary, which was completed on January 1, 2022, and are included in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 6-Acquisitions and Divestitures for additional information.\nPresented in the table below are the components of accumulated other comprehensive income and regulatory assets that have not been recognized as components of periodic benefit costs as of December 31:\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nNet actuarial loss $ 381 $ 436 $ 35 $ 49\nPrior service credit (14) (16) (186) (217)\nNet amount recognized $ 367 $ 420 $ (151) $ (168)\nRegulatory assets (liabilities) $ 317 $ 366 $ (151) $ (168)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 50 54 - -\nTotal $ 367 $ 420 $ (151) $ (168)\nPresented in the tables below are the projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with a projected obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nProjected Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets\n2021 2020\nProjected benefit obligation $ 2,294 $ 2,386\nFair value of plan assets 1,991 1,990\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation Exceeds the Fair Value of Plans' Assets\n2021 2020\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 2,138 $ 2,188\nFair value of plan assets 1,991 1,990\nThe accumulated postretirement plan assets exceed benefit obligations for all of the Companys other postretirement benefit plans, except for the Northern Illinois Retiree Welfare Plan.\nIn 2006, the PPA replaced the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by requiring that defined benefit plans contribute to 100% of the current liability funding target over seven years. Defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the current liability are defined as being at risk and additional funding requirements and benefit restrictions may apply. The PPA was effective for the 2008 plan year with short-term phase-in provisions for both the funding target and at-risk determination. The Companys qualified defined benefit plan is currently funded above the at-risk threshold, and therefore the Company expects that the plans will not be subject to the at risk funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plans funded status and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.\nMinimum funding requirements for the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined by government regulations and not by accounting pronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2022 to the qualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.\nPresented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n2022 expected employer contributions:\nTo plan trusts $ 38 $ -\nTo plan participants 2 -\nPresented in the table below are the net benefits expected to be paid from the plan assets or the Companys assets:\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\nExpected Benefit Payments Expected Benefit Payments Expected Federal Subsidy Payments\n2022 $ 130 $ 26 $ 1\n2023 133 25 1\n2024 134 25 1\n2025 137 25 1\n2026 138 25 1\n2027-2031 688 113 3\nBecause the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, the rate of future compensation increases received by the Companys employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs. Each assumption is reviewed annually. The assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes.\nPresented in the table below are the significant assumptions related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans:\nPension Benefits Other Benefits\n2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine December 31 benefit obligations:\nDiscount rate 2.94% 2.74% 3.44% 2.90% 2.56% 3.36%\nRate of compensation increase 3.51% 3.51% 2.97% N/A N/A N/A\nMedical trend N/A N/A N/A graded from graded from graded from\n6.00% in 2022\n6.25% in 2021\n6.50% in 2020\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost:\nDiscount rate 2.74% 3.44% 4.38% 2.56% 3.36% 4.32%\nExpected return on plan assets 6.50% 6.50% 6.20% 3.67% 3.68% 3.56%\nRate of compensation increase 3.51% 2.97% 3.00% N/A N/A N/A\nMedical trend N/A N/A N/A graded from graded from graded from\n6.25% in 2021\n6.50% in 2020\n6.75% in 2019\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nto 5.00% in 2026+\nNOTE N/A in the table above means assumption is not applicable.\nThe discount rate assumption was determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently. The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans expected cash flows by matching the plans cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds. Historically, for each plan, the discount rate was developed at the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return, prior to administrative and investment management fees, for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolios. Assumed projected rates of return for each of the plans projected asset classes were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes. Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio was developed, adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared to the benchmark returns. The Companys pension expense increases as the expected return on assets decreases. The Company used an expected return on plan assets of 6.50% to estimate its 2021 pension benefit costs, and an expected blended return based on weighted assets of 3.67% to estimate its 2021 other postretirement benefit costs.\nThe Company had previously adopted a mortality table based on the Society of Actuaries RP 2014 mortality table including a generational MP-2018 projection scale. In 2020, the Company adopted the Pri-2012 base mortality table and the new MP-2020 mortality improvement scale to replace the previous assumption. In 2021, the Company utilized the Pri-2012 base mortality table and the new MP-2021 mortality improvement scale to replace the previous assumption.\nPresented in the table below are the components of net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nComponents of net periodic pension benefit cost:\nService cost $ 36 $ 31 $ 28\nInterest cost 64 73 82\nExpected return on plan assets (126) (111) (91)\nAmortization of prior service (credit) cost (3) (3) (3)\nAmortization of actuarial loss 27 30 32\nSettlements (a)\n- 1 -\nNet periodic pension benefit cost $ (2) $ 21 $ 48\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income:\nCurrent year actuarial loss (gain) $ 1 $ 12 $ (8)\nAmortization of actuarial loss (4) (3) (4)\nTotal recognized in other comprehensive income (3) 9 (12)\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive income $ (5) $ 30 $ 36\nComponents of net periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost:\nService cost $ 4 $ 4 $ 4\nInterest cost 10 12 15\nExpected return on plan assets (21) (19) (18)\nAmortization of prior service credit (32) (34) (35)\nAmortization of actuarial loss - 2 3\nNet periodic other postretirement benefit (credit) cost $ (39) $ (35) $ (31)\n(a)Due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the Companys New York Water Service Corporation Pension Plan, settlement charges of less than $1 million were recorded for both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. In accordance with existing regulatory accounting treatment, the Company has maintained the settlement charges in regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount is being amortized in accordance with existing regulatory practice.\nThe Companys policy is to recognize curtailments when the total expected future service of plan participants is reduced by greater than 10% due to an event that results in terminations and/or retirements.\nCumulative gains and losses that are in excess of 10% of the greater of either the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining future service of the current active membership for the plans.\nSavings Plans for Employees\nThe Company maintains 401(k) savings plans that allow employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis. Employees can make contributions that are invested at their direction in one or more funds. The Company makes matching contributions based on a percentage of an employees contribution, subject to certain limitations. Due to the Companys discontinuing new entrants into the defined benefit pension plan, on January 1, 2006, the Company began providing an additional 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit for union employees hired on or after January 1, 2001 and non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2006. The Companys 401(k) savings plan expenses totaled $14 million, $12 million and $12 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additionally, the Companys 5.25% of base pay defined contribution benefit expenses totaled $16 million, $15 million and $13 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. All of the Companys contributions are invested in one or more funds at the direction of the employees.\nNote 17: Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments have been made in connection with certain construction programs. The estimated capital expenditures required under legal and binding contractual obligations amounted to $626 million as of December 31, 2021.\nIn December 2021, the Company authorized the contribution of $45 million to the American Water Charitable Foundation, which was subsequently paid in January 2022.\nThe Companys regulated subsidiaries maintain agreements with other water purveyors for the purchase of water to supplement their water supply. Presented in the table below are the future annual commitments related to minimum quantities of purchased water having non-cancelable contracts:\nAmount\n2022 $ 71\n2023 65\n2024 51\n2025 49\n2026 49\nThereafter 507\nThe Company enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and other customers. See Note 5-Revenue Recognition for additional information regarding the Companys performance obligations.\nContingencies\nThe Company is routinely involved in legal actions incident to the normal conduct of its business. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has accrued approximately $7 million of probable loss contingencies and has estimated that the maximum amount of losses associated with reasonably possible loss contingencies that can be reasonably estimated is $2 million. For certain matters, claims and actions, the Company is unable to estimate possible losses. The Company believes that damages or settlements, if any, recovered by plaintiffs in such matters, claims or actions, other than as described in this Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWest Virginia Elk River Freedom Industries Chemical Spill\nOn June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted final approval of a settlement class and global class action settlement (the Settlement) for all claims and potential claims by all class members (collectively, the West Virginia Plaintiffs) arising out of the January 2014 Freedom Industries, Inc. chemical spill in West Virginia. The effective date of the Settlement was July 16, 2018. Under the terms and conditions of the Settlement, the Companys West Virginia subsidiary (WVAWC) and certain other Company affiliated entities did not admit, and will not admit, any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the West Virginia Plaintiffs in any of the actions that were resolved.\nThe aggregate pre-tax amount contributed by WVAWC of the $126 million portion of the Settlement with respect to the Company, net of insurance recoveries, is $19 million. As of December 31, 2021, $0.5 million of the aggregate Settlement amount of $126 million has been reflected in accrued liabilities, and $0.5 million in offsetting insurance receivables have been reflected in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount reflected in accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2021 reflects reductions in the liability and appropriate reductions to the offsetting insurance receivable reflected in other current assets, associated with payments made to the Settlement fund, the receipt of a determination by the Settlement funds appeal adjudicator on all remaining medical claims and the calculation of remaining attorneys fees and claims administration costs. The Company funded WVAWCs contributions to the Settlement through existing sources of liquidity.\nDunbar, West Virginia Water Main Break Class Action Litigation\nOn the evening of June 23, 2015, a 36-inch pre-stressed concrete transmission water main, installed in the early 1970s, failed. The water main is part of the West Relay pumping station located in the City of Dunbar, West Virginia and owned by WVAWC. The failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure for up to approximately 25,000 WVAWC customers. In the early morning hours of June 25, 2015, crews completed a repair, but that same day, the repair developed a leak. On June 26, 2015, a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80% of the impacted customers, and to the remaining approximately 20% by the next morning. The second repair showed signs of leaking, but the water main was usable until June 29, 2015 to allow tanks to refill. The system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3,000 customers while a final repair was being completed safely on June 30, 2015. Water service was fully restored by July 1, 2015 to all customers affected by this event.\nOn June 2, 2017, a complaint captioned Jeffries, et al. v. West Virginia-American Water Company was filed in West Virginia Circuit Court in Kanawha County on behalf of an alleged class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the Dunbar main break. The complaint alleges breach of contract by WVAWC for failure to supply water, violation of West Virginia law regarding the sufficiency of WVAWCs facilities and negligence by WVAWC in the design, maintenance and operation of the water system. The Jeffries plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits, annoyance and inconvenience, and loss of use, as well as punitive damages for willful, reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage.\nIn February 2020, the Jeffries plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification on the issues of breach of contract and negligence, and to determine the applicability of punitive damages and a multiplier for those damages if imposed. In July 2020, the Circuit Court entered an order granting the Jeffries plaintiffs motion for certification of a class regarding certain liability issues but denying certification of a class to determine a punitive damages multiplier. In August 2020, WVAWC filed a Petition for Writ of Prohibition in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia seeking to vacate or remand the Circuit Courts order certifying the issues class. On January 28, 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeals remanded the case back to the Circuit Court for further consideration in light of a decision issued in another case relating to the class certification issues raised on appeal. On July 16, 2021, oral argument was heard by the Circuit Court on the issue of addressing the Supreme Court of Appeals remand. This matter remains pending.\nThe Company and WVAWC believe that WVAWC has valid, meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint. WVAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.\nChattanooga, Tennessee Water Main Break Class Action Litigation\nOn September 12, 2019, the Companys Tennessee subsidiary (TAWC), experienced a leak in a 36-inch water transmission main, which caused service fluctuations or interruptions to TAWC customers and the issuance of a boil water notice. TAWC repaired the main by early morning on September 14, 2019, and restored full water service by the afternoon of September 15, 2019, with the boil water notice lifted for all customers on September 16, 2019.\nOn September 17, 2019, a complaint captioned Bruce, et al. v. American Water Works Company, Inc., et al. was filed in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee against TAWC, the Company and American Water Works Service Company, Inc. (Service Company and, together with TAWC and the Company, collectively, the Tennessee-American Water Defendants), on behalf of a proposed class of individuals or entities who lost water service or suffered monetary losses as a result of the Chattanooga incident (the Tennessee Plaintiffs). The complaint alleged breach of contract and negligence against the Tennessee-American Water Defendants, as well as an equitable remedy of piercing the corporate veil. In the complaint as originally filed, the Tennessee Plaintiffs were seeking an award of unspecified alleged damages for wage losses, business and economic losses, out-of-pocket expenses, loss of use and enjoyment of property and annoyance and inconvenience, as well as punitive damages, attorneys fees and pre- and post-judgment interest. In September 2020, the court dismissed all of the Tennessee Plaintiffs claims in their complaint, except for the breach of contract claims against TAWC, which remain pending. In October 2020, TAWC answered the complaint, and the parties have been engaging in discovery. The court has entered an agreed scheduling order, which sets a hearing in October 2022 to address the question of class certification.\nTAWC and the Company believe that TAWC has meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint, and TAWC is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. The Company cannot currently determine the likelihood of a loss, if any, or estimate the amount of any loss or a range of such losses related to this proceeding.\nAlternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions\nCompliance with Orders to Reduce Carmel River Diversions-Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project\nUnder a 2009 order (the 2009 Order) of the State Water Resources Control Board (the SWRCB), the Companys California subsidiary (Cal Am) is required to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the Carmel River according to a set reduction schedule. In 2016, the SWRCB issued an order (the 2016 Order) approving a deadline of December 31, 2021 for Cal Ams compliance with these prior orders.\nCal Am is currently involved in developing the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the Water Supply Project), which includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by Cal Am, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes Cal Ams purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the GWR Project) between Monterey One Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the MPWMD). The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill Cal Ams obligations under the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.\nCal Ams ability to move forward on the Water Supply Project is subject to administrative review by the CPUC and other government agencies, obtaining necessary permits, and intervention from other parties. In September 2016, the CPUC unanimously approved a final decision to authorize Cal Am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the GWR Project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to $50 million in associated incurred costs plus AFUDC, subject to meeting certain criteria.\nIn September 2018, the CPUC unanimously approved another final decision finding that the Water Supply Project meets the CPUCs requirements for a certificate of public convenience and necessity and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects. The CPUCs 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Ams cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which amounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Ams actual financing costs. The 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of Cal Ams prudently incurred costs associated with the Water Supply Project upon its completion, subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps, operation and maintenance costs, financing, ratemaking and contingency matters. The reasonableness of the Water Supply Project costs will be reviewed by the CPUC when Cal Am seeks cost recovery for the Water Supply Project. Cal Am has incurred $186 million in aggregate costs as of December 31, 2021 related to the Water Supply Project, which includes $47 million in AFUDC.\nIn September 2021, Cal Am, Monterey One Water and the MPWMD reached an agreement on Cal Ams purchase of additional water from an expansion to the GWR Project, which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest. The amended and restated water purchase agreement for the GWR Project expansion is subject to review and approval of the CPUC, and on November 29, 2021, Cal Am filed an application with the CPUC seeking review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement. Cal Am is also requesting rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain Cal Am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the GWR Project and a related Aquifer Storage and Recovery Project, totaling approximately $81 million. This amount is in addition to, and consistent in regulatory treatment with, the prior $50 million of cost recovery for facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement, which was approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.\nWhile Cal Am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order, as well as the CPUCs 2016 and 2018 final decisions, Cal Am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the Water Supply Project and there can be no assurance that Cal Am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the $50 million in construction costs previously approved by the CPUC in its 2016 final decision.\nCoastal Development Permit Application\nIn June 2018, Cal Am submitted a coastal development permit application to the City of Marina (the City) for those project components of the Water Supply Project located within the Citys coastal zone. Members of the Citys Planning Commission, as well as City councilpersons, have publicly expressed opposition to the Water Supply Project. In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Ams coastal development permit application. Thereafter, Cal Am appealed this decision to the California Coastal Commission (the Coastal Commission), as permitted under the Citys code and the California Coastal Act. At the same time, Cal Am submitted an application to the Coastal Commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the Coastal Commissions original jurisdiction. In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a denial of Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its final decision approving the Water Supply Project. In November 2019, discussions between staffs of the Coastal Commission and the CPUC took place regarding the Coastal Commission staff recommendation, at which time the CPUC raised questions about the Coastal Commission staffs findings on water supply and demand, groundwater impacts and the viability of a project that the Coastal Commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the Water Supply Project.\nIn August 2020, the staff of the Coastal Commission released a report again recommending denial of Cal Ams application for a coastal development permit. Although the report concluded that the Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources, such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands, and that the Coastal Commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staffs report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern. In September 2020, Cal Am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staffs environmental justice concerns. The withdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Ams appeal of the Citys denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. Cal Am refiled the original jurisdiction application in November 2020. In December 2020, the Coastal Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incomplete application, identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete. In March 2021, Cal Am provided responses to the Coastal Commissions notice of incomplete application. On June 18, 2021, the Coastal Commission responded, acknowledging the responses and requesting certain additional information before the application could be considered complete. Cal Am responded with the requested additional information on January 11, 2022, and on February 8, 2022, the Coastal Commission requested additional information. The original jurisdiction application remains pending.\nCal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the Water Supply Project. However, there can be no assurance that the Water Supply Project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis, if ever. Beginning in January 2022, Cal Am expects to be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements contained in the 2016 Order, but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years will depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand. The 2009 Order and the 2016 Order remain in effect until Cal Am certifies to the SWRCB, and the SWRCB concurs, that Cal Am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized Carmel River diversions. While the Company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters, further attempts to comply with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order may result in material additional costs and obligations to Cal Am, including fines and penalties against Cal Am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 Order and the 2016 Order.\nNote 18: Earnings per Common Share\nPresented in the table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for the basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations for the years ended December 31:\n2021 2020 2019\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to common shareholders $ 1,263 $ 709 $ 621\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding-Basic 182 181 181\nEffect of dilutive common stock equivalents - 1 -\nWeighted average common shares outstanding-Diluted 182 182 181\nThe effect of dilutive common stock equivalents is related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and PSUs granted under the Companys 2007 Plan and outstanding RSUs and PSUs granted under the Companys 2017 Omnibus Plan, as well as estimated shares to be purchased under the ESPP. Less than one million share-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method.\nNote 19: Fair Value of Financial Information\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:\nCurrent assets and current liabilities-The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for current assets and current liabilities, including revolving credit debt, due to the short-term maturities and variable interest rates, approximate their fair values.\nSeller promissory note from the sale of HOS - The carrying amount reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the seller promissory note from the sale of HOS approximates fair value.\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt-The fair values of preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements and long-term debt are categorized within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs that are used to value each instrument. The fair value of long-term debt classified as Level 1 is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 instruments are valued using observable inputs and Level 3 instruments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs.\nPresented in the tables below are the carrying amounts, including fair value adjustments previously recognized in acquisition purchase accounting, and the fair values of the Companys financial instruments:\nAs of December 31, 2021\nCarrying Amount At Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2 Level 3 Total\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements $ 4 $ - $ - $ 6 $ 6\nLong-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) 10,396 10,121 60 1,637 11,818\nAs of December 31, 2020\nCarrying Amount At Fair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2 Level 3 Total\nPreferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements $ 5 $ - $ - $ 7 $ 7\nLong-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) 9,656 9,639 415 1,753 11,807\nFair Value Measurements\nTo increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access as of the reporting date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange-based derivatives, mutual funds and money market funds.\nLevel 2-Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, non-exchange-based derivatives, commingled investment funds not subject to purchase and sale restrictions and fair-value hedges.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs, such as internally-developed pricing models for the asset or liability due to little or no market activity for the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based derivatives and commingled investment funds subject to purchase and sale restrictions.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nPresented in the tables below are assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy:\nAs of December 31, 2021\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nRestricted funds $ 21 $ - $ - $ 21\nRabbi trust investments 23 - - 23\nDeposits 27 - - 27\nOther investments 17 - - 17\nContingent cash payment from the sale of HOS - - 72 72\nTotal assets 88 - 72 160\nLiabilities:\nDeferred compensation obligations 27 - - 27\nTotal liabilities 27 - - 27\nTotal assets $ 61 $ - $ 72 $ 133\nAs of December 31, 2020\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nRestricted funds $ 29 $ - $ - $ 29\nRabbi trust investments 19 - - 19\nDeposits 4 - - 4\nOther investments 11 - - 11\nTotal assets 63 - - 63\nLiabilities:\nDeferred compensation obligations 24 - - 24\nTotal liabilities 24 - - 24\nTotal assets $ 39 $ - $ - $ 39\nRestricted funds-The Companys restricted funds primarily represent proceeds received from financings for the construction and capital improvement of facilities and from customers for future services under operation, maintenance and repair projects.\nRabbi trust investments-The Companys rabbi trust investments consist of equity and index funds from which supplemental executive retirement plan benefits and deferred compensation obligations can be paid. The Company includes these assets in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeposits-Deposits include escrow funds and certain other deposits held in trust. The Company includes cash deposits in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred compensation obligations-The Companys deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional investment accounts. The Company includes such plans in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The value of the Companys deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants notional investment accounts. The notional investments are comprised primarily of mutual funds, which are based on observable market prices.\nMark-to-market derivative assets and liabilities - The Company employs derivative financial instruments in the form of variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements, classified as economic hedges and cash flow hedges, respectively, in order to fix the interest cost on existing or forecasted debt. The Company may use fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps, typically designated as fair-value hedges, to achieve a targeted level of variable-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. The Company uses a calculation of future cash inflows and estimated future outflows, which are discounted, to determine the current fair value. Additional inputs to the present value calculation include the contract terms, counterparty credit risk, interest rates and market volatility. The Company had no significant mark-to-market derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nOther investments-Other investments primarily represent money market funds used for active employee benefits. The Company includes other investments in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContingent cash payment from the sale of HOS - The Companys contingent cash payment derivative included as part of the consideration from the sale of HOS is included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the contingent cash payment is estimated using the probability of the outcome of receipt of the $75 million, a Level 3 input.\nNote 20: Leases\nThe Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. Certain operating leases have renewal options ranging from one to 60 years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Companys sole discretion. Renewal options that the Company was reasonably certain to exercise are included in the Companys ROU assets. Certain operating leases contain the option to purchase the leased property. The operating leases for real property, vehicles and equipment will expire over the next 38 years, five years, and five years, respectively.\nThe Company participates in a number of arrangements with various public entities (Partners) in West Virginia. Under these arrangements, the Company transferred a portion of its utility plant to the Partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of Industrial Development Bonds (IDBs) issued by the Partners under the Industrial Development and Commercial Development Bond Act. The Company leased back the utility plant under agreements for a period of 30 to 40 years. The Company has recorded these agreements as finance leases in property, plant and equipment, as ownership of the assets will revert back to the Company at the end of the lease term. The carrying value of the finance lease assets was $146 million and $147 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company determined that the finance lease obligations and the investments in IDBs meet the conditions for offsetting, and as such, are reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and excluded from the finance lease disclosure presented below.\nThe Company also enters into O&M agreements with the Partners. The Company pays an annual fee for use of the Partners assets in performing under the O&M agreements. The O&M agreements are recorded as operating leases, and future annual use fees of $4 million in 2022 through 2026, and $48 million thereafter, are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRental expenses under operating and finance leases were $13 million, $14 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash paid for amounts in lease liabilities, which includes operating and financing cash flows from operating and finance leases, was $13 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities was $11 million.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term of the finance lease and operating leases were four years and 18 years, respectively, and the weighted-average discount rate of the finance lease and operating leases were 12% and 4%, respectively.\nThe future maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 are $12 million in 2022, $9 million in 2023, $9 million in 2024, $8 million in 2025, $7 million in 2026 and $89 million thereafter. At December 31, 2021 imputed interest was $45 million.\nNote 21: Segment Information\nThe Companys operating segments are comprised of the revenue-generating components of its businesses for which separate financial information is internally produced and regularly used by management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. The Company operates its businesses primarily through one reportable segment, the Regulated Businesses segment. The Company also operates market-based businesses that, individually, do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with GAAP, and are collectively presented as the Market-Based Businesses.\nThe Regulated Businesses segment is the largest component of the Companys business and includes subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 14 states.\nThe Companys primary Market-Based Businesses include MSG, which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations, and the Companys former HOS business, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2021, and previously provided various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies. The Regulated Businesses segment and Market-Based Businesses include intercompany costs that are allocated by Service Company and intercompany interest that is charged by AWCC, both of which are eliminated to reconcile to the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inter-segment revenues include the sale of water from a regulated subsidiary to market-based subsidiaries, leased office space, and furniture and equipment provided by the market-based subsidiaries to regulated subsidiaries. Other includes corporate costs that are not allocated to the Companys operating segments, eliminations of inter-segment transactions, fair value adjustments, and associated income and deductions related to the acquisitions that have not been allocated to the operating segments for evaluation of performance and allocation of resource purposes. The adjustments related to the acquisitions are reported in Other as they are excluded from segment performance measures evaluated by management.\nPresented in the tables below is summarized segment information as of and for the years ended December 31:\nRegulated\nBusinesses Market-Based Businesses Other Consolidated\nOperating revenues $ 3,384 $ 563 $ (17) $ 3,930\nDepreciation and amortization 601 22 13 636\nTotal operating expenses, net 2,227 510 (3) 2,734\nInterest expense (290) (7) (106) (403)\nInterest income 1 3 - 4\nGain or (loss) on sale of businesses (1) 748 - 747\nIncome before income taxes 962 798 (120) 1,640\nProvision for income taxes 172 248 (43) 377\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 789 550 (76) 1,263\nTotal assets 23,365 514 2,196 26,075\nCash paid for capital expenditures 1,747 8 9 1,764\nRegulated\nBusinesses Market-Based Businesses Other Consolidated\nOperating revenues $ 3,255 $ 540 $ (18) $ 3,777\nDepreciation and amortization 562 26 16 604\nTotal operating expenses, net 2,102 421 6 2,529\nInterest expense (293) (7) (97) (397)\nInterest income 2 8 (8) 2\nIncome before income taxes 932 120 (128) 924\nProvision for income taxes 217 29 (31) 215\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 715 91 (97) 709\nTotal assets 22,357 891 1,518 24,766\nCash paid for capital expenditures 1,804 10 8 1,822\nRegulated\nBusinesses Market-Based Businesses Other Consolidated\nOperating revenues $ 3,094 $ 539 $ (23) $ 3,610\nDepreciation and amortization 529 37 16 582\nTotal operating expenses, net 1,964 436 (4) 2,396\nInterest expense (299) (8) (79) (386)\nInterest income 4 13 (13) 4\nIncome before income taxes 869 66 (102) 833\nProvision for income taxes 215 20 (23) 212\nNet income attributable to common shareholders 654 46 (79) 621\nTotal assets 20,318 1,008 1,356 22,682\nCash paid for capital expenditures 1,627 13 14 1,654\nNote 22: Unaudited Quarterly Data\nPresented in the tables below are supplemental, unaudited, consolidated, quarterly financial data for each of the four quarters in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nBased on that evaluation, the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and its directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management, including the Companys President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2021, using the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on the Companys evaluation under the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), its management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during its last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III ITEM 10.
