<p align="center"><strong>PART I</strong></center></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Item 1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="ref1">
<strong>Business</strong></a>.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">(a)&nbsp;<u>General Development
of Business</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") is a grantor trust which, on behalf of the owners of
units of beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit owners"), holds
overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain
concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The rights
are held under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group").  Under
these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage royalties on
the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas involved.
At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well
gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur.  See Item 2 of
this annual report on Form 10-K (this "Report") for descriptions of the
relationships of these companies and certain of these contracts.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The royalty rights were
received by the Trust from North European Oil Company (the "Company")
upon dissolution of the Company in September 1975.  The Company was
organized in 1957 as the successor to North European Oil Corporation
(the "Corporation").  The Trust is administered by trustees (the
"Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement").</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Neither the Trust nor the
Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct any active business activities
or operations.  The function of the Trustees is to monitor, verify,
collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty payments made to the
Trust.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make quarterly
distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of
the unit owners.  Funds temporarily held by the Trust prior to their
distribution are invested in an interest bearing money market account.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">There has been no significant
change in the principal operation or purpose of the Trust during the
past fiscal year. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")
adopted rules implementing legislation concerning governance matters
for publicly held entities.  The Trust is complying with the
requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this time, the Trustees have
chosen not to request any relief from those provisions based on the
passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the future.  Accordingly,
the Trustees have directed that certain of the additional
statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference in
this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even
though such statements and disclosures might not now or in
the future be required to be made by the Trust.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">In addition, the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units of beneficial interest of
the Trust are listed for trading, has additional corporate governance
rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.
Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE are not
applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a
royalty trust and holding only overriding royalty rights.  The Trustees
have, however, chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a
Compensation Committee but may not necessarily continue to do so in
the future.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(b)&nbsp;<u>Narrative
Description of Business</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Trust Agreement,
the Trust conducts no active business operations and is restricted
to collection of income from royalty rights and distribution to unit
owners of the net income after payment of administrative and
related expenses.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The overriding royalty
rights held by the Trust are derived from contracts and agreements
originally entered into by German subsidiaries of the predecessor
Corporation during the early 1930s.  The Trust's primary royalty
rights are based on a government granted concession and remain in
effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or
exploration efforts within the concession.  It is generally
anticipated that production activities will continue as long as
they remain economically profitable.  The Trust holds other royalty
rights, which are based on
leases which have passed their original expiration dates.  These
leases remain in effect as long as there is continued production or
the lessor does not cancel the lease.  Individual lessors will
normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted
because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if
sales of oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased
land.  Additionally, termination by individual lessors would result
in the escheat of mineral rights to the applicable state.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Royalties are paid to the
Trust on sales from production under these leases and concessions on a
regular monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.
The Trust receives the royalty payments exclusively in Euros.  After
the royalties have been deposited in the Trust's account with
Deutsche Bank in Germany, sufficient funds are reserved to handle any
outstanding or anticipated expenses and maintain a minimal balance of
10,000 Euros.  The Trust then converts the remainder of Euro
denominated funds into United States ("U.S.") dollars based upon the
available exchange rates.  Following this
conversion to U.S. dollars, the royalties are transferred
to the Trust's bank account in the U.S.  The Trust does not engage in
activities to hedge against currency risk, and the fluctuations in the
conversion rate impact its financial results.  Since the
actual royalty deposits are held as Euros for such a limited time, the
market risk with respect to these deposits is small.  The Trust has not
experienced any difficulty in effecting the conversion of Euros into
U.S. dollars.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">As the holder of overriding
royalty rights, the Trust has no legal ability, whether by contract or
operation of law, to compel production or exploration.  Moreover, if
an operator should determine to terminate production in any concession
or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the royalty
rights for that area would thereby be terminated.  Under certain
royalty agreements, it is a requirement that the Trust be advised of
any intention to surrender lease or concession rights.  While the
Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,
possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a
surrendered concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party
operator to develop such concession or lease.  There is no assurance
that the Trust could find such a third party.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The exploration for and the
production of gas and oil is a speculative business.  The Trust has no
means of ensuring continued income from its royalty rights at either
their present levels or otherwise.  The Trust has no role in any of
the operating companies' decision-making processes, such as gas
pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact royalty income.
In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas and oil and
the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to the
Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately
projected.  Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.
While known reserves may increase as additional development adds
quantities to the reserve amount, the amount of known and unknown
reserves is finite and will decline over time.  Given these factors,
along with the uncertainty in worldwide and local German economic
conditions and the fact that the Trustees have no information
beyond that information which is generally available to the public,
the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">While Germany has laws
relating to environmental protection, the Trustees do not
have detailed information concerning the present or possible effect
of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds royalty
rights on production and sale of products from those areas.  The
Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on
July 8, 2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in
Germany permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth.  The law
requires that an environmental impact study be performed and that
permission by the relevant water authority be granted in order to
ensure the protection of drinking water supplies.  Based upon an
analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's German consultant
has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in all
current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession (as
defined below) both due
to the depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.
However, the operating companies would still have to comply with
all regulatory requirements governing the use of fracking. The
failure by the operating companies to comply with all regulatory
requirements could affect the volume of gas, sulfur and oil
production by the operating companies and could adversely affect
the royalties paid to the Trust.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust, in cooperation
with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian Universalist Congregation
at Shelter Rock)("UUCSR")), arranges for periodic examinations of
the books and records of the operating companies to verify
compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable
agreements.  As a cost savings measure, the royalty examination is
conducted on a biennial basis.  From time to time, these
examinations disclose computational errors or errors from
inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate
adjustments are requested to be made.  As a result of the
amendments to the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing
simplification (see Item 7 of this Report), examinations by the
Trust's German accountants have been simplified since these
examinations are primarily limited to the verification of the gas
quantities sold.  Although these periodic examinations may also
disclose other matters that are subject to dispute between the
parties, these disputes have historically been resolved through
negotiations without the need for litigation.  The Trust's
accountants in Germany will begin their examination of the
operating companies for calendar years 2021 and 2022 in November
2023 when the final sales figures and the German Border Import
gas Prices (see Item 7 of this Report) are both available.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(c)&nbsp;<u>Financial
Information about Geographic Areas</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Item 2 of this
Report, there is a schedule (by product, geographic area, and
operating company) showing the royalty income received by the Trust
during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">(d)&nbsp;<u>Information
about our Trustees and
Executive Officers</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;As specified in the
Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are managed by not more
than five individual Trustees who receive compensation determined
under that same agreement.  One of the Trustees is designated as
Managing Trustee.  Robert P. Adelman has served in a non-executive
capacity as Managing Trustee since November 1, 2006.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Ahron H. Haspel is
independent and has been determined to be a financial expert (both
as defined in the SEC rules).  Mr. Haspel serves as Chairman for
the Audit and Compensation Committees.  Lawrence A. Kobrin serves
as Clerk to the Trustees (a role similar to that of a corporate
secretary).  For these services, these three individuals receive
additional compensation.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Day-to-day matters are
handled by the Managing Director, John R. Van Kirk, who also serves
as CEO and CFO.  Mr. Van Kirk has held the position of
Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990.  As a cost
saving measure, the Trust shifted to a virtual office in fiscal
2019.  This shift has not impacted the operations or
administration of the Trust.  In addition to the Managing
Director, the Trust has one administrative employee in the U.S.,
whose title is Administrator.  The number of total employees of
the Trust is two, and the number of full-time employees is two.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust and UUCSR have
retained the services of a consultant, an accounting firm
and a legal firm in Germany.  The consultant has broad experience in
the petroleum industry and provides reports on a regular basis.  The
accounting firm and the legal firm advise and represent as needed.
The Trust and the co-royalty holder share the costs of these services
in Germany.</p>

<b>Properties</b>.</a></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The properties of the Trust,
which the Trust and Trustees hold pursuant to the Trust Agreement on
behalf of the unit owners, are overriding royalty rights on sales of
gas, sulfur and oil under a concession in the Federal Republic of
Germany (the "Oldenburg concession").  The Oldenburg concession covers
approximately 1,386,000 acres, is located in the German federal state
of Lower Saxony, and is the area from which natural gas, sulfur and oil
are extracted.  The Oldenburg concession currently provides nearly 100%
of all the royalties received by the Trust.  The Oldenburg concession
is held by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German operating
subsidiary of ExxonMobil, and by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft
("OEG").  As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil owns
two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies owns
one-third of OEG.  BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture
in which ExxonMobil and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50%,
administers the concession held by OEG.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and
BEB formed ExxonMobil Production Deutschland GmbH ("EMPG") to carry
out all exploration, drilling and production activities.  All sales
activities upon which the calculation of royalties is based are still
handled by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB (the "operating companies"). </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Under one set of rights
covering the western part of the Oldenburg concession (approximately
662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty payment of 4% on gross
receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement").  Under the Mobil
Agreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together account
for approximately 99% of all the royalties under said agreement.
Historically, the Trust has received significantly greater royalty
payments under the Mobil Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreement
described below) due to the higher royalty rate specified by that
agreement.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust is also entitled
under an agreement with Mobil Erdgas to receive a 2% royalty on gross
receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a by-product of sour gas
produced from the western part of Oldenburg (the "Mobil Sulfur
Agreement").  The payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned upon
sales of sulfur by Mobil Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed
upon base price.  This base price is adjusted annually by an
inflation index.  When the average quarterly selling price falls
below the indexed base price, no sulfur royalties are paid by Mobil
Erdgas.  Sulfur royalties under the Mobil Agreement totaled $316,527
and $178,367 during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Under another set of rights
covering the entire Oldenburg concession and pursuant to the agreement
with OEG, the Trust receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667% on gross
receipts from sales by BEB of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,
condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour gas) less
a certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG Agreement").  Under the
OEG Agreement, 50% of the field handling and treatment costs as
reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the gross sales
receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to the
Trust.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Exhibit 99.1 to this Report
is a report entitled Calculation of Cost Depletion Percentage for
the 2022 Calendar Year Based on the Estimate of Remaining Proved
Producing Reserves in the Northwest Basin of the Federal Republic of
Germany as of October 1, 2022 (the "Cost Depletion Report").  The
Cost Depletion Report, dated November 23, 2022, was prepared by
Graves & Co. Consulting, LLC, 2777 Allen Parkway, Suite 525,
Houston, Texas 77019 ("Graves & Co.").  Graves & Co. is an
independent petroleum and natural gas consulting organization
specialized in analyzing hydrocarbon reserves.
</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Cost Depletion Report
provides documentation supporting the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage for the 2022 calendar year based on the use of
certain production data and the estimated net proved producing
reserves as of October 1, 2022 for the primary area in which the
Trust holds overriding royalty rights.  In order to permit timely
filing of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practice
of the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared for
the 12-month period ended September 30, 2022.  While this is one
month prior to the end of the fiscal year of the Trust, the
information available for production and sales through the end of
September is the most complete information available at a date
early enough to permit the timely preparation of the various
reports required.  Unit owners are referred to the full text of the
Cost Depletion Report contained herein for further details.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The cost depletion percentage
is prepared by Graves & Co. for the Trust's unit owners for tax
reporting purposes.  The cost depletion percentage in that report for
calendar 2022 is 7.8894%.  Specific details relative to the Trust's
income and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply to
the calculation of taxable income for the 2022 calendar year are
included on removable pages in the 2022 Annual Report.  Additionally,
the tax reporting information for 2022 is available on the Trust's
website, http://www.neort.com/tax-letters.html.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The primary purpose of the
Cost Depletion Report is the preparation of the cost depletion
percentage for use by unit owners in their own tax reporting.  The
only information provided to the Trust that can be utilized in the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage is current and
historical production and sales of proved producing reserves.  For
the western half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
quarterly production and sales information on a well-by-well basis.
For the eastern half of the Oldenburg concession, the Trust receives
cumulative quarterly production and sales information on two general
areas.  These general areas encompass numerous fields with varying
numbers of wells.  Pursuant to the arrangements under which the
Trust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is not
considered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has no
access to the operating companies' proprietary information
concerning producing field reservoir data.  The Trustees have been
advised by their German counsel that publication of such information
is not required under applicable law in Germany and that the royalty
rights do not grant the Trust the right to require or compel the
release of such information.  Efforts to obtain such
information from the operating companies have not been successful.
The information made available to the Trust by the operating
companies does not include any of the following: reserve estimates,
capitalized costs, production cost estimates, revenue projections,
producing field reservoir data (including pressure data, permeability,
porosity and thickness of producing zone) or other similar
information.  While the limited information available to the Trust
permits the calculation of the cost depletion percentage, it does not
change the uncertainty with respect to the estimate of proved
producing reserves.  In addition, it is impossible for the Trust or
its consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probable
future net recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographic
areas.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust has the
authority to examine, but only for certain limited purposes, the
operating companies' sales and production from the royalty areas.
Both Graves & Co. and the Trustees believe the use of the material
available is appropriate and suitable for preparation of the cost
depletion percentage and the estimates described in the Cost Depletion
Report.  The Trustees and Graves & Co. believe this report and these
estimates to be reasonable and appropriate but assume that these
estimates may vary from statistical estimates which could be made
if complete reservoir production information were available.  The
limited information available makes it inappropriate to make
projections or estimates of proved or probable reserves of any
category or class other than the estimated net proved producing
reserves described in the Cost Depletion Report. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Attachment A of the Cost
Depletion Report shows a schedule of estimated net proved producing
reserves of the Trust's royalty properties, computed as of
October 1, 2022 and a five-year schedule of gas, sulfur and oil
sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, 2021, 2020,
2019 and 2018 computed from quarterly sales reports of operating
companies received by the Trust during such periods.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Executive Summary</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust is a passive fixed
investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights, receives
income under those rights from certain operating companies, pays
its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit
owners.  As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income
are made on a quarterly basis.  These distributions, as determined
by the Trustees, constitute substantially all the funds on hand
after provision is made for Trust expenses then anticipated.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust does not engage in
any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over
which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from engaging in such
activities by the Trust Agreement.  There are no requirements,
therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of
royalty revenues by the Trust.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The properties of the Trust
are described in Item 2. Properties of this Report.  Of particular
importance with respect to royalty income are the two royalty
agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement.  The Mobil
Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg
concession. The Trust has traditionally received the majority of its
royalty income under the Mobil Agreement due to the higher
royalty rate of 4%.  The OEG Agreement covers gas sales from
the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of 0.6667% is
significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly
lower.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The operating companies pay
royalties to the Trust based on their sales of natural gas,
sulfur and oil.  Of these three products, natural gas provided
approximately 95% of the total royalties in fiscal 2022.  The amount
of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:
the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which
the gas is sold and the exchange rate.  For purposes of the royalty
calculations, the determination of the gas price is explained in
detail in the following three paragraphs.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">On August 26, 2016, the
Mobil and OEG Agreements were amended to establish a new base to
determine gas prices for the calculation of the Trust's royalties.
This new base is set as the state assessment base for natural gas
used by the operating companies in their calculation of royalties
payable to the State of Lower Saxony.  This change reflects a shift
to the prices calculated for the German Border Import gas Price
("GBIP").  The average combined totals of the GBIP for the relevant
three-month period are used to provide an average gas price for the
quarter.  This average gas price is increased by 1% and 3% per the
terms of the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements and is used by the
operators to calculate the royalties payable to the Trust for a
given quarter.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The change to the GBIP has
reduced the scope and cost of the accounting examination, eliminated
ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil regarding sales to related
parties, and reduced prior year adjustments to the normally
scheduled year-end reconciliation.  The pricing basis has also
eliminated certain costs that were previously deductible prior to
the royalty calculation under the OEG Agreement.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">On approximately the 25th
of the months of January, April, July and October, the operating
companies calculate the volume of gas sold during the previous
calendar quarter.  This volume of gas sold is then multiplied by
the average adjusted GBIP available at that time.  The respective
royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the monthly royalty
payments to the Trust for the Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter.  When
the operating companies determine the actual amount of royalties that
were payable for the prior calendar quarter, they also look at the
actual amount of royalties that were paid to the Trust for that
period and calculate the difference between what was paid and what
was payable.  Positive adjustments are paid immediately and any
negative adjustments are deducted from the next royalty payment.
In September of the succeeding calendar year, the operating
companies make the final determination of any necessary royalty
adjustments for the prior calendar year with a positive or negative
adjustment made accordingly.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">There are two types of
natural gas found within the Oldenburg concession, sweet gas and
sour gas.  Sweet gas has little contaminants and needs very minor
treatment before it can be sold.  Sour gas, in comparison, must
be processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it
can be sold.  The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide
and other contaminants.  The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is
converted to sulfur in a liquid or solid form, which is sold
separately.  With full operation of the two units, raw gas input
capacity stands at approximately 400 million cubic feet ("MMcf") per
day.  EMPG has indicated to the Trust's consultant in Germany that
it intends to shut down one of the remaining two units in June 2023.
The retirement of this unit is planned by EMPG as otherwise state
authorities would mandate a full and costly recertification of its
vessels and pipes which will have reached their required expiration
date.  Since the units are roughly equal in size, full operation of
the remaining unit would be approximately 200 MMcf per day following
the shutdown.  It is expected that the single unit will be sufficient
to handle sour gas production through-put from the concession.  It is
also expected that operating expenses in the future will be somewhat
reduced by this measure.  Since sour gas accounts for 75% of overall
gas sales and 98% of western gas sales, any future shutdown could
significantly impact royalty income. The Trust has insufficient data
to predict whether, when and to what extent any future shutdown may
occur.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">For unit owners, changes in
the U.S. dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact.  This
impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are paid to the
Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable
exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the Trust's bank
account in the U.S.  In relation to the U.S. dollar, a
stronger Euro would yield more U.S. dollars and a weaker Euro would
yield fewer U.S. dollars.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Seasonal demand factors
affect the income from the Trust's royalty rights insofar as they
relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in prices, but
on average they are generally not material to the annual income
received under the Trust's royalty rights.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust has no means of
ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their
present level or otherwise.  The assets of the Trust are depleting
assets and, if the operators developing the concession do not perform
additional development projects, the assets may deplete faster than
expected.  Eventually, the assets of the Trust will cease to produce
in commercial quantities and the Trust will cease to receive proceeds
from such assets. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust's consultant in
Germany provides general information to the Trust on the German and
European economies and energy markets as well as monitoring the
continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and ongoing efforts by the
European governments to respond to the economic impacts of the war.
This information provides a context in which to evaluate the actions
of the operating companies.  The Trust's consultant receives reports
from EMPG with respect to current and planned drilling and exploration
efforts.  However, EMPG and the operating companies continue to limit
the information flow to that which is required by German law, and the
Trust is not able to confirm the accuracy of any of the information
supplied by EMPG or the operating companies.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The low level of
administrative expenses of the Trust limits the effect of inflation on
costs.  Sustained price inflation would be reflected in sales prices.
Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on which the
royalties paid to the Trust are computed.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Results:&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal 2022 versus Fiscal
2021</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">For fiscal 2022, the Trust's
gross royalty income increased 286.76% to $17,800,119 from $4,602,410
in fiscal 2021.  The war in Ukraine has had and continues to have a
significant impact on royalties paid to the Trust.  The reduction
in the flow of Russian gas to Germany and to Europe as a whole has led
to shortages.  These shortages have resulted in a bidding war for
limited gas supplies available and continue to support higher gas
prices.  The increase in the amount of royalty income resulted in the
higher distribution.  The total distribution for fiscal 2022 was
$1.83 per unit compared to $0.47 per unit for fiscal 2021.  Gas
prices under both royalty agreements were higher while gas sales and
average exchange rates were down.  The royalty income received under
the Mobil Agreement in fiscal 2022 increased by $8,102,062 as
compared to fiscal 2021.  Royalty income received under the OEG
Agreement in fiscal 2022 increased by $5,096,976 as compared to
fiscal 2021.  </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">As in prior years, the Trust
receives adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the previous periods.  During
fiscal 2022, the adjustments based on royalties payable for 2021
increased royalty income by $1,550,020.  During fiscal 2021, the
adjustments based on royalties payable for 2020 decreased royalty income
by $696,189.  In fiscal 2022 and 2021, Mobil sulfur royalties totaled
$316,527 and $178,367, respectively.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Gas sales under the Mobil
Agreement decreased 5.99% to 14.874 Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal
2022 from 15.821 Bcf in fiscal 2021.  Given the lack of drilling by the
operating companies during 2022, the Trust's consultant in Germany
believes the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction in
well pressure that is experienced over time. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Excluding the effects of
differences in prices and average exchange rates, the combination of
royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg results in an effective
royalty rate approximately seven times higher than the royalty rate on
gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.  This is of particular significance to
the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the bulk of
royalties paid to the Trust.  For fiscal 2022, the volume of gas sold
from western Oldenburg accounted for only 27.86% of the volume of all
gas sales.  However, western Oldenburg gas royalties provided approximately
74.29% or $12,512,346 out of a total of $16,842,689 in overall Oldenburg
gas royalties.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Gas sales under the OEG Agreement
decreased 1.04% to 53.385 Bcf in fiscal 2022 from 53.947 Bcf in fiscal
2021.  Given the lack of drilling by the operating companies during 2022,
the Trust's consultant in Germany believes the decline in gas production
is due to the normal reduction in well pressure that is experienced over
time.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">Interest income for fiscal
2022 of $2,244 increased from interest income of $641 for fiscal

increased $87,423, or 13.95%, to $713,917 in fiscal 2022 from $626,494

<p align="left"><u>Report on Drilling and Geophysical Work</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The Trust's German consultant
periodically contacts the representatives of the operating companies to
inquire about their planned and proposed drilling and geophysical work
and other general matters.  The following represents a summary of the
most recent information the Trust's German consultant received from
representatives of EMPG in December 2022.  The Trust is not able to
confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the
operating companies.  In addition, the operating companies are not
required to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their
plans with respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to
inform the Trust.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<p align="left">The Trust's German consultant has advised the Trust
that EMPG has not planned any new wells for calendar 2023 and no major
work has been initiated on the exploration side.</p>

<p align="left">Production levels of the OEG fields for 2022 have
demonstrated that numerous maintenance efforts, including well cleanup
jobs and foam jobs to de-water weak wells, have been conducted to
maintain production.</p>

<p align="left">As of the current date and despite the difficult energy
situation in Germany, the government has taken no steps to encourage or
support domestic development of hydrocarbon-based energy sources.  It
should be noted that the economic impact on energy prices resulting
from the invasion of Ukraine by Russia continues and shows no sign of
abating.  Under these circumstances, current decisions at both the
governmental and corporate levels may change.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Critical Accounting Estimates</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent:40px">The financial statements,
appearing subsequently in this Report, present financial statement
balances and financial results on a modified cash basis of accounting,
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP basis").
Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty
trusts such as the Trust.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose
income as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts
or payments.  The use of GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for
expected royalty payments.  This is exceedingly difficult since the
Trust has very limited information on such payments until they are
received and cannot accurately project such amounts.  The Trust's
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is
received and expenses when cash is paid.  The one modification of
the cash basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for
distributions to be paid to unit owners (those distributions
approved by the Trustees for the Trust).  The Trust's distributable
income represents royalty income received by the Trust during the
period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust,
all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the
modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the
unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for
tax reporting purposes.</p>

contain forward-looking statements intended to qualify for the safe
harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995.  All statements other than statements of historical
fact are forward-looking.  Such statements address future expectations
and events or conditions concerning the Trust.  You can identify many
forward-looking statements by words such as "may," "will," "would,"
"should," "could," "expects," "aim," "anticipates," "believes,"
"estimates," "intends," "plan," "predict," "project," "seek,"
"potential," "opportunities" and other similar expressions and the
negatives of such expressions. However, not all forward-looking
statements contain these words.  Many of these statements are based on
information provided to the Trust by the operating companies or by
consultants using public information sources.  These statements are
subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those anticipated in any
forward-looking statements.  These include:</p>

factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for the Trust
to predict all such factors or to assess the impact of each such factor
on the Trust.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date

FIRM</p>

<p align="left">To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of<br>
North European Oil Royalty Trust</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Opinion on the Financial
Statements</strong></p>

<p align="left">We have audited the accompanying statements of assets,
liabilities and trust corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the
"Trust") as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of
revenue collected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in
cash and cash equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended
October 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the
"financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus
of the Trust as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and its revenue collected and
expenses paid, undistributed earnings and changes in its cash and cash
equivalents for each of the two years in the period ended October 31, 2021,
in conformity with the modified cash basis of accounting described in
Note 1.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Basis for Opinion</strong></p>

<p align="left">These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm
registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>

<p align="left">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p>

<p align="left">Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Basis of Accounting</strong></p>

<p align="left">As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been
prepared on the modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis
of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.</p>

<p align="center">F-1</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Critical Audit Matters</strong></p>

<p align="left">Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period
audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures
that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no
critical audit matters.</p>

ROYALTY TRUST</u></center></p>

<p><center><u>NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS </u></center></p>

<p><center><u>OCTOBER 31, 2022 AND 2021</U></CENTER></P>

<p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(1)&emsp;Summary of significant accounting
policies:</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-left:40px"><u>Basis of accounting
-</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The accompanying financial
statements of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") are prepared
in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  Financial
statement balances and financial results are presented on a modified
cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP basis").  In the opinion of management, all adjustments
that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of these
financial statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurring
nature, have been included. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">On a modified cash basis,
revenue is earned when cash is received and expenses are incurred when
cash is paid.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose revenue as
earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or
payments.  The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to permit
the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by
the Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses
incurred by the Trust, all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the
Trustees, the use of the modified cash basis of accounting provides a
more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of
operations of the Trust. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust receives
adjustments from the operating companies based on their final
calculations of royalties payable during the prior periods, including
the immediately preceding calendar quarter.  Negative adjustments are
carried over to the succeeding quarter.  There were no negative
adjustments during fiscal 2022.  A negative adjustment of Euros
444,931 ($538,651) from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was carried
over and offset against royalty revenue received in the first quarter
of fiscal 2021.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Producing gas and oil
royalty rights -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">	The rights to certain gas
and oil royalties in Germany were transferred to the Trust at their
net book value by North European Oil Company (the "Company") (see
Note 2). The net book value of the royalty rights has been reduced to
one dollar ($1) since the remaining net book value
of royalty rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received
and distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful
relationship to the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of
proved producing reserves. </p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u> Federal and state
income taxes -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust, as a grantor trust
and additionally under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal
Revenue Service, is exempt from federal income taxes.  The Trust has no
state income tax obligations.</p>

<p align="center">F-7</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Cash and cash equivalents -
</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Cash and cash equivalents are
defined as amounts deposited in bank accounts and amounts invested in
certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury bills with original
maturities generally of three months or less from the date of purchase.
The investment options available to the Trust are limited in accordance
with specific provisions of the Trust Agreement.  As of October 31, 2022,
the uninsured amounts held in the Trust's U.S. bank accounts were
$6,933,575.  In addition, the Trust held Euros 10,000, the equivalent
of $9,882, in its German bank account at October 31, 2022.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>Net income per unit -</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">	Net income per unit is based
upon the number of units outstanding at the end of the period.  As of
October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 9,190,590 units of beneficial
interest outstanding.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px"><u>New accounting
pronouncements - </u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust is not aware of
any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards that
would be expected to have a significant impact on the Trust's
financial position or results of operations. </p>

<p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(2)&emsp;<u>Formation of the Trust:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust was formed on
September 10, 1975.  As of September 30, 1975, the Company was
liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the Company,
including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust.  The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust,
holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in
certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.
These rights are held under contracts with local German exploration
and development subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group of Companies.  Under these contracts, the Trust
receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of
certain products from the areas involved.  At the present time,
royalties are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas,
crude oil, condensate and sulfur.</p>

<p align="left">(3)&emsp;<u>Related party transactions:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">John R. Van Kirk, the
Managing Director of the Trust, provides office services to the Trust
at cost.  For such office services, the Trust reimbursed the Managing
Director $5,256 and $5,613 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.</p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">As of December 31, 2021,
Lawrence A. Kobrin, a Trustee of the Trust, fully retired from Cahill
Gordon & Reindel LLP, which serves as counsel to the Trust.
Commencing January 1, 2022, payments to Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP
are no longer considered to be payments to a related party but instead
are included in operating expenses.  For fiscal 2022 and 2021, related
party legal expenses paid to Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP were $13,590
and $33,405, respectively.</p>

<p style="line-height:1px; height:1px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">(4)&emsp;<u>Employee benefit plan:</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust has established a
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE IRA) that is
available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is the Managing
Director.  The Trustees authorized the making of contributions by the
Trust to the accounts of employees, on a matching basis,
of up to 3% of cash compensation paid to each such employee for
the 2022 and 2021 calendar years.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Disclosure Controls and Procedures</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Trust is recorded, processed,
summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, which
consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.  The Managing
Director has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 31, 2022.  Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director
concluded that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of October 31, 2022.</p>

<p align="left"><u>Internal Control over Financial Reporting</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">Part A.&emsp;<u>Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</u></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: 40px">The Trust's management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f)) for the Trust.  There are inherent limitations in the
effectiveness of any internal control, including the possibility of
human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.
Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of
internal control may vary over time.  Management has evaluated the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2022.  This assessment was based on criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting described in the standards
promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in
the <i>Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)</i> issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of October 31, 2022.</P>
