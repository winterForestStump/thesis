10-K (&#8220;Annual Report&#8221;) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All statements
contained in this Annual Report, other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results
and financial position, our business strategy and plans, potential growth or growth prospects, future research and development, sales
and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Words
such as &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; &#8220;continues,&#8221;

&#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;targets,&#8221; and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and
trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business
operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions,
including those described in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in this Annual Report. Readers are urged to carefully review and consider
the various disclosures made in this Annual Report and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) that disclose risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us to predict all risks, nor can we assess
the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
the future events and circumstances discussed in this Annual Report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely
from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.</p><div>

contract manufacturing company focused on becoming the premier contract research, development, and manufacturing organization for the
emerging psychotropics-based medicines industry. In August&#160;2021, Health Canada&#8217;s Office of Controlled Substances granted us
a Controlled Drugs and Substances Dealer&#8217;s Licence under Part&#160;J of the Food and Drug Regulations promulgated under the Food
and Drugs Act (Canada), or a Dealer&#8217;s Licence. A Dealer&#8217;s Licence authorizes us to develop, sell, deliver, and manufacture
(through extraction or synthesis) certain pharmaceutical-grade active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in controlled substances
and their raw material precursors. Since current Canadian regulations prohibit the commercial sales of APIs and other products we intend
to produce, APIs and such other products would only be authorized for sale in Canada for clinical testing purposes in an &#8220;institution,&#8221;
for the purpose of determining the hazards and efficacy of the drug, and for laboratory research in an institution by qualified investigators.
Our mission is to make our products and research services available to our clients for the development of medicines and experimental therapies
to address certain psychiatric health disorders and other medical needs. We cannot guarantee that we will receive further approvals from
Health Canada, and a failure to receive such approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in an inability
to generate revenue from said products and services. Further, as of the date of this prospectus, we have not manufactured all of the psychedelics-based
products allowable under the Dealer&#8217;s Licence or generated any revenues from the sale of such psychedelics-based products.</p><div>

plan is dependent on our activities being permissible under applicable laws and upon the occurrence of regulatory changes for psychotropics-based
medicines. In Canada, the psychedelic compounds that we are approved to produce under our Dealer&#8217;s Licence, psilocybin, psilocin,
lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, or N,N-DMT, and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, and 4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxybenzeneethanamine,
or 2C-B, are regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, or CDSA. Certain psychedelic substances, including psilocybin, psilocin,
mescaline and DMT, are classified as Schedule III drugs and the CDSA prohibits the possession of a Schedule III drug absent authorization
under the CDSA or a related regulation, and it is illegal to possess Schedule III substances without a prescription. In the United States,
these substances are classified under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. &#167; 811), or the CSA, and the Controlled Substances
Import and Export Act, or the CSIEA, and as such, medical and recreational use is illegal under the U.S. federal laws. Under the CSA,
the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, regulates chemical compounds with a potential for abuse as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances.
Schedule I substances may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Most, if not all, state laws in the United States
classify psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT and 2C-B as Schedule I controlled substances. For any product containing any of these substances to
be available for commercial marketing in the United States, the applicable substance must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be
scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. If the DEA does not reschedule psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT and 2C-B as Schedule II,
III, IV or V, such substances will be subject to individually-allotted manufacturing and procurement quotas, which may have a material
adverse effect on our business and result in an inability to generate sufficient revenue from said substances to be profitable. Additionally,
regardless of the scheduling of a finished, approved therapeutic product, if the API used in the final dosage form is a Schedule I or
II controlled substance, it would be subject to such quotas as the API could remain listed on Schedule I or II. Moreover, even if the
finished dosage form of a psychedelics-based medicine developed by one of our clients is approved by the FDA, and if such product is listed
by the DEA as a Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance, its manufacture, importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage,
sale and legitimate use will continue to be subject to a significant degree of regulation by the DEA.</p><div>

of chemical substances that can cause alterations in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, or behavior through various interactions
with the nervous system. Psychedelics are a subclassification of psychotropics that interact primarily with serotonergic receptors in
the brain. Psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin, psilocin, LSD N,N-DMT, and MDMA, have become areas of interest for many new companies.
The psychedelic compounds we are approved to produce under our Dealer&#8217;s Licence&#160;&#8212;&#160;psilocybin, psilocin, N,N-DMT,
mescaline, MDMA, LSD, and 4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxybenzeneethanamine, or 2C-B&#160;&#8212;&#160;will represent our initial areas of focus

Canada with respect to the expansion of the scope of our Dealer&#8217;s Licence, we expect to extend our research and production efforts
to various non-serotonergic psychotropics, such as ketamine, as such compounds may provide significant future market opportunities for
us. Since current Canadian regulations prohibit the commercial sales of APIs and other products we intend to produce, APIs and such other
products would only be authorized for sale in Canada for clinical testing purposes in an &#8220;institution,&#8221; for the purpose of
determining the hazards and efficacy of the drug, and for laboratory research in an institution by qualified investigators. We cannot
guarantee we will receive such approvals, and a failure to receive further approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business
and result in an inability to generate revenue from said substances.</p><div>

Brazil, and Switzerland, the renaissance in psychedelic research in recent&#160;years, in particular studies involving psilocybin and
LSD, coupled with anecdotal reports of cognitive benefits from micro-dosing, suggests that they may have a therapeutic role in a range
of psychiatric and neurological conditions due to their potential to enhance functional neuronal connectivity, stimulate neurogenesis,
restore brain plasticity, reduce inflammation, and enhance cognition. In 2021, scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles
made significant discoveries about the interaction of LSD with dopamine that they believe may lead to a better understanding and eventual
treatment of schizophrenia and that shows promise in the pursuit of treating physically crippling disorders such as Parkinson&#8217;s

research efforts, as well as broad support from both the psychiatric health community and the general public (according to an independent
study conducted by Prohibition Partners in 2020), have prompted U.S.&#160;and Canadian regulatory bodies to re-evaluate various psychedelic
compound classifications. In Canada, drug decriminalization is being strongly considered throughout the nation, government initiatives
such as Safe Supply and the Special Access Program for Drugs may provide opportunities for market growth. Similarly, in 2017, the U.S.&#160;Food
and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, Breakthrough Therapy
Designation to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD on the basis of pooled analyses showing a large effect size for this
treatment. In 2018 and 2019, the FDA granted the Usona Institute&#160;Breakthrough Therapy Designation for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy
for the treatment of MDD. In 2019, the FDA approved the use of S-ketamine nasal spray, in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, for
the treatment of TRD, which marked the first approval by the FDA of a psychedelics-based therapy. In February&#160;2021, Oregon commenced
the first state-regulated psilocybin program, and concurrently, Washington, D.C. joined other cities including Oakland and Santa Cruz,
California, and Ann Arbor, Michigan in decriminalizing the cultivation and possession of all entheogenic plants and fungi. Decriminalize
Nature, an entheogenic educational campaign, currently has active lobbying campaigns ongoing in 42 cities in the United&#160;States to
decriminalize psychedelics. In January 2022, the Canada Gazette published a notice of amended regulations related to restricted drugs
that allow practitioners the ability to request access to restricted drugs through the Special Access Program for the emergency treatment
of patients with serious or life-threatening injuries.</p><div>

and operations are located near Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, where we currently lease approximately 25,000 square feet of laboratory
and office space. The property lease expires on July&#160;31, 2027, at which point we may, at our option, either extend this lease for
an additional five-year term or purchase the facility. We have the option to purchase the property for CAD $14.5&#160;million during the
lease term. Our facility has been designed to support key enabling technologies and production workflow, and feature two floors of compartmentalized
production bays, analytics laboratories, office space, and loading docks. With critical input from our highly experienced leadership team,
operators, and advisors, our facility was designed to maximize production while minimizing waste through the use of high-efficiency climate
and lighting systems. Furthermore, our security-by-design approach maintains high standards of safety and security, including expert implementation
of overlapping surveillance and monitoring systems, controlled access and alarms, and multiple Health Canada security level 8 vaults.
We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able
to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.</p><div>

Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, or the 1988 Convention. The Single Convention established the drug
scheduling system, which is also used in the 1971 Convention, to establish various degrees of control applicable to controlled substances,
or substances with a potential for abuse. The 1988 Convention focuses on criminal enforcement against illicit drug trafficking and money
laundering. All three conventions seek to restrict the use of controlled substances to legitimate purposes and avoid their diversion into

a regulatory framework and four schedules for psychotropic substances, which are substances that affect one&#8217;s mental state, including
hallucinogenic, or psychedelic, drugs. In addition to requiring controls on the manufacture, trade, distribution, and possession of psychotropic
substances, the 1971 Convention requires that signatories provide the International Narcotics Control Board, or INCB, with annual statistical
reports of quantities of psychotropic substances manufactured, exported from, or imported to their country. If, based on the information
provided, the INCB has reason to believe that the aims of the 1971 Convention are endangered, it can ask an endangering country to provide
explanations for its deviation from the 1971 Convention; call on the government to adopt remedial measures; or, bring the matter to the
attention of the greater UN and recommend that the country stop the export and/or import of a particular psychotropic substance. Regarding

a secure facility for the storage of controlled drugs and substances. There are 11 security levels applicable to controlled drugs and

relevant laws (Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, Food and Drugs Regulations) and subject to any restrictions placed on the licence
by Health Canada, an entity with a Dealer&#8217;s Licence may produce, assemble, sell, provide, transport, send, deliver, import or export
a restricted drug (as listed in Part&#160;J in the Food and Drugs Regulations, which includes psilocybin and psilocin) (see s. J.01.009(1)&#160;of
the Food and Drug Regulations). However, a licenced dealer may only import and export controlled substances and restricted drugs in accordance
with a permit from Health Canada, which must be obtained for each import or export.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">There are a number of reasons
that Health Canada must refuse a licence under applicable law. For example, a licence must be refused if an applicant does not have prescribed
security measures in place, the applicant has submitted false or misleading information with respect to its licence application, or there
are reasonable grounds to believe that the issuance of the licence would likely create a risk to public health or safety, including the
risk of a restricted drug being diverted to an illicit market or use. Once issued, Health Canada has the authority to suspend or revoke
a Dealer&#8217;s Licence if it has reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary to do so to protect public health or safety, which
includes preventing a restricted drug from being reverted to an illicit market or use.</p><div>

export psychedelics is not guaranteed under a Dealer&#8217;s Licence, and there is risk that Health Canada may not issue an export permit
at each or any request. By law, an export permit must not be issued for a restricted drug where, among other things, the issuing body
has reasonable grounds to believe that the exportation would contravene an international obligation, or where there are reasonable grounds
to believe that the exportation would contravene the laws of the country of final destination or any country of transit or transhipment.
Therefore, even with a valid Dealer&#8217;s Licence issued for the production of psilocybin, legal export of APIs to customers outside
of Canada is not guaranteed.</p><div>

may only sell psychedelics to an institution for clinical or research purposes. In Canada, an &#8220;institution&#8221; under Part&#160;J
of the Food and Drug Regulations is defined as any institution engaged in research on drugs and includes a hospital, a university in Canada
or a department or agency of the Government of Canada or of a government of a province or any part of them. Prior to the sale, the research

a Section&#160;56(1)&#160;exemption are not defined in the CDSA.&#160;An applicant seeking a Section&#160;56(1)&#160;exemption for scientific
purposes must provide a project or study description, including a research protocol and approval by an animal care committee if applicable.
Administration to human subjects is not permitted under an exemption for scientific purposes, whereas administration to animals may be
permitted under certain conditions. An application for an exemption to use a controlled substance for clinical studies requires the submission
of a clinical trial protocol and an authorization from Health Canada to conduct a clinical trial (in the form of a No Objection Letter).
Physical security measures must be maintained at any facility in which research or clinical trials are conducted under a Section&#160;56(1)&#160;exemption.
To our knowledge, the Canadian government has not yet granted a Section&#160;56(1)&#160;exemption for the use of psychedelics.</p><div>

evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to Health Canada for approval.
Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by a Research Ethics Board, or REB, for each site at which the clinical
trial will be conducted. The REB is not affiliated with the clinical trial sponsor, and its principal mandate is to approve the initiation
of, and conduct periodic reviews of, biomedical research involving human subjects in order to ensure the protection of subject rights,

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Controlled substances are defined
as drugs or other substances that have a potential for abuse. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage,
disposal and other requirements on any person or entity that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, exports, or conducts research
with controlled substances. These requirements have been established to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels
of commerce while providing for the legitimate medical and scientific needs of the United&#160;States. The United&#160;States Attorney
General has delegated responsibility for the regulation of controlled substances to the DEA.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The DEA categorizes controlled
substances into one of five schedules &#8212; Schedule&#160;I,&#160;II,&#160;III,&#160;IV or&#160;V &#8212; with varying qualifications
for listing in each schedule. Schedule&#160;I controlled substances are those that have a high potential for abuse, have no currently
accepted medical use in the United&#160;States and are not accepted as capable of being safely used under medical supervision. Substances
having a currently accepted medical use, including pharmaceutical products, may be listed as Schedule&#160;II,&#160;III,&#160;IV or&#160;V
controlled substances, with Schedule&#160;II controlled substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological
dependence, and Schedule&#160;V controlled substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory
requirements are more restrictive for handlers of Schedule&#160;II controlled substances than Schedule&#160;III-V controlled substances.
For example, all Schedule&#160;II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations,
and cannot be refilled. Psychotropics such as psilocybin, psilocin, DMT and MDMA are regulated as Schedule&#160;I controlled substances,
and have the strictest controls imposed upon their use for any purpose.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Scheduling determinations by
the DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance for medical use and marketing in the United&#160;States.
Therefore, while psilocybin and the other psychedelic substances we may cultivate and manufacture are primarily Schedule&#160;I controlled
substances, products approved by FDA for medical use and marketing in the United&#160;States that contain psilocybin or another such substance
would be placed in Schedules&#160;II-V, since approval by FDA satisfies the &#8220;accepted medical use&#8221; requirement. If and when
a product candidate developed by one of our clients receives FDA approval, the DEA will likely make a scheduling determination and place
it in a schedule other than Schedule&#160;I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United&#160;States.</p><div>

registration if it determines that &#8220;such registration is consistent with the public interest and with United&#160;States obligations

necessary to provide for the medical, scientific, or other legitimate needs of the United&#160;States in the case that competition among
domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is inadequate and will not be rendered adequate by the registration of additional manufacturers.
In determining whether domestic competition is adequate, the DEA must consider price rigidity, conditions of supply and demand, and the
extent of service and quality competition among the domestic manufacturers. The fact that there are only a small number of registered
manufacturers for a particular controlled substance is not indicative of a lack of competition.</p><div>

production quotas set a ceiling on the amount of bulk Schedule&#160;I or&#160;II substances that may be manufactured in, or imported into,
the United&#160;States in any given year. The country&#8217;s aggregate production quota, or APQ, reflects the total quantity of each

to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the country, for lawful export requirements, and for
the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. The APQ can be adjusted at any time, but only at the discretion of the DEA.&#160;The
APQ is divided among registered bulk manufacturers as individual manufacturing quotas. Registered bulk manufacturers wishing to manufacture
bulk quantities of Schedule&#160;I or&#160;II controlled substances in the United&#160;States must apply for individual manufacturing
quotas every year, and may not manufacture more than their assigned allotment without a modification to their manufacturing quota from

schedule a controlled substance or product containing a controlled substance. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on
federal action, other states schedule drugs through rule making or a legislative action. However, any state law in positive conflict with
the CSA is superseded by the CSA.</p><div>

the state legalization of cannabis for medical use in California in 1996, U.S.&#160;jurisdictions have been modifying their own controlled
substance laws and criminal enforcement policies to allow for broader manufacture, distribution, dispensing, and possession of certain
controlled substances, in contravention of the CSA.&#160;While cannabis has been the most widespread example of this tension between state
and federal law, the therapeutic use of psychedelics is now gaining traction in U.S.&#160;cities and states. For instance, the city and
county of Denver voted in 2019 to make the enforcement of any laws imposing criminal penalties for the personal use and personal possession
of psilocybin mushrooms the lowest law enforcement priority in the city and county of Denver, and in Oregon, Measure 109 was passed in
November&#160;2020 directing the Oregon Health Authority, or OHA, after a two-year development period, to license and regulate the manufacturing,
transportation, delivery, sale and purchase of psilocybin products and the provision of psilocybin services. Oakland and Santa Cruz, California,
Washington, D.C., and Ann Arbor, Michigan have declared the enforcement of laws that criminalize the non-commercial planting, cultivating,
purchasing, transporting, distributing, possessing or engaging in practices with entheogenic plants among their lowest law enforcement
priorities. Forty-one states and the U.S.&#160;Congress have adopted &#8220;right-to-try&#8221; laws, allowing patients with terminal
conditions to try investigational drugs which have passed Phase&#160;I clinical trials but have not yet been approved for general use.
The investigational drugs accessible via right-to-try laws include psychedelics-based drugs. In September&#160;2021, the Washington State
attorney general argued in defense of the state&#8217;s right-to-try laws in a case challenging the DEA&#8217;s assertion that it has
no authority to help practitioners implement the laws. The case arose from a doctor&#8217;s request to give psilocybin to terminally ill
patients.</p><div>

United&#160;States have decriminalized or even legalized and regulated psychedelics to varying extents, employing varying regulatory frameworks,
participation in these state frameworks would be in violation of the CSA and could lead to federal prosecution, including seizure of assets

psychedelics markets that are in contravention of U.S.&#160;federal law.</p><div>

other laws. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time with respect to product development, clinical testing,
approval or any other legal requirements relating to product manufacture, processing, handling, storage, quality control, safety, marketing,
advertising, promotion, packaging, labelling, export, import, distribution, or sale may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions or
other legal consequences. These sanctions or consequences could include, among other things, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending
applications, issuance of clinical holds for ongoing studies, suspension or revocation of approved applications, warning or untitled letters,
product withdrawals or recalls, product seizures, relabeling or repackaging, total or partial suspensions of manufacturing or distribution,
injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local

for safety/toxicology studies and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. The results of the preclinical

any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial,
administration procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and
evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.&#160;Furthermore,
each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board for each institution at which the clinical trial will
be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable compared to

recognition in the industry. Our ability to become profitable will be dependent upon, in part and among other things, the size of the

manufacturing facility, developing our cultivation, extraction and purification processes, and building our executive management team.
We have not yet manufactured psychedelics-based products at commercial scale. The early stage of our cultivation, research and development
efforts makes it particularly uncertain whether any of our efforts will prove to be successful and meet the requirements of our customers,
and whether any of our products will be capable of being manufactured at a reasonable cost or be successfully marketed. We have no meaningful
operations upon which to evaluate our business and predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could
be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing active pharmaceutical ingredients
based on psychedelics. Accordingly, we are subject to many of the risks common to early-stage enterprises, including under-capitalization,
cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financial and other resources and lack of revenue. The limited operating history
may also make it difficult for investors to evaluate our prospects for success. There is no assurance that we will be successful, and
our likelihood of success must be considered in light of our early stage of operations.</p><div>

a relatively new industry and market. We believe that both regulators and the public have an increasing awareness and acceptance of this
field. Nevertheless, psychedelics remain a controlled substance in Canada, the United States and most other jurisdictions and their use
for research and therapeutic purposes remains highly regulated and narrow in scope. There is no assurance that the industry and market
will continue to grow as currently estimated or anticipated or function and evolve in the manner consistent with management&#8217;s expectations
and assumptions. Any event or circumstance that adversely affects the psychedelic manufacturing and medicines industry and market could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have committed and expect to continue
committing significant resources and capital to develop our psychedelics manufacturing facilities, refine our product offerings and establish
our contract research services program. As a category of products and services, medical-grade psychedelics, raw materials and psychedelics-derived
active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and research into such substances represent relatively untested offerings in the marketplace,
and we cannot provide assurance that psychedelics as a category, or that our products and services in particular, will achieve market
acceptance. Moreover, as a relatively new industry, there are not many established players in the psychedelic-based medicines industry
whose business model we can emulate. Similarly, there is little information about comparable companies available for potential investors
to review in making a decision about whether to invest in our common shares.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The strict regulatory environment
that governs our business activity has potential to severely limit our market opportunities both in Canada and the United States. Because
the APIs and other products we plan to produce are restricted drugs on the Schedule to Part J of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,
their sale in Canada will be authorized only for the purposes of clinical testing in an &#8220;institution&#8221; for the purpose of determining
the hazards and efficacy of the drug, and for laboratory research in the institution by qualified investigators. Sale of our APIs in Canada
for commercial purposes will be prohibited unless and until the substances we produce are removed from Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations.
This regulatory change may never happen, or it may not happen in time for our business to benefit from the change. Under the Food and
Drug Regulations, &#8220;institution&#8221; is defined as any institution engaged in research on drugs and includes a hospital, a university
in Canada or a department or agency of the Canadian government. While we believe that Health Canada is likely to interpret this definition
broadly to allow sales to private biopharmaceutical companies conducting research in this space, there remains a risk that Health Canada
may take a more restrictive view of which facilities qualify as &#8220;institutions&#8221; under the law. A restrictive interpretation
would limit our potential customers in Canada, even for clinical testing and laboratory research purposes. In the United States, where
most of the substances we intend to produce are currently listed on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, the DEA will only approve
an import permit for our potential U.S. clients if U.S. domestic supply of the substance is found to be inadequate for scientific studies,
or if competition among domestic manufacturers of the substance is inadequate for medical or scientific needs and will not be rendered
adequate by the registration of additional U.S. domestic manufacturers. If U.S. manufacturers begin to produce the same APIs we produce,
and the DEA determines that U.S. domestic supply or competition is adequate, we may not be able to export to U.S. customers at all. Our
ability to sell our products on a commercial scale in the United States also depends on the substances being rescheduled to a schedule
that permits their use for commercial manufacture, as Schedule I substances can only be used for research purposes. Even if the substances
we produce are rescheduled to Schedule II, however, their use will still entail significant restrictions that may severely limit our market
potential in the United States. In order to sell our products in the United States, it is possible that we will have to establish a U.S.
manufacturing facility, which would be costly and time-consuming. All of the above are unknown variables and contingencies that affect
our ability to commercialize our products in Canada and the United States.</p><div>

addition, these opponents may seek to generate negative publicity in an effort to persuade the medical community to reject these therapies.
Anti-psychedelic protests have historically occurred and may occur in the future and generate media coverage. Political pressures and
adverse publicity could lead to delays in, and increased expenses for, and limit or restrict the introduction and marketing of, psychedelics-based

affected if the public loses confidence in the safety, efficacy, and quality of psychedelics-based products, due to adverse events reported
in clinical trials or otherwise. Negative public perceptions could cause the market for such products to shrink and may compel regulators
to impose stringent requirements on the development of any such products. If such events were to occur, fewer academic institutions and

face specific marketing challenges given the products&#8217; status as a controlled substance, which resulted in past and current public
perception that the products have negative health and lifestyle effects and have the potential to cause physical and social harm due to
psychoactive and potentially addictive effects. Any marketing efforts we or our clients may undertake would need to overcome this perception
to build consumer confidence, brand recognition and goodwill. Consumer perception can be significantly influenced by scientific research
or findings regarding the consumption of psychedelic inspired products. There can be no assurance that such research or findings will
be favorable towards psychedelics-based products, or even if favorable, that such research or findings will be effective in convincing
a sufficient portion of the population that psychedelics-based therapies are safe and effective. Conversely, adverse publicity about psychedelics-based

remains in early stages. There have been relatively few clinical trials on the benefits of such products. Although we believe that the
currently available studies support our beliefs regarding the medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing and social acceptance
of psychedelic and other psychotropic products, future research and clinical trials may prove such statements to be incorrect, or could
raise concerns regarding, and perceptions relating to, psychedelics-based raw material precursors and APIs. Given these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, potential investors should understand that the breadth of application of psychedelics-based medicines may not be as expansive
as the existing research suggests. Future research studies and clinical trials may draw opposing conclusions to those stated in this Annual
Report or reach negative conclusions regarding the potential medical benefits, viability, safety, efficacy, dosing, social acceptance
or other facts and perceptions related to psychedelic and other psychotropic products, which could have a material adverse effect on the
demand for our products with the potential to lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p><div>

which relies predominantly on the synthetic manufacture of these materials and refinement into isolated single molecules (e.g., psilocybin).
However, we cannot provide assurances that the market for naturally derived psychedelics products will develop or that it will be as large
as we anticipate. There are multiple risks involved with this market strategy, including: our competitor&#8217;s synthetic manufacturing
processes may prove more cost-effective and efficient or may produce more consistent yields; key market participants we might otherwise
target as clients may already be more familiar and comfortable working with synthetically manufactured psychedelics products; regulatory
developments may favour synthetically derived psychedelics products; and psychedelics-based medicines developed with naturally derived

has established two programs which we believe may expand the market for our psychedelics-based products and those of our clients. The
Canadian government has created &#8220;safer supply programs,&#8221; or SSPs, pursuant to which a regulated supply of certain drugs will
be made available in order to combat the illegal drug supply and attendant risks of overdose and death. Additionally, Health Canada&#8217;s
Special Access Program for drugs, or SAP, enables drugs that are not marketed in Canada to be requested by practitioners for the treatment,
diagnosis, or prevention of serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable.
Special access by Canadian health practitioners to unauthorized drugs is for serious or life-threatening conditions where conventional
therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable either as marketed products, or through enrolment in clinical trials. We believe
that we or our clients may be able to utilize these programs to provide psychedelics-based therapies to consumers who might otherwise
face the risk of harm from the illegal drug supply or who would otherwise be unable to access potentially life-saving non-approved psychedelics-based

assurance that these programs continue or that they will provide the benefits that we anticipate. The SSPs are limited in scope and to
date have focused on providing a safer supply of opioids and other drugs that present a severe risk of overdose and death. To our knowledge,
the SSPs have not been used to prescribe medicinal psychedelics to consumers and may never be used for this purpose. With respect to the
SAP, the regulatory authority supporting the program is discretionary. In addition, access to restricted drugs, such as psychedelics,
through the SAP is prohibited. However, in December 2020, Health Canada, the body that administers the SAP, published its intention to
reverse the regulatory prohibition that prevents special access for restricted drugs. If and when that prohibition is removed the authorities
may still choose not to authorize psychedelics-based medicines through the program. A decision to authorize or deny a request is made
on a case-by-case basis by taking into consideration the nature of the applicable medical emergency, the availability of marketed alternatives
and the information provided in support of the request regarding the use, safety and efficacy of the drug. The SAP is not intended to
be a mechanism for circumventing drug clinical development or the regulatory review of a submission for marketing. Access to any drug
through the SAP is intended to be limited in duration and quantity to meet emergency needs only. In the event that a drug submission is
under regulatory review, access will be limited until that review is complete and the drug is marketed. Accordingly, psychedelics-based
medicines may not be authorized under the SAP, and even if they are, their availability under the program may be very limited, both in
terms of the breadth and duration of access. Moreover, our clients will be under no obligation to sell an unauthorized drug through the
SAP and Health Canada cannot compel a manufacturer to do so.</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Additionally, the use of
the programs described above entails risks. Drugs accessed through the SAP do not undergo the scrutiny of a benefit-risk assessment that
is part of the regulatory framework for a new drug submission or a clinical trial application. These drugs are exempt from the Canadian
Food and Drugs Act and its regulations. The decisions to authorize a drug through the SAP are based on a practitioner&#8217;s rationale
about the use of the drug for the medical emergency and how it would benefit their patient based on the patient&#8217;s clinical history.
Accordingly, an authorization through the SAP does not constitute an opinion that a drug is safe, efficacious or of high quality. To the
extent that our clients have not completed the clinical development progress and they make drugs using our raw materials or API available
through the SAP, we may directly or indirectly face a greater than average risk of product liability exposure.</p><div>

clients&#8217; products entail serious side effects, they could limit the dosing of such products, limit their frequency of use, limit
the targeted patient population or abandon the development of such products altogether. Regulatory authorities could also require additional
warnings in the product labelling. We and our clients could be sued and held liable for harm caused to clinical trial subjects or patients.</p><div>

of costly additional clinical trials, including post-market clinical trials. The applicable regulatory authority may also approve the
psychedelics-based product for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than our client originally requested. Any such
determinations by the applicable regulatory authority would delay or limit our ability to sell commercial-scale quantities of our products.
Additionally, even if approved, clients will be subject to post-approval regulations, and any failure to remain in compliance with these
regulations may impair their ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate, which will in turn materially diminish the market
for our medical-grade psychedelics materials and APIs.</p><div>

the number of NDAs and BLAs approved, the industry would contract and our business would be materially harmed. These regulatory agencies

become more accepted in the medical community. As such, we expect to compete with other similar businesses who will are or will begin
to supply medical-grade psychedelic raw materials, APIs and finished drug products and/or contract research services to clients such as
universities and biopharmaceutical companies to formulate a wide range of products. We expect to face intense competition from new or

of companies actively pursuing the development and contract manufacturing of psychedelics-based products and the provision of contract
research services in the psychedelics space. For example, Numinus Wellness Inc. is a Canada-based health care company focused on creating
wellness solutions centered on psychedelic therapies. Numinus is licenced in Canada to test, possess, buy and sell methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
or MDMA, psilocybin, psilocin, dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, and mescaline. Additionally, HAVN Life Sciences Inc. is a Canadian biotechnology
company pursuing standardized extraction of psychoactive compounds, the development of natural health care products and mental-health
treatments. These companies have greater experience than we do in the psychedelics manufacturing and research services industries and
as organizations they are more advanced in establishing and growing their businesses than we are. There can be no assurance that our competitors
are not currently developing, or will not in the future develop, products that are equally or more economically attractive as our products.
The emergence and licensing of additional U.S.-domiciled manufacturers of psychedelics-based raw ingredients or APIs may decrease our
clients&#8217; ability to obtain import permits to import our raw ingredients or APIs. The success of our competitors and their products
and technologies relative to our technological capabilities and competitiveness, and the increase in the U.S. domestic supply of psychedelics-based
raw materials or APIs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.</p><div>

developing or commercializing therapies to treat the same diseases or indications for which our products may be useful. As a result, our
clients will face significant competition in their efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize psychedelics-based
therapies. This competition will take the form of other companies pursuing similar psychedelics-based therapies, as well as from other
biopharmaceutical companies pursuing therapies for the same indications using alternative, more established approaches. For example, we
believe that psychedelics-based medicines may be effective in treating major depressive disorders. There are a number of companies that
currently market and sell products or therapies, or are pursuing the development of products or therapies, for the treatment of depression,
including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonergic norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics,
cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, repeat transcranial magnetic stimulation, or rTMS, electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, vagus nerve
stimulation, or VNS, and deep brain stimulation, or DBS, among others. Many of these pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology
competitors have established markets for their therapies and have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources
than our clients do and may be better equipped than our clients to develop, manufacture and market superior products or therapies. In
addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than our clients may have in undertaking preclinical studies
and human clinical trials of new therapeutic substances and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly,
competitors to our clients may develop therapies that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a
better safety profile than our clients&#8217; therapies and these competitors may also be more successful than our clients are in marketing
their therapies.</p><div>

industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We expect that our and our client&#8217;s
competitors will include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, natural health products companies, biotechnology companies,

than we or our clients have. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors to us and/or our clients,
particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting
and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel. If we are unable to compete effectively in the contract manufacturing
and services space against other companies providing such psychedelics-based products and services, or if our clients are unable to complete
effectively against other companies pursuing psychedelics-based medicines or other approaches to the treatment of the same indications

for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of clients or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those clients
or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facility and the equipment we use to perform our cultivation, research and development
work could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming and expensive to rebuild

coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a respiratory disease known as COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China. On January 30, 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency, and on March 11, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization. The pandemic has caused companies and various international jurisdictions to impose restrictions such as
quarantines, business closures and travel restrictions. While these effects are expected to be temporary and the administration of effective
vaccines has shown progress in some areas in significantly lowering the number of active infections, the duration of the business disruptions
internationally and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Governments and central banks have reacted with
significant monetary and fiscal interventions designed to stabilize economic conditions. The duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is unknown
at this time, as is the efficacy of the government and central bank interventions. It is not possible to reliably estimate the length
and severity of these developments and the impact on the financial results and condition of our business. However, depending on the length

drugs, including lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, MDMA, DMT and psilocybin, are regulated under the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act, or CDSA. The CDSA classifies regulated drug substances into five schedules, with Schedule I containing the highest risk substances.
Certain psychedelic substances, including psilocybin, psilocin, mescaline and DMT, are classified as Schedule III drugs. The CDSA prohibits
the possession of a Schedule III drug absent authorization under the CDSA or a related regulation (either via a license or an authorized
exemption). Health Canada has not approved psilocybin as a drug for any indication and it is illegal to possess Schedule III substances
without a prescription. Under Section 56(1) of the CDSA, the Minister of Health has the ability to grant exemptions to these restrictions
if the Minister deems them necessary for a medical or scientific purpose, or otherwise in the public interest. It is not clear exactly
how and when the Section 56(1) exemption may be granted for psychedelics. To date, a limited number of Section 56 exemptions for psilocybin
access or research have been granted in Canada. Further, a Dealer&#8217;s Licence for psychedelic drugs can be obtained from Health Canada
under Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations allowing for the possession, processing, sending, sale, transportation and delivery of products
containing a controlled substance such as psilocybin. Only a very limited number of Dealer&#8217;s Licences for psychedelics have been
granted in Canada.</p><div>

and Export Act, or the CSIEA, and as such, medical and recreational use is illegal under the U.S. federal laws. Under the CSA, the Drug
Enforcement Agency, or DEA, regulates chemical compounds with a potential for abuse as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule
I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently &#8220;accepted medical use&#8221; in the United States,
lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical
products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present
the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule
I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements
and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled
without a new prescription and may have a black box warning. Most, if not all, state laws in the United States classify psilocybin, LSD,
MDMA and DMT and as Schedule I controlled substances. For any product containing any of these substances to be available for commercial
marketing in the United States, the applicable substance must be rescheduled, or the product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule
II, III, IV or V. Commercial marketing in the United States will also require scheduling-related legislative or administrative action.&#160;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">Scheduling determinations
by the DEA are dependent on FDA approval of a substance or a specific formulation of a substance for medical use. Therefore, while psilocybin
and the other psychedelic substances we may cultivate and manufacture are Schedule I controlled substances, products developed by our
clients that are approved by the FDA for medical use in the United States that contain psilocybin or another such substance must be placed
in Schedules II-V prior to commercialization, since approval by the FDA satisfies the &#8220;accepted medical use&#8221; requirement.
If and when a product candidate developed by one of our clients receives FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and
place it in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. This scheduling determination
will be dependent on FDA approval and the FDA&#8217;s recommendation as to the appropriate schedule. During the review process, and prior
to approval, the FDA may determine that it requires additional data, either from non-clinical or clinical studies, including with respect
to whether, or to what extent, the substance has abuse potential. This may introduce a delay into the approval and any potential rescheduling
process. This scheduling determination will require the DEA to conduct notice and comment rule making including issuing an interim final
rule. Such action will be subject to public comment and requests for hearing which could affect the scheduling of these substances. There
can be no assurance that the DEA will make a favorable scheduling decision. Even assuming categorization as a Schedule II or lower controlled
substance (i.e., Schedule III, IV or V), at the federal level, such substances would also require scheduling determinations under state
laws and regulations. Even assuming that the applicable therapeutic candidate approved and scheduled by regulatory authorities to allow
their commercial marketing, the APIs in such therapeutic candidates would likely continue to be Schedule<b><i>&#160;</i></b>I, or the

Significant regulatory disclosure, oversight, and reporting are required to possess these substances, both to test and conduct preclinical

I or II controlled substances must apply for the issuance of procurement quotas in order to convert bulk substances on Schedule I or II

a facility may procure in a given year, and that quota cannot be exceeded without an amendment to the quota from the DEA. Accordingly,
any U.S. manufacturers to which we sell our psychedelics-based raw materials or API, and who wish to convert these into finished dosage

in or imported into the United States in a given year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs
of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. Individual manufacturing
quotas are issued to registered manufacturers who wish to manufacture a quantity of specific Schedule I or II controlled substances. Import
permits are only granted if the DEA finds that the United States&#8217; domestic supply of any controlled substance is inadequate for
scientific studies or finds that competition among domestic manufacturers of the controlled substance is inadequate and will not be rendered
adequate by the registration of additional manufacturers. The aggregate U.S. production quotas for psilocybin, psilocin, MDMA, and DMT

to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. The FDA&#8217;s responsibilities include regulating the ingredients as well
as the marketing and labelling of drugs sold in interstate commerce. Because it is currently illegal under federal law to produce and
sell psilocybin and psilocin, and because there are no federally recognized medical uses, the FDA has historically deferred enforcement

of psilocybin and psilocin as Schedule I controlled substances in the United States, there may be changes in the status of psilocybin

of any laws imposing criminal penalties for the personal use and personal possession of psilocybin mushrooms the lowest law enforcement
priority in the city and county of Denver, and in Oregon, Measure 109 was passed in November 2020 directing the Oregon Health Authority,
or OHA, after a two-year development period, to license and regulate the manufacturing, transportation, delivery, sale and purchase of
psilocybin products and the provision of psilocybin services. Other jurisdictions in Canada and the United States may proceed to authorize
decriminalization to varying extents and employing varying regulatory frameworks. The decriminalization of psilocybin or psilocin, or
other psychedelic substances, without regulatory oversight, or with inadequate or ineffective regulatory oversight, may lead to the setup
of clinics without proper therapeutic infrastructure or adequate clinical research, which could put patients at risk and bring reputational
and regulatory risk to the entire industry, making it harder for us to successfully operate our business. Furthermore, the legalization
of psilocybin or psilocin could also impact our commercial sales if our clients receive regulatory approval as it would reduce the barrier

are enforced through Health Canada&#8217;s and the FDA&#8217;s inspection programs. If Health Canada or the FDA determines that we are
not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those governing cGMPs, Health Canada or the FDA may not approve new
drug applications or submissions, or NDAs or NDSs, submitted by our clients and containing products manufactured by us until the deficiencies
are corrected. Correcting any such deficiencies may be costly and time-consuming, and it may harm our client relationships and status
in the marketplace. Moreover, our failure to comply with regulations application to our manufacturing facilities could result in sanctions
being imposed on us or our clients, including clinical holds, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, seizures or recalls of product candidates
or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect the demand for our

ongoing compliance with extensive FDA requirements and the requirements of other similar agencies, including ensuring that quality control
and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP requirements. As such, we are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess
compliance with cGMPs.</p><div>

of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future,
this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the

proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our investigational therapies, the defendant could counterclaim
that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States or in Europe, defendant counterclaims alleging
invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. A claim for a validity challenge may be based on failure to meet any of several statutory
requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. A claim for unenforceability assertion could be an allegation
that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement, during
prosecution. Third parties may also raise challenges to the validity of our patent claims before administrative bodies in the United States
or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, <i>inter partes</i> review,
interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (i.e., opposition proceedings).
Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of, or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover
our proprietary products or methods. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation
or other proceedings is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating
prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant or third party were to prevail on a legal
assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products or
methods. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations

foreign investment companies, or PFICs, can have adverse effects on U.S. Holders (as defined under &#8220;Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders&#8221;) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Generally, if, for any taxable year, at least 75% of
our gross income is passive income (such as interest income), or at least 50% of the gross value of our assets (determined on the basis
of a weighted quarterly average) is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income
(including cash), we would be characterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The determination of whether we are a PFIC,
which must be made annually after the close of each taxable year, depends on the particular facts and circumstances and may also be affected
by the application of the PFIC rules, which are subject to differing interpretations. Our status as a PFIC will depend on the composition
of our income and the composition and value of our assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), which will be affected by
how, and how quickly, we spend any cash that is raised in any financing transaction. Moreover, our ability to earn specific types of income
that will be treated as non-passive for purposes of the PFIC rules is uncertain with respect to future years. Based upon the current and
expected composition of our income and assets, we believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended June 30, 2022 and could be treated
as a PFIC for the current taxable year. The determination of whether we are a PFIC is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual
basis applying principles and methodologies that in some circumstances are unclear and subject to varying interpretation. Accordingly,
we cannot provide any assurances regarding our PFIC status for any current or future taxable years.</p><div>

U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations. A U.S. Holder may in certain circumstances mitigate adverse tax consequences of the PFIC
rules by filing an election to treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund, or QEF, or, if shares of the PFIC are &#8220;marketable stock&#8221;
for purposes of the PFIC rules, by making a mark-to-market election with respect to the shares of the PFIC. However, U.S. Holders should
be aware that there can be no assurance that we will satisfy the record keeping requirements that apply to a QEF, or that we will supply
U.S. Holders with information that such U.S. Holders require to report under the QEF election rules, in the event that we are a PFIC and

consists of trafficking in controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA) which is prohibited by U.S. federal
law or the law of any state in which such trade or business is conducted. The application of Code section 280E generally causes such businesses
to pay higher effective U.S. federal tax rates than similar businesses in other industries. Although the U.S. Internal Revenue Service,
or IRS, issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly and the
bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. There is no guarantee that any federal court
will issue an interpretation of Section 280E favorable to psilocybin and psilocin businesses.</p><div>

of those companies. In the past, shareholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If
we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management

Articles and certain provisions under the BCBCA, together or separately, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other
change in control of us that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which they might otherwise receive a premium
for their common shares. These provisions include the establishment of a staggered board of directors, which divides the board into three
groups, with directors in each group serving a three-year term. The existence of a staggered board can make it more difficult for shareholders
to replace or remove incumbent members of our board of directors. As such, these provisions could also limit the price that investors
might be willing to pay in the future for our common shares, thereby depressing the market price of our common shares. In addition, because
our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any
attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members
of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions include the following:</p><div>

while the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the Securities
Act be brought in federal court are &#8220;facially valid&#8221; under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether other courts,

Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters. The U.S. Federal Forum

to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Canada. Canadian courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an
alleged violation of U.S. securities laws against us or these persons on the grounds that Canada is not the most appropriate forum in
which to bring such a claim. Even if a Canadian court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Canadian law and not U.S. law is applicable
to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming
and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Canadian law. Furthermore, it may not be possible to subject
foreign persons or entities to the jurisdiction of the courts in Canada. Similarly, to the extent that our assets are located in Canada,
investors may have difficulty collecting from us any judgments obtained in the U.S. courts and predicated on the civil liability provisions

can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, and could include any negative publicity, whether true

to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groups to communicate and share opinions and views regarding
us and our activities, whether true or not. Although we believe that we operate in a manner that is respectful to all stakeholders and
that we take care in protecting our image and reputation, we do not ultimately have direct control over how we are perceived by others.
Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and
an impediment to our overall ability to advance our projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on financial performance, financial
condition, cash flows and growth prospects.</p><div>

Sarbanes-Oxley, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform, and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq, and other applicable
securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective
disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. We will have to hire additional accounting, finance, and other personnel
in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company and our management and other personnel devote
a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These requirements will increase our legal and financial
compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations,
in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is
provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs
necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.&#160;</p><div>

as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and Nasdaq to implement provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley, impose significant requirements
on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate
governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted
additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory &#8220;say on pay&#8221; voting requirements that are applicable to
us. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform
may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">We are an early-stage psychotropics
contract manufacturing company focused on becoming the premier contract research, development, and manufacturing organization for the
emerging psychotropics-based medicines industry. In August 2021, Health Canada&#8217;s Office of Controlled Substances granted us a Controlled
Drugs and Substances Dealer&#8217;s Licence under Part J of the Food and Drug Regulations promulgated under the Food and Drugs Act (Canada),
or a Dealer&#8217;s Licence. A Dealer&#8217;s Licence authorizes us to develop, sell, deliver, and manufacture (through extraction or
synthesis) certain pharmaceutical-grade active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in controlled substances and their raw material
precursors. Our mission is to make our products and research services available to our clients for the development of medicines and experimental
therapies to address certain psychiatric health disorders and other medical needs. Since current Canadian regulations prohibit the commercial
sales of APIs and other products we intend to produce, APIs and such other products would only be authorized for sale in Canada for clinical
testing purposes in an &#8220;institution,&#8221; for the purpose of determining the hazards and efficacy of the drug, and for laboratory
research in an institution by qualified investigators. Our mission is to make our products and research services available to our clients
for the development of medicines and experimental therapies to address certain psychiatric health disorders and other medical needs. We
cannot guarantee that we will receive such further approvals from Health Canada, and a failure to receive such further approvals would
have a material adverse effect on our business and result in an inability to generate revenue from said substances. Further, as of the
date of this Annual Report, we have not manufactured all of the psychedelics-based products allowable under the Dealer&#8217;s Licence.</p><div>
</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">&#160;</p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The success of our
business plan is dependent on our activities being permissible under applicable laws and upon the occurrence of regulatory changes
for psychotropics-based medicines. In Canada, the psychedelic compounds that we are approved to produce under our Dealer&#8217;s
Licence, psilocybin, psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, or N,N-DMT, and
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA, and 4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxybenzeneethanamine, or 2C-B, are regulated under the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act, or CDSA. Certain psychedelic substances, including psilocybin, psilocin, mescaline and DMT, are classified
as Schedule III drugs and the CDSA prohibits the possession of a Schedule III drug absent authorization under the CDSA or a related
regulation, and are illegal to possess Schedule III substances without a prescription. In the United States, these substances are
classified under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. &#167; 811), or the CSA, and the Controlled Substances Import and Export
Act, or the CSIEA, and as such, medical and recreational use is illegal under the U.S. federal laws. Under the CSA, the Drug
Enforcement Agency, or DEA, regulates chemical compounds with a potential for abuse as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances.
Schedule I substances may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Most, if not all, state laws in the United
States classify psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT and 2C-B as Schedule I controlled substances. For any product containing any of these
substances to be available for commercial marketing in the United States, the applicable substance must be rescheduled, or the
product itself must be scheduled, by the DEA to Schedule II, III, IV or V. If the DEA does not reschedule psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT
and 2C-B as II, III, IV or V, such substances will be subject to individually-allotted manufacturing and procurement quotas, which
may have a material adverse effect on our business and result in an inability to generate sufficient revenue from said substances to
be profitable. Additionally, regardless of the scheduling of a finished, approved therapeutic product, if the API used in the final
dosage form is a Schedule I or II controlled substance, it would be subject to such quotas as the API could remain listed on
Schedule I or II. Moreover, even if the finished dosage form of a psychedelics-based medicine developed by one of our clients is
approved by the FDA, and if such product is listed by the DEA as a Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance, its manufacture,
importation, exportation, domestic distribution, storage, sale and legitimate use will continue to be subject to a significant
degree of regulation by the DEA.</p><div>

date, we have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of our common shares, convertible and non-convertible promissory

incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from our operations. Our operations have been financed primarily by the sale and issuance
of our common shares, from the issuance of convertible and non-convertible promissory notes, and our IPO. We will continue to be dependent
upon equity and debt financings or collaborations or other forms of capital at least until we are able to generate positive cash flows
from product sales, if ever.</p><div>

$8,687,029 for the year ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $44,415,798 and cash of $1,673,874.
The gross proceeds from the IPO were $7.5 million and the net proceeds were approximately $5.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and other offering related expenses payable by the Company. Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which
consist primarily of selling, general and administrative expenditures and expenditures for research and development activities when liquidity
permits. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in accounts
payable and accrued expenses. Our strategy for managing liquidity over the long-term is based on achieving positive cash flows from operations
to internally fund operating and capital requirements. We continually monitor factors that may affect our liquidity. These factors include
research and development costs, operating costs, capital costs, income tax refunds, foreign currency fluctuations, seasonality, market
immaturity and a highly fluid environment related to state and federal law passage and regulations.</p><div>

and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based
on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.</p><div>

value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires inputs based
on certain subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected stock price volatility, (b) the calculation of expected term of the
award, (c) the risk-free interest rate and (d) expected dividends. Due to the historical lack of a public market for our common
stock and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on
the historical volatility of a group of similar companies that are publicly traded. The historical volatility is calculated based on
a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of a representative group of companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development and
life science industry focus. We use the simplified method as allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Staff
Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do
not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free
interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the share purchase options. The
expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our
common stock. The fair value of stock-based payments is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is generally
the vesting period.</p><div>

to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilized.
This is deemed to be the case when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the
same taxable entity which are expected to reverse in the same year as the expected reversal of the deductible temporary difference, or
in years into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward. However, utilization of the tax losses
also depends on the ability of the taxable entity to satisfy certain tests at the time the losses are recouped.</p><div>

assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing

Procedures</i></b></p><div>

</div><p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in; ">Our
management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal
financial and accounting officer), do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent
all error and all fraud. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments
in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented
by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of
any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that
any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations
in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management necessarily was required to apply
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.</p><div>

our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions
regarding required disclosures, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#8217;s

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by
our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets
of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management
and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the Company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p><div>

conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control
- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023 due to the material weaknesses identified

of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated
can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control system&#8217;s objectives will be met. The design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.</p><div>

$20&#160;billion and market capitalization from $3&#160;billion to more than $40&#160;billion. Upon leaving Disney, Nanula joined Starwood
Hotels and Resorts, serving as the company&#8217;s President and Chief Operating Officer from 1998 to 2000. During this time, he led
the integration of Starwood Hotels, Westin, and Sheraton ITT into a single $20&#160;billion enterprise, forming the largest hospitality

current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board
of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our shares by each non-employee
director, and the transactions involving them described in the section titled &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.&#8221;
Mr. Nanula is not considered independent by virtue of his position as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr.&#160;Reeves is not considered
independent because the law firm in which he serves as a partner, Tingle Merrett LLP, in the current or any of the past three fiscal
years has received compensation in excess of the greater of 5% of the firm&#8217;s gross revenues or $200,000 with respect to legal services

as may be determined in the sole discretion of our board of directors. Additionally, the Board expects to grant to Mr. Nanula under the
2021 Plan, a stock option to purchase 668,836 common shares. The exercise price of this stock option will be $2.99. This stock option

interest, as determined by the audit committee of our board of directors, including, without limitation, purchases of goods or services

balance sheets of Lucy Scientific Discovery Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders&#8217; deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30,
2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted

have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has historically
had significant negative operating cash flows and net losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its
operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. Management&#8217;s plans in
regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p><div>

standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged
to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.</p><div>

the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p><div>

statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge
its liabilities in the normal course of business. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial
support from its management, its ability to identify future investment opportunities, to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing,
generating profitable operations from the Company&#8217;s future operations or the success of an initial public offering. These factors
raise substantial doubt regarding the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern during the next twelve months. These consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.</p></ix:continuation><div>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The lease liability relates
to a warehouse leased by the Company (the &#8220;Warehouse Lease&#8221;). The lease commenced on August 1, 2017 with an initial term of
<ix:nonNumeric contextRef="c46" format="ixt-sec:duryear" name="lsdi:InitialTermYears">5</ix:nonNumeric> years expiring on <ix:nonNumeric contextRef="c46" format="ixt:date-monthname-day-year-en" name="us-gaap:LeaseExpirationDate1">July 31, 2022</ix:nonNumeric>. On August 1, 2022, the Company exercised its option to renew for <ix:nonNumeric contextRef="c47" format="ixt-sec:duryear" name="lsdi:OptionToRenew">5</ix:nonNumeric> years. The new term starts on August
1, 2022 and ends on July 31, 2027, with an option to extend the lease for an additional <ix:nonNumeric contextRef="c47" format="ixt-sec:durwordsen" name="lsdi:OptionToExtend">five years</ix:nonNumeric>. The renewal option needs to be exercised
no less than six months from the expiry date. As of lease renewal, the Company anticipated exercising the option to renew and as such
has determined the lease term to be <ix:nonNumeric contextRef="c3" format="ixt-sec:duryear" name="us-gaap:LesseeOperatingLeaseRemainingLeaseTerm">10</ix:nonNumeric> years in determining the lease liability. The discount rate used was <ix:nonFraction contextRef="c3" decimals="2" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" name="us-gaap:LesseeFinanceLeaseDiscountRate" scale="-2" unitRef="pure">16</ix:nonFraction>%, equivalent to the interest
rate the Company would incur to borrow funds equal to the future lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term and in a
similar economic environment. As a result, the Company increased its right-of-use asset by $<ix:nonFraction contextRef="c3" decimals="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" name="lsdi:OperatingLeaseRightOfUseAssets" scale="0" unitRef="usd">1,144,349</ix:nonFraction> and lease liability by $<ix:nonFraction contextRef="c3" decimals="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" name="lsdi:leaseLiability" scale="0" unitRef="usd">1,144,349</ix:nonFraction>
related to the Warehouse Lease on August 1, 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded amortization expense of $<ix:nonFraction contextRef="c0" decimals="0" format="ixt:num-dot-decimal" name="us-gaap:AdjustmentForAmortization" scale="0" unitRef="usd">101,466</ix:nonFraction>
(year ended June 30, 2022- $<span style="-sec-ix-hidden: hidden-fact-205">nil</span>) with respect to the right of use asset.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company has computed the
fair value of share purchase options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected term used for options issued to
non-employees is the contractual life and the expected term used for options issued to employees and directors is the estimated period
of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The Company utilizes the &#8220;simplified&#8221; method to develop an estimate
of the expected term of &#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; employee share purchase option grants. The Company is utilizing an expected volatility
figure based on a review of the historical volatilities, over a period of time, equivalent to the expected life of the instrument being
valued, of similarly positioned public companies within its industry. The risk-free interest rate was determined from the implied yields
from U.S.&#160;Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a remaining term consistent with the expected term of the instrument being valued.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in">The Company must make judgements
as to the realization of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon a variety of factors, including the generation of future taxable
income, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. To the extent that the Company believes that recovery is
not likely, it must establish a valuation allowance. A&#160;valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which the
Company does not believe meet the &#8220;more likely than not&#8221; criteria. The Company&#8217;s judgments regarding future taxable
income may change due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If the Company&#8217;s
assumptions and consequently its estimates change in the future, the valuation allowances it has established may be increased or decreased,
resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense. Based upon the Company&#8217;s historical operating losses and the
uncertainty of future taxable income, the Company has provided a valuation allowance primarily against its deferred tax assets up to the
deferred tax liabilities, as of June&#160;30, 2023 and 2022.</p>
