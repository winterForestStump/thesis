    "content": "Item 1.Business.\nIntroduction\nWe are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the business combination). We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a shell company as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.\nOn March 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the initial public offering) of 50,000,000 units (the units), including the issuance of 6,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (Class A common stock) and one-third of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $500 million.\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the private placement) of an aggregate of 7,133,333 warrants (the private placement warrants) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $10,700,000.\nPrior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on January 11, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares (the founder shares) of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (Class B common stock) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On February 18, 2021, we effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,493,750 founder shares. On February 25, 2021, we effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Companys Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 founder shares. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 founder shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 founder shares.\nA total of $500,000,000, comprised of $491,300,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $18,800,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) and $8,700,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the trust account) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.\nThe funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $506,713,948 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes $6,713,948 of interest income, and approximately $3,773 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2022, we had withdrawn $332,505 interest earned from the trust account.\nEffecting Our Initial Business Combination\nGeneral\nWe are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until the consummation of our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the trust account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.\nIf our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.\nSelection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination\nWhile we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, we intend to concentrate our efforts identifying businesses in the financial services industry with an enterprise value of approximately $1.5 billion to $5.0 billion, with particular emphasis on businesses that are providing or changing technology for traditional financial services (FinTech), those in the wealth, investment and asset management sectors, or certain types of technology companies that lie adjacent to the FinTech sector. Such companies might include those providing artificial intelligence, information, data and analytics, tech-enabled services, risk, and compliance solutions, including those focused on financial, regulatory, fraud and cybersecurity risk, and/or enterprise software solutions, among others. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire, and manage a business in the FinTech and financial services industries that can benefit from their experience and differentiated global network. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on February 25, 2021 and March 1, 2023, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation) prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the targets assets or prospects.\nWe anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.\nIn evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews, and other reviews as we deem appropriate.\nThe time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor, our officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nRedemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of the initial business combination\nWe will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.\nConduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules\nIf we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.\nSubmission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote\nIn the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted in favor of the initial business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering, in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of our securities our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\nThe purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nLimitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval\nNotwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holders shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor, or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination.\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that we have only 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or March 2, 2023 to complete our initial business combination.\nOn February 28, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the February Special Meeting), at which our stockholders approved the proposals presented to them to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date in which we have to complete a business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023, (ii) allow our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up the Companys operations on a date earlier than the Extended Date and (iii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of our initial business combination.\nOn September 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the \"September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date in which we have to consummate an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 (such date, the \"Extended Date\") and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A common stock such that it would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.\nIf we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Extended Date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.\nEmployees\nWe currently have two executive officers: John James and Erik Thoresen. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 28, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the February Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the February Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023 and permit our board of directors in its sole discretion to wind up our operations on an earlier date as determined by them and included in a public announcement and (ii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock with the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the closing of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder. In connection with the February Special Meeting, stockholders holding 45,524,677 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of January 25, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $463.4 million (approximately $10.18 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $45.6 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 16,975,323 shares of common stock outstanding, which includes 4,475,323 shares of Class A common stock and 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock. In connection with the February Special Meeting, on March 1, 2023, we filed the February Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nBetween August 25, 2023 and August 31, 2023, we and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the Non-Redemption Agreements) with unaffiliated third party investors (the NRA Investors), pursuant to which the NRA Investors have agreed, in connection with the September Special Meeting (as defined below), to not redeem, or to reverse and revoke any prior redemption election, with respect to 2,105,697 shares of Class A common stock held by them and the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the NRA Investors an aggregate of 471,424 founder shares. The foregoing description of the Non-Redemption Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Non-Redemption Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.10.\nOn August 29, 2023, in accordance with our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Sponsor elected to convert 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock held by it into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAlso on August 29, 2023, the Company and Sponsor entered into a subscription agreement (the Polar Subscription Agreement) with Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund (Polar), an unaffiliated third party of the Company, pursuant to which Polar agrees to make certain capital contributions (the Polar Capital Contribution) from time to time, at the request of the Sponsor, subject to the terms and conditions of the Polar Subscription Agreement, to the Sponsor to meet the Sponsors commitment to fund our working capital needs. In exchange for the commitment of Polar to provide the Polar Capital Contribution, (i) we will issue shares of Class A common stock to Polar at the closing of our initial business combination; and (ii) upon repayment of working capital loans by the Company, the Sponsor will return the Investor Capital Contribution at the closing of an initial business combination. In exchange for the forgoing commitment of Polar to make capital contributions to the Sponsor, we agreed to, or cause the surviving entity following the closing of our initial business combination to, issue one share of Class A common stock for each dollar of the Investor Capital Contribution funded by Polar at the time of the closing of our initial business combination. We granted certain registration rights, as described in the Polar Subscription Agreement, with respect to such shares. The foregoing description of the Polar Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Polar Subscription Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.11.\nOn September 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the September Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A Common Stock such that it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. In connection with the September Special Meeting, stockholders holding 2,280,576 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of August 14, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $24.2 million (approximately $10.60 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $23.3 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 14,694,747 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which includes 2,194,747 public shares and 12,500,000 founder shares. In connection with the September Special Meeting, on September 1, 2023, we filed the September Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nIn addition, on October 18, 2023, the NYSE notified us, and publicly announced, that the staff of NYSE Regulation determined to suspend trading immediately and commence proceedings to delist our units and shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual because we had fallen below the NYSE's continued listing standard requiring a listed acquisition company to maintain an average aggregate global market capitalization attributable to its publicly-held shares over a consecutive thirty-trading day period of at least $40 million. We expect such securities to trade over-the-counter.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and are required to disclose certain material events in a Current Report on Form 8-K. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The SECs Internet website is located at www.sec.gov. In addition, the Company will provide copies of these documents without charge upon request from us in writing at 667 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY or by telephone at (212) 763-0619 or on our website at https://www.fusionacq.com/. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\n\u25cf Our stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, and even if we hold a vote, holders of our founder shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.\n\u25cf Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\n\u25cf If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\n\u25cf The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\n\u25cf The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\n\u25cf The requirement that we complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024 may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.\n\u25cf Our search for a business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and the status of debt and equity markets.\n\u25cf We may not be able to complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\n\u25cf If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors, and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or public warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A common stock.\n\u25cf If a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\n\u25cf You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\n\u25cf Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\n\u25cf If the net proceeds of the initial public offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least until March 2, 2024, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\n\u25cf Past performance by our management team and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\n\u25cf You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\n\u25cf The NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\n\u25cf Unlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our initial stockholders will receive additional shares of Class A common stock if we issue certain shares to consummate an initial business combination.\n\u25cf Our warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.\n\u25cf We may face litigation and other risks as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\n\u25cf Our independent registered public accounting firms report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, due to liquidity concerns and since we will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by March 2, 2024.\nRisks Relating to our Search for, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination\nOur stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, and even if we hold a vote, holders of our founder shares will participate in such vote, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination.\nWe may choose not to hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination if the business combination would not require stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. Even if we seek stockholder approval, the holders of our founder shares will participate in the vote on such approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders do not approve of the business combination we complete.\nYour only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash.\nAt the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of our initial business combination. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking stockholder approval, public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such stockholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding our initial business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial stockholders and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public stockholders vote.\nOur initial stockholders owned 20% of our outstanding common stock immediately following the completion of the initial public offering. Our initial stockholders and management team also may from time to time purchase Class A common stock prior to our initial business combination. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, if we seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial business combination will be approved if we receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at such meeting, including the founder shares. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders founder shares, we would need 18,750,000, or 37.5%, of the 50,000,000 public shares sold in the initial public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted, and the over-allotment option is not exercised). Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial stockholders and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite stockholder approval for such initial business combination.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target.\nWe may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with minimum cash requirement for (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, as further described in our Form 10-Q for the period from January 11, 2021, to September 30, 2021. Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or make us unable to satisfy a minimum cash condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nAt the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares is submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provision of the Class B common stock results in the issues of shares of Class A common stock on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the shares of Class B common stock at the time of our initial business combination. In addition, the amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure.\nThe ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares.\nIf our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with your exercise of redemption rights until we liquidate, or you are able to sell your shares in the open market.\nThe requirement that we complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024, may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets, in particular as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders.\nAny potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation.\nWe may not be able to complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate.\nWe may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or public warrants from public stockholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our Class A common stock.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the NYSE rules. However, other than as expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.\nIn the event that our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.\nIn addition, if such purchases are made, the public float of our Class A common stock or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.\nIf a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed.\nWe will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or submit public shares for redemption. For example, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name, to, at the holders option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent, or to deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these, or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been selected, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if the initial public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination.\nBecause of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe expect to encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar or greater technical, human and other resources to ours or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a stockholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nIf the net proceeds of the initial public offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least until March 2, 2024, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination.\nOf the net proceeds of the initial public offering, only $1,000,000 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate until at least the Extended Date; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a no-shop provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.00 per share.\nOur placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third-party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to us and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if management believes that such third partys engagement would be in the best interests of the company under the circumstances. The underwriters of the initial public offering as well as our registered independent public accounting firm will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account.\nExamples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the initial public offering registration statement, our Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our Sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some, or all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including\n\u25cf registration as an investment company with the SEC;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations that we are not subject to.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading investment securities constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.\nWe do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. The initial public offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date; and (iii) absent an initial business combination by the Extended Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.\nUnder the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by March 2, 2024, may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 24th month from the closing of the initial public offering in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the foregoing procedures.\nBecause we do not comply with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution.\nWe may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination, which could delay the opportunity for our stockholders to elect directors.\nIn accordance with the NYSEs corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. Under Section 211(b) of the DGCL, we are, however, required to hold an annual meeting of stockholders for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with our bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, and thus we may not be in compliance with Section 211(b) of the DGCL, which requires an annual meeting. Therefore, if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the Delaware Court of Chancery in accordance with Section 211(c) of the DGCL.\nBecause we are not limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations.\nOur efforts to identify a prospective initial business combination target will not be limited to a particular industry, sector or geographic region. While we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire and operate a business or businesses that can benefit from our management teams established global relationships and operating experience. Our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing strategic investments globally and has done so successfully in a number of sectors. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet selected any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nWe may seek business combination opportunities in industries or sectors that may be outside of our managements areas of expertise.\nWe will consider a business combination outside of our managements areas of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive business combination opportunity for our company. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in the initial public offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue a business combination outside of the areas of our managements expertise, our managements expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained in this Form 10-K regarding the areas of our managements expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to ascertain or assess adequately all of the relevant risk factors. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines.\nAlthough we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from a valuation or appraisal firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view.\nUnless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity or our board of directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or from a valuation or appraisal firm that the price we are paying is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to our initial business combination.\nWe may issue additional shares of Class A common stock or shares of preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 280,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. There are 230,000,000 and 7,500,000 authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants or shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock is automatically convertible into Class A common stock concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination, initially at a one-for-one ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein and in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. There are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock or shares of preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue shares of Class A common stock upon conversion of the Class B common stock at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth therein. However, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares (a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (x) extend the time we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering or (y) amend the foregoing provisions. These provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in the initial public offering;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of Class A common stock is issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A common stock and/or warrants.\nOn February 28, 2023, we held the Meeting, at which our stockholders approved the proposals presented to them to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date in which we have to complete a business combination to the Extended Date, (ii) allow our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up the Companys operations on a date earlier than the Extended Date and (iii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of our initial business combination.\nResources could be wasted in researching business combinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless.\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination.\nIn recent years, the number of special purpose acquisition companies has increased substantially. A number of potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already been acquired, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies pursuing an initial business combination. As a result, fewer attractive targets may be available to consummate an initial business combination. In addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for targets may increase and, as a result, the terms of business combination transactions with available targets could become less favorable to us. Attractive transactions could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to us.\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest.\nIn light of the involvement of our Sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our Sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nSince our Sponsor, executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after the initial public offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nOn January 11, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain of our offering costs in exchange for 8,625,000 founder shares, or approximately $0.003 per share. On February 18, 2021, we effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,493,750 founder shares. On February 25, 2021, we effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Companys Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 founder shares. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 founder shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 founder shares. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the Sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The purchase price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued.\nThe number of founder shares outstanding was determined based on the expectation that the total size of the initial public offering would be a maximum of 50,025,000 units if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full, and therefore that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the initial public offering. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, our Sponsor has purchased an aggregate of 7,133,333 private placement warrants, each exercisable for one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $10,700,000, or $1.50 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial business combination. The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination, and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary of the closing of the initial public offering nears, which is the deadline for our completion of an initial business combination.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders investment in us.\nAlthough we have no commitments as of the date of this Form 10-K to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following the initial public offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25cf default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25cf acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25cf our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n\u25cf our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt is outstanding;\n\u25cf our inability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock;\n\u25cf using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A common stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nWe may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nThe net proceeds from the initial public offering and the private placement of warrants provided us with $481,200,000 that we may use to complete our initial business combination (after taking into account the $18,800,000 of deferred underwriting commissions being held in the trust account).\nWe may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive, and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\n\u25cf solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset, or\n\u25cf dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination.\nWe may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability.\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nWe may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nIn pursuing our business combination strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders or warrant holders do not agree.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001, as further described in our Form 10-Q for the period from January 11, 2021, to September 30, 2021. In addition, our proposed initial business combination may impose a minimum cash requirement for: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our Sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares in connection with such initial business combination, all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.\nIn order to effectuate an initial business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders may not support.\nIn order to effectuate a business combination, special purpose acquisition companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, special purpose acquisition companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation will require the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock and amending our warrant agreement will require a vote of holders of at least 50% of the public warrants and, solely with respect to any amendment to the terms of the private placement warrants or any provision of the warrant agreement with respect to the private placement warrants, 50% of the number of the then outstanding private placement warrants. In addition, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination by the Extended Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of the securities offered through this registration statement, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments or extend the time to consummate an initial business combination in order to effectuate our initial business combination.\nThe provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other special purpose acquisition companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon. If we amend such provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting. In all other instances, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon, subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficially own 20% of our common stock upon the closing of initial public offering, may participate in any vote to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other special purpose acquisition companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nOur Sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to written agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our Sponsor, executive officers, directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law.\nCertain agreements related to the initial public offering may be amended without stockholder approval.\nEach of the agreements related to the initial public offering to which we are a party, other than the warrant agreement and the investment management trust agreement, may be amended without stockholder approval. Such agreements are: the underwriting agreement; the letter agreement among us and our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors; the registration rights agreement among us and our initial stockholders; the private placement warrants purchase agreement between us and our Sponsor; and the administrative services agreement among us, our Sponsor and an affiliate of our Sponsor. These agreements contain various provisions that our public stockholders might deem to be material. For example, our letter agreement and the underwriting agreement contain certain lock-up provisions with respect to the founder shares, private placement warrants, and other securities held by our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors. Amendments to such agreements would require the consent of the applicable parties thereto and would need to be approved by our board of directors, which may do so for a variety of reasons, including to facilitate our initial business combination. While we do not expect our board of directors to approve any amendment to any of these agreements prior to our initial business combination, it may be possible that our board of directors, in exercising its business judgment and subject to its fiduciary duties, chooses to approve one or more amendments to any such agreement. Any amendment entered into in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, related to such initial business combination, and any other material amendment to any of our material agreements will be disclosed in a filing with the SEC. Any such amendments would not require approval from our stockholders, may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible, and may have an adverse effect on the value of an investment in our securities. For example, amendments to the lock-up provision discussed above may result in our initial stockholders selling their securities earlier than they would otherwise be permitted, which may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination.\nWe have not selected any specific business combination target but intend to target businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants. As a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemption by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. Further, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, or to fund the purchase of other companies. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public stockholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination.\nOur initial stockholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support.\nOur initial stockholders own 20% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Neither our initial stockholders nor, to our knowledge, any of our officers or directors, have any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this Form 10-K and the initial public offering registration statement. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our Sponsor, is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term for three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial business combination.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses.\nThe federal proxy rules require that the proxy statement with respect to the vote on an initial business combination include historical and pro forma financial statement disclosure. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB). These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an initial business combination.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with this Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.\nRisks Relating to the Post Business Combination Company\nSubsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nEven if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partially finance the initial business combination or thereafter. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nThe officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination targets key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nThe role of an acquisition candidates key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidates management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place.\nOur management may not maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.\nWe may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the companys shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business.\nWe may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.\nWhen evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources, or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target businesss management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications, or abilities we suspected. Should the target businesss management not possess the skills, qualifications, or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders or warrant holders who choose to remain stockholders or warrant holders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders or warrant holders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.\nRisks Relating to Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries\nIf we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may adversely affect us.\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nIf we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following:\n\u25cf costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations;\n\u25cf rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;\n\u25cf complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\n\u25cf laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected;\n\u25cf exchange listing and/or delisting requirements;\n\u25cf tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u25cf regulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u25cf local or regional economic policies and market conditions;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf challenges in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf tax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\n\u25cf currency fluctuations and exchange controls;\n\u25cf rates of inflation;\n\u25cf challenges in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf employment regulations;\n\u25cf underdeveloped or unpredictable legal or regulatory systems;\n\u25cf corruption;\n\u25cf protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf social unrest, crime, strikes, riots and civil disturbances;\n\u25cf regime changes and political upheaval;\n\u25cf terrorist attacks and wars; and\n\u25cf deterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such initial business combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Sponsor and Management Team\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business.\nOur ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnels retention or resignation a condition to agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law.\nOur executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination. Each of our executive officers is engaged in several other business endeavors for which he may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination.\nOur officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nWe intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation.\nIn addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors or executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nThe personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors and officers discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Delaware law and we or our stockholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our stockholders rights. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers.\nWe have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nRisks Relating to our Securities\nYou will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those shares of Class A common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by the Extension Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In addition, if our plan to redeem our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination by the Extension Date is not completed for any reason, compliance with Delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our then-existing stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account. In that case, public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond the Extension Date before they receive funds from our trust account. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nThe NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur units and Class A common stock are listed on the NYSE. We cannot assure you that our securities will be, or will continue to be, listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum average global market capitalization and a minimum number of holders of our securities. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSEs initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSEs continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our global market capitalization would be required to be at least $150 million, the aggregate market value of our publicly-held shares would be required to be at least $40 million and we would be required to have a minimum of 400 round lot holders and 1,100,000 publicly held shares. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our Class A common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A common stock and warrants will be listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A common stock and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute, and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nOn November 10, 2022, the NYSE notified us, and publicly announced, that the NYSE determined to commence proceedings to delist the our warrants from the NYSE and that trading in the warrants would be suspended immediately, due to abnormally low trading price levels pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\nUnlike some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies, our initial stockholders will receive additional shares of Class A common stock if we issue certain shares to consummate an initial business combination.\nThe founder shares will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with our initial business combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of shares of Class A common stock by public stockholders), including the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial business combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued to our Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of working capital loans, provided that such conversion of founder shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis. This is different than some other similarly structured special purpose acquisition companies in which the initial stockholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to our initial business combination.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a group of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 15% of our Class A common stock.\nIf we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in initial public offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the Excess Shares. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell your shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss.\nProvisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of Class A common stock and could entrench management.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval.\nOur warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock (at a ratio different than initially provided), shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of Class A common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant.\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law: (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. The warrant agreement also provides that we will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction or that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an enforcement action) and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holders counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption. We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.\nYou will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the underlying Class A common stock or certain exemptions are available.\nIf the issuance of the Class A common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A common stock included in the units.\nUnder the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a post-effective amendment to the initial public offering registration statement or a new registration statement covering the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 60 business days following our initial business combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order.\nIf the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, under the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do so for cash and, instead, will be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\nIn no event will warrants be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration or qualification is available.\nIf our shares of Class A common stock are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of covered securities under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, not permit holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants to do so for cash and, instead, require them to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act; in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement or register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws, and in the event we do not so elect, we will use our best efforts to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nIn no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws.\nYou may only be able to exercise your public warrants on a cashless basis under certain circumstances, and if you do so, you will receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.\nThe warrant agreement provides that in the following circumstances holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do for cash and will, instead, be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act: (i) if the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreement; (ii) if we have so elected and the shares of Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of covered securities under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act; and (iii) if we have so elected and we call the public warrants for redemption. If you exercise your public warrants on a cashless basis, you would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of our shares of Class A common stock (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value is the average reported closing price of the shares of Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.\nThe grant of registration rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our shares of Class A common stock.\nPursuant to an agreement that was entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in initial public offering, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the shares of Class A common stock into which founder shares are convertible, holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register such warrants or the Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of such warrants. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares and the private placement warrants and the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake, they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock that is expected when the shares of common stock owned by our initial stockholders, holders of our private placement warrants or holders of our working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered.\nOur warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of Class A common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase 16,166,667 shares of our Class A common stock as part of the units offered by the initial public offering. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 7,133,333 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at $11.50 per share. In addition, if our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or certain of our officers and directors makes any working capital loans, such lender may convert those loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 private placement warrants, at the price of $1.50 per warrant. To the extent we issue common stock to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and reduce the value of the Class A common stock issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business.\nBecause each unit contains one-third of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other special purpose acquisition companies.\nEach unit contains one-third of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of Class A common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one common share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for one-third of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) (the SEC Statement). Specifically, the SEC Statement focused on certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers following a business combination, which terms are similar to those contained in the warrant agreement governing our warrants. As a result of the SEC Statement, we reevaluated the accounting treatment of our 16,666,667 public warrants and 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants and determined to classify the warrants as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings.\nAs a result, included on our condensed balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022 contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K are derivative liabilities related to our warrants. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statements of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our unaudited condensed financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors, which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares. In addition, potential targets may seek a special purpose acquisition company that does not have warrants that are accounted for as liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through the initial public offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues.\nPast performance by our management team and their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nInformation regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, our management team or businesses associated with them is presented for informational purposes only. The past performance of our management team or their respective affiliates, including with respect to Fusion Acquisition Corp. (Fusion I), is not a guarantee of either: (i) success with respect to any business combination we may consummate; or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Other than Fusion I, no member of our management team has had management experience with special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. You should not rely on the historical record of our management teams or their respective affiliates performance as indicative of any future performance.\nCyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nProvisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any claim (A) as to which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. If an action is brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholders counsel.\nAlthough we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Additionally, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal courts shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or agents. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. We note, however, that there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce these exclusive forum provisions and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe this provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers.\nWe have no operating history and are subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement if we do not complete an initial business combination by March 2, 2024. As such, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern if we do not consummate an initial business combination by the applicable deadline. If we are unable to effect an initial business combination by the deadline, we will be forced to liquidate.\nWe are a blank check company, and as we have no operating history and are subject to a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution requirement, there is a risk that we will be unable to continue as a going concern if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Companys warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. To mitigate the risk of that result, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our Initial Public Offering, we may instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company to liquidate the securities held in the trust account and instead hold all funds in the trust account in cash. As a result, following such change, we will likely receive minimal, if any, interest, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount that our public shareholders would have otherwise received upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company if the assets in the trust account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds.\nOn March 30, 2022, the SEC issued proposed rules (the SPAC Rule Proposals), relating, among other things, to circumstances in which SPACs such as us could potentially be subject to the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. The SPAC Rule Proposals would provide a safe harbor for such companies from the definition of investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, provided that a SPAC satisfies certain criteria. To comply with the duration limitation of the proposed safe harbor, a SPAC would have a limited time period to announce and complete a de-SPAC transaction. Specifically, to comply with the safe harbor, the SPAC Rule Proposals would require a company to file a report on Form 8-K announcing that it has entered into an agreement with a target company for an initial business combination no later than 18 months after the effective date of the registration statement for its initial public offering. The company would then be required to complete its initial business combination no later than 30 months after the effective date of the registration statement for its initial public offering. We understand that the SEC has recently been taking informal positions regarding the Investment Company Act consistent with the SPAC Rule Proposals.\nThere is currently uncertainty concerning the applicability of the Investment Company Act to a SPAC, including a company like ours, that does not complete its initial business combination within the proposed time frame set forth in the proposed safe harbor rule. As indicated above, we completed our Initial Public Offering in March 2, 2021 and have operated as a blank check company searching for a target business with which to consummate an initial business combination since such time (or approximately twenty-four months after the effective date of our IPO, as of the date of this Form 10-K). If we were deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we might be forced to abandon our efforts to complete an initial business combination and instead be required to liquidate the Company. If we are required to liquidate the Company, our investors would not be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the value of our shares and warrants following such a transaction, and our warrants would expire worthless.\nThe funds in the trust account have, since our Initial Public Offering, been held only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. As of December 31, 2022, amounts held in trust account included approximately $1,779,000 of accrued interest. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to have been operating as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may, on or prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our Initial Public Offering, or February 2, 2023, instruct Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the trust account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the trust account and thereafter to hold all funds in the trust account in cash (i.e., in one or more bank accounts) until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or our liquidation. Following such liquidation of the assets in our trust account, we will likely receive minimal interest, if any, on the funds held in the trust account, which would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would have otherwise received upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company if the assets in the trust account had remained in U.S. government securities or money market funds. This means that the amount available for redemption will not increase in the future.\nIn addition, even prior to the 24-month anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement relating to our Initial Public Offering, we may be deemed to be an investment company. The longer that the funds in the trust account are held in short-term U.S. government securities or in money market funds invested exclusively in such securities, even prior to the 24-month anniversary, there is a greater risk that we may be considered an unregistered investment company, in which case we may be required to liquidate. Accordingly, we may determine, in our discretion, to liquidate the securities held in the trust account at any time, even prior to the 24-month anniversary, and instead hold all funds in the trust account in cash, which would further reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or our liquidation.\nA new 1% U.S. federal excise tax could be imposed on us in connection with redemptions by us of our shares or our liquidation.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act), which, among other things, imposes a new 1% U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by covered corporations (which include publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations) beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the Excise Tax). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which the stock is repurchased. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities are trading on the NYSE, we are a covered corporation for this purpose. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the Excise Tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax; however, no guidance has been issued to date. It is uncertain whether, and/or to what extent, the Excise Tax could apply to any repurchase by us of our common stock or in the event of our liquidation, in each instance after December 31, 2022, including any redemptions in connection with an initial business combination or in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination by the Extended Date.\nWhether and to what extent we would be subject to the Excise Tax on a redemption of our shares of Class A common stock or other stock issued by us would depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock in connection with our initial business combination, an extension or otherwise (iii) the structure of the initial business combination, (iv) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with the initial business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the initial business combination but issued within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock) and (v) the content of regulations and other guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As noted above, the Excise Tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder. The imposition of the Excise Tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete an initial business combination or for effecting redemptions and may affect our ability to complete an initial business combination. In addition, the Excise Tax could cause a reduction in the per share amount payable to our public stockholders in the event we liquidate the trust account due to a failure to complete an initial business combination within the requisite timeframe.\nWe may not be able to complete an initial business combination since such initial business combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements, including pursuant to foreign investment regulations and review by governmental entities such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), or may be ultimately prohibited.\nOur initial business combination may be subject to regulatory review and approval requirements by governmental entities, or ultimately prohibited. For example, CFIUS has authority to review certain direct or indirect foreign investments in U.S. businesses. Among other things, CFIUS is empowered to require mandatory filings related to certain foreign investments, to charge filing fees related to such filings, and to self-initiate national security reviews of foreign direct and indirect investments in U.S. businesses if the parties to that investment choose not to file voluntarily. If CFIUS determines that an investment threatens national security, CFIUS has the power to impose restrictions on the investment or recommend that the President prohibit it or order divestment. Whether CFIUS has jurisdiction to review an acquisition or investment transaction depends on, among other factors, the nature and structure of the transaction, the nationality of the parties, the level of beneficial ownership interest and the nature of any information or governance rights involved.\nOur Sponsor, Fusion Sponsor II LLC, is controlled by a non-U.S. person. John James, our Chief Executive Officer, is the managing member of our Sponsor and therefore ultimately has voting and dispositive power over the securities held directly by our Sponsor. Mr. James is a British and Australian citizen. Both Mr. James and our Sponsor are foreign persons that qualify as excepted investors under the CFIUS regulations. Excepted investors must meet specified qualifications related to countries that have been designated by CFIUS as excepted foreign states, which are Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Though excepted investors remain subject to CFIUSs general jurisdiction, they are exempt from certain expanded CFIUS authorities under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018.\nFor so long as the Sponsor retains a material ownership interest in us, we may be deemed a foreign person under the regulations relating to CFIUS. As such, an initial business combination with a U.S. business or foreign business with U.S. operations that we may wish to pursue may be subject to CFIUS review. If a particular proposed initial business combination with a U.S. business falls within CFIUSs jurisdiction, we may determine that we are required to make a mandatory filing or that we will submit to CFIUS review on a voluntary basis, or to proceed with the transaction without submitting to CFIUS and risk CFIUS intervention, before or after closing the transaction. In such circumstances, CFIUS may decide to delay or recommend that the President of the United States block our proposed initial business combination, require conditions with respect to such initial business combination or recommend that the President of the United States order us to divest all or a portion of the U.S. target business of our initial business combination that we acquired without first obtaining CFIUS approval, which may limit the attractiveness of, or delay or prevent us from pursuing, certain target companies that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, certain types of U.S. businesses may be subject to rules or regulations that limit or impose requirements with respect to foreign ownership.\nIf CFIUS determines it has jurisdiction, CFIUS may decide to recommend a block or delay our initial business combination, or require conditions with respect to it, which may delay or prevent us from consummating a potential transaction.\nThe process of government review, whether by CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy. Because we have only a limited time to complete our initial business combination, our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may require us to liquidate. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within the applicable time period required, including as a result of extended regulatory review, we will, as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account and as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our Board, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such event, our stockholders will miss the opportunity to benefit from an investment in a target company and the potential appreciation in value of such investment. Additionally, our warrants will become worthless.\nItem 2B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.  Item 2. Properties.\nOur executive offices are located at 667 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10065. Our executive offices are provided to us by an affiliate of the Sponsor, and we have agreed to pay such affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us or any of our officers or directors in their corporate capacity. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPart II Item 5. Market For Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters And Issuer Purchases Of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur units, Class A common stock and warrants are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols FSNB.U, FSNB and FSNB WS, respectively.\nHolders\nAs of October 31, 2023, there was one holder of record of our units, two holders of record of our Class A common stock and two holders of record of our warrants.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial conditions subsequent to completion of an initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to an initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Offerings\nIn January 11, 2021, we issued to the Sponsor an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000. On February 18, 2021, we effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,493,750 founder shares. On February 25, 2021, we effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Companys Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 founder shares. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 founder shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 founder shares. The foregoing issuance was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act).\nOn March 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 50,000,000 units. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating total gross proceeds of $500,000,000. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as sole book-running manager and Odeon Capital Group, LLC acted as co-manager, of the initial public offering. The securities sold in the offering were registered under the Securities Act on registration statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-252265). The SEC declared the registration statement effective on February 25, 2021.\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated a private placement of 7,133,333 private placement warrants to the Sponsor and underwriter at a price of $1.50 per warrant, generating total proceeds of $10,700,000. Such securities were issued pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.\nThe private placement warrants are the same as the warrants sold as part of the units sold in the initial public offering, held by Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by such holders until 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial business combination, (iii) may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis and (iv) will be entitled to registration rights.\nOf the gross proceeds received from the initial public offering and private placement of private placement warrants, $500,000,000 was placed in a trust account.\nWe paid a total of $8,700,000 in underwriting fees and approximately $619,847 for other costs and expenses related to the initial public offering. In addition, the underwriters agreed to defer $18,800,000 in underwriting fees. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of Operations.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on January 11, 2021 for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a business combination will be successful.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 28, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the February Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the February Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023 and permit our board of directors in its sole discretion to wind up our operations on an earlier date as determined by them and included in a public announcement and (ii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock with the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the closing of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder. In connection with the February Special Meeting, stockholders holding 45,524,677 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of January 25, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $463.4 million (approximately $10.18 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $45.6 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 16,975,323 shares of common stock outstanding, which includes 4,475,323 shares of Class A common stock and 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock. In connection with the February Special Meeting, on March 1, 2023, we filed the February Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nBetween August 25, 2023 and August 31, 2023, we and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the Non-Redemption Agreements) with unaffiliated third party investors (the NRA Investors), pursuant to which the NRA Investors have agreed, in connection with the September Special Meeting (as defined below), to not redeem, or to reverse and revoke any prior redemption election, with respect to 2,105,697 shares of Class A common stock held by them and the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the NRA Investors an aggregate of 471,424 founder shares. The foregoing description of the Non-Redemption Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Non-Redemption Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.10.\nOn August 29, 2023, in accordance with our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Sponsor elected to convert 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock held by it into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAlso on August 29, 2023, the Company and Sponsor entered into a subscription agreement (the Polar Subscription Agreement) with Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund (Polar), an unaffiliated third party of the Company, pursuant to which Polar agrees to make certain capital contributions (the Polar Capital Contribution) from time to time, at the request of the Sponsor, subject to the terms and conditions of the Polar Subscription Agreement, to the Sponsor to meet the Sponsors commitment to fund our working capital needs. In exchange for the commitment of Polar to provide the Polar Capital Contribution, (i) we will issue shares of Class A common stock to Polar at the closing of our initial business combination; and (ii) upon repayment of working capital loans by the Company, the Sponsor will return the Investor Capital Contribution at the closing of an initial business combination. In exchange for the forgoing commitment of Polar to make capital contributions to the Sponsor, we agreed to, or cause the surviving entity following the closing of our initial business combination to, issue one share of Class A common stock for each dollar of the Investor Capital Contribution funded by Polar at the time of the closing of our initial business combination. We granted certain registration rights, as described in the Polar Subscription Agreement, with respect to such shares. The foregoing description of the Polar Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Polar Subscription Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.11.\nOn September 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the September Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A Common Stock such that it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. In connection with the September Special Meeting, stockholders holding 2,280,576 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of August 14, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $24.2 million (approximately $10.60 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $23.3 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 14,694,747 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which includes 2,194,747 public shares and 12,500,000 founder shares. In connection with the September Special Meeting, on September 1, 2023, we filed the September Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nResults of Operations\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the initial public offering, described below, and identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments held in the trust account. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we had net income of $16,567,938, which consists of a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $12,633,799 and interest earned on cash and investments held in the Trust Account of $6,872,860, offset by general and administrative expenses of $1,536,647 and provision for income taxes of $1,402,074.\nFor the period January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, we had a net income of $12,965,855 which consists of a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $15,508,485 and interest earned on investments held in the trust account of $173,593, offset by transaction costs allocated to warrants of $1,180,711, general, and administrative expenses of $1,534,739, and a provision for income taxes of $773.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOn March 2, 2021, we completed the initial public offering of 50,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $500,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the sale of 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.50 per private placement warrant in a private placement to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $10,700,000.\nFollowing the initial public offering, the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of $500,000,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred $15,688,848 in transaction costs, including $8,700,000 of cash underwriting fees, $18,800,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $619,847 of other offering costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $534,549. Net income of $16,567,938 was affected by interest earned on cash and investments held in the Trust Account of $6,872,860, and a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $12,633,799. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $2,404,172 of cash for operating activities.\nFor the period January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, cash used in operating activities was $1,846,016. Net income of $12,965,855 was affected by transaction costs allocated to warrants of $1,180,711, interest earned on investments held in the trust account of $173,593, and a change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $15,508,485. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used $310,504 of cash for operating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had investments held in the trust account of $506,713,948 (including approximately $6,713,948 of interest income) consisting of U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. Through December 31, 2022, we have withdrawn $332,505 interest earned from the Trust Account.\nWe intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $3,773 cash held outside of the trust account. We intend to use the funds held outside the trust account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.\nIn order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the trust account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the trust account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a business combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.\nWe will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers. Our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet our working capital needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash of $3,773 held outside the Trust Account and available for working capital purposes. We have $1,500,000 available to draw upon under the Working Capital Loans (as defined below) and may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating its business. However, if the estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence, and negotiating a Business Combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate the business prior to a Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing or further draw on the Working Capital Loans either to complete a Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of the Public Shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination. We have until March 2, 2024, to consummate a Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate a Business Combination by this time. If a Business Combination is not consummated by this date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Management has determined that the liquidity concerns and mandatory liquidation, should a Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after March 2, 2024.\nOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFounder Shares\nOn January 11, 2021, our Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain of our offering costs in exchange for 8,625,000 founder shares, or approximately $0.003 per share. On February 18, 2021, we effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,493,750 founder shares. On February 25, 2021, we effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Companys Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 founder shares. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 founder shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 founder shares.\nThe Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founder shares until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of a business combination and (B) subsequent to a business combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a business combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nRelated Party Loans\nOn January 11, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021, or the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding amount of $173,972 outstanding under the Promissory Note was repaid on March 5, 2021. Borrowings under the Promissory Note are no longer available.\nOn March 5, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Sponsor Convertible Note) to the Sponsor (as amended on September 1, 2023), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $1,500,000 from the Sponsor for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the business combination. All unpaid principal under the Sponsor Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) March 2, 2024 and (ii) the consummation of a business combination (such earlier date, the Maturity Date). The Sponsor will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the Sponsor Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $425,360 and $300,000 in borrowings outstanding under the Sponsor Convertible Note.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Officer Convertible Note) to the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $300,000 from the Sponsor for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the business combination. All unpaid principal under the Officer Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) March 2, 2023, and (ii) the consummation of a business combination (such earlier date, the Maturity Date). The Chief Executive Officer will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the Officer Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $200,000 in borrowings outstanding under the Officer Convertible Note. The total of $625,360 and $500,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in borrowings is outstanding under both the Sponsor Convertible Note and Officer Convertible Note.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (BOKA Convertible Note) to BOKA Founder LP (BOKA), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $500,000 from BOKA for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the business combination, All unpaid principal under the BOKA Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) the termination date of the Company as listed in its organizational documents March 2, 2024 (as amended), or such later date as may be approved by the Companys stockholders in accordance with the organizational documents, and (ii) the effective date of a business combination. BOKA will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the BOKA Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to the same adjustments applicable to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the Companys initial public offering; provided, that BOKAs optional conversion shall be reduced such that the amount of principal converted pursuant to (i) the Sponsor Convertible Note, (ii) the Convertible Note, and (iii) the BOKA Convertible Note does not exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nOn September 1, 2023, in connection with the extension of the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination, we amended and restated each of the Sponsor Convertible Note, the Officer Convertible Note and the BOKA Convertible Note to extend the maturity dates thereunder to the earlier of March 2, 2024 and the effective date of a business combination.\nInvestments Held in the Trust Account\nOur portfolio of investments held in the trust account is comprised of U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or investments in money market funds that invest in U.S. government securities, or a combination thereof. The investments held in the trust account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in net gain from investments held in Trust Account on the statement of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nAdministrative Services Agreement\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial, and administrative services. We began incurring these fees on February 25, 2021, and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the business combination and our liquidation. We also paid $15,000 per month to our former chief financial officer, Jeffrey Gary, which terminated on December 31, 2021.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $18,800,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will be forfeited by the underwriters solely in the event that the Company fails to complete a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nRegistration and Stockholder Rights\nThe holders of the founder shares, private placement warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (and any Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans) were entitled to registration rights pursuant to the registration rights agreement signed upon the effective date of the initial public offering. The holders of these securities were entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants (together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in Accounting Standards Codification 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts on an Entitys Own Equity (ASC 815-40) and determined that the Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder. As such, each Warrant must be recorded as a liability and is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in the Companys statements of operations.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was measured by reference from the trading price of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants were initially valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation. The Private Placement Warrants was initial valued using Black Scholes Option Pricing Model. The subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units were valued using the instruments publicly listed trading price. During the period ending December 31, 2022, the Private Placement Warrants were deemed to be nearly identical to the Public Warrants and as such were valued using the Public Warrants publicly listed trading price.\nClass A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nWe account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of our balance sheet. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security.\nNet Income Per Common Share\nWe have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. This presentation assumes a business combination as the most likely outcome. Net income (loss) per common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We adopted ASU 2020-06 as of January 11, 2021, and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data.\nReference is made to pages through comprising a portion of this Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes In And Disagreements With Accountants On Accounting And Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls And Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of December 31, 2022 due to the Companys inability to timely file the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, which resulted in a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022.\nIn light of the material weakness described above, we plan to enhance our processes to be able to timely file our periodic reports in the future. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting due to an exemption established by the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nItem 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions That Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nPart III Item 10.

Mr. Buettell received a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Northwestern University in 1984 and a Master of Business Administration from Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management in 1988.\nNumber and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors\nWe have five directors. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of stockholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with the NYSE corporate governance requirements, we not required to hold an annual meeting until one year after its first fiscal year end following its listing on the NYSE. The term of office of the first class of directors, consisting of Mr. Buettell, will expire at our first annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the second class of directors, consisting of Mr. Ross and Ms. Driscoll, will expire at the second annual meeting of stockholders. The term of office of the third class of directors, consisting of Messrs. James and Thoresen, will expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders.\nOur officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint officers as it deems appropriate pursuant to our bylaws.\nDeparture of Directors or Principal Officers; Appointment of Principal Officers\nOn January 11, 2022, Mr. Gary notified the Company of his intention to resign from the Companys board of directors and as the Companys chief financial officer, effective January 11, 2022. Mr. Gary did not advise the Company of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to its operations, policies, or practices.\nOn January 12, 2022, the Board of the Company appointed Erik Thoresen as chief financial officer and as a director of the Company, effective January 12, 2022. Mr. Thoresen will serve as a Class III director of the Company with a term expiring at the Companys third annual meeting of stockholders following the Companys initial public offering.\nDirector Independence\nThe rules of the NYSE require that a majority of our board of directors be independent within one year of our initial public offering. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll, and Mr. Buettell are independent directors as defined in the NYSE rules and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Subject to phase-in rules, the rules of NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors, and the rules of the NYSE require that the compensation committee and the nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors.\nAudit Committee\nWe have established an audit committee of the board of directors. Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll and Mr. Buettell serve as members of our audit committee, and Mr. Ross chairs the audit committee. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent. Each of Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll and Mr. Buettell meet the independent director standard under NYSE listing standards and under Rule 10-A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act.\nEach member of the audit committee is financially literate, and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Ross qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in applicable SEC rules and has accounting or related financial management expertise.\nWe have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including:\n\u25cf assisting board oversight of (1) the integrity of our financial statements, (2) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) our independent registered public accounting firms qualifications and independence, and (4) the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us;\n\u25cf pre-approving all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; reviewing and discussing with the independent registered public accounting firm all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence;\n\u25cf setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; obtaining and reviewing a report, at least annually, from the independent registered public accounting firm describing (1) the independent registered public accounting firm internal quality-control procedures and (2) any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality-control review, or peer review, of the audit firm, or by any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities, within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with such issues;\n\u25cf meeting to review and discuss our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, including reviewing our specific disclosures under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; and\n\u25cf reviewing with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompensation Committee\nWe have established a compensation committee of the board of directors. Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll, and Mr. Buettell serve as members of our compensation committee. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have at least two members of the compensation committee, all of whom must be independent. Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll and Mr. Buettell are independent, and Mr. Buettell chairs the compensation committee.\nWe have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:\n\u25cf reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our chief executive officers compensation, evaluating our chief executive officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our chief executive officer based on such evaluation;\n\u25cf reviewing and making recommendations to our board of directors with respect to the compensation, and any incentive compensation and equity based plans that are subject to board approval of all of our other officers;\n\u25cf reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;\n\u25cf implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\n\u25cf assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\n\u25cf approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our officers and employees;\n\u25cf producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\n\u25cf reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, other than the payment to an affiliate of the Sponsor of $10,000 per month, until we consummate our initial business combination, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and reimbursement of expenses and the payment of $15,000 per month to our former chief financial officer, Mr. Gary, which terminated on December 31, 2021, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate the consummation of an initial business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements to be entered into in connection with such initial business combination.\nThe charter also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the NYSE and the SEC.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nWe have established a nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors. The members of our nominating and corporate governance are Mr. Ross, Ms. Driscoll and Mr. Buettell, and Ms. Driscoll serves as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee.\nWe have adopted a nominating and corporate governance committee charter, which details the principal functions of the nominating and corporate governance committee, including:\n\u25cf identifying, screening and reviewing individuals qualified to serve as directors, consistent with criteria approved by the board, and recommending to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u25cf developing and recommending to the board of directors and overseeing implementation of our corporate governance guidelines;\n\u25cf coordinating and overseeing the annual self-evaluation of the board of directors, its committees, individual directors and management in the governance of the company; and\n\u25cf reviewing on a regular basis our overall corporate governance and recommending improvements as and when necessary.\nThe charter also provides that the nominating and corporate governance committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of, and terminate, any search firm to be used to identify director candidates, and will be directly responsible for approving the search firms fees and other retention terms.\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders. Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board of directors.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of our officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more officers serving on our board of directors.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct Ethics that applies to all of our directors, executive officers and employees that complies with the rules and regulations of the NYSE. The Code of Business Conduct Ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. We have previously filed copies of our form of Code of Business Conduct Ethics, our form of Audit Committee Charter, our form of Compensation Committee Charter and our form of Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter as exhibits to our registration statement in connection with our initial public offering. You may review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SECs web site at www.sec.gov. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request to us in writing at 667 Madison Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10065 or by telephone at (212) 763-0619.\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us or our stockholders for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived an improper personal benefit from their actions as directors.\nWe will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also will permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We will purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement, or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors.\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nWe believe that these provisions, the directors and officers liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and ten percent stockholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers and directors were complied with. Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nOther than the payment of $15,000 per month to our former chief financial officer, Mr. Gary, which terminated on December 31, 2021, none of our directors have received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, we will pay our Sponsor $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team. In addition, our Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.\nOur audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made from funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finders and consulting fees, will be paid by the company to our Sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination.\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.\nWe do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our managements motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. Item 12. Security Ownership Of Certain Beneficial Owners And Management And Related Stockholder Matters.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 31, 2023 by:\n\u25cf each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u25cf each of our executive officers and directors; and\n\u25cf all our executive officers and directors as a group.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.

Item 15. Exhibit and Financial Statement Schedules\nReport of WithumSmith+Brown, PC, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 100)\nFinancial Statements:\nBalance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021\nStatement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021\nNotes to Financial Statements to\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nFusion Acquisition Corp. II\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Fusion Acquisition Corp. II (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 of the financial statements, if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs and complete a business combination by March 2, 2024 then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ WithumSmith+Brown, PC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nNew York, New York\nNovember 1, 2023\nPCAOB ID Number 100\nFUSION ACQUISITION CORP.

DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nFusion Acquisition Corp. II (the Company) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on January 11, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination).\nThe Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination, however, the Company intends to concentrate its efforts identifying businesses in the financial services industry, with particular emphasis on businesses in the wealth, financial advice, investment, and asset management sectors or those that are providing or changing technology for traditional financial services. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2022, relates to the Companys formation, initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.\nThe registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on February 25, 2021. On March 2, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 50,000,000 units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriter of their over-allotment option in the amount of 6,500,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $500,000,000 which is described in Note 3.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 7,133,333 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) at a price of $1.50 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Fusion Sponsor II LLC (the Sponsor), generating gross proceeds of $10,700,000, which is described in Note 4.\nTransaction costs amounted to $28,119,847, consisting of $8,700,000 in cash underwriting fees, $18,800,000 of deferred underwriting fees and $619,847 of other offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on March 2, 2021, an amount of $500,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account), located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.\nThe Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions) at the time of the Companys signing a definitive agreement in connection with its initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the public stockholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Companys warrants.\nOn November 10, 2022, the NYSE notified the Company that the NYSE determined to commence proceedings to delist the Public Warrants from the NYSE and that trading in the Public Warrants would be suspended immediately due to abnormally low trading price levels pursuant to Section 802.01D of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Trading in the Companys Class A common stock and units will continue on the NYSE.\nThe Company will only proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, as further described in the Form 10-Q for the period from January 11, 2021 to September 30, 2021. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5), and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all.\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to its Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Companys initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.\nOn February 28, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the February Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, the stockholders approved an amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the February Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which the Company has to complete an initial business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023 (later extended to March 2, 2024, as noted below) and permit the board of directors in its sole discretion to wind up operations on an earlier date as determined by them and included in a public announcement and (ii) provide holders of the shares of Class B common stock with the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the closing of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder. In connection with the February Special Meeting, stockholders holding 45,524,677 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of January 25, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $463.4 million (approximately $10.18 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $45.6 million remained in the Trust Account.\nBetween August 25, 2023 and August 31, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the Non-Redemption Agreements) with unaffiliated third party investors (the NRA Investors), pursuant to which the NRA Investors have agreed, in connection with the September Special Meeting (as defined below), to not redeem, or to reverse and revoke any prior redemption election, with respect to 2,105,697 shares of Class A common stock held by them and the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the NRA Investors an aggregate of 471,424 founder shares.\nOn August 29, 2023, in accordance with the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Sponsor elected to convert 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock held by it into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAlso on August 29, 2023, the Company and Sponsor entered into a subscription agreement (the Polar Subscription Agreement) with Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund (Polar), an unaffiliated third party of the Company, pursuant to which Polar agrees to make certain capital contributions (the Polar Capital Contribution) from time to time, at the request of the Sponsor, subject to the terms and conditions of the Polar Subscription Agreement, to the Sponsor to meet the Sponsors commitment to fund working capital needs. In exchange for the commitment of Polar to provide the Polar Capital Contribution, (i) the Company will issue shares of Class A common stock to Polar at the closing of the initial business combination; and (ii) upon repayment of working capital loans by the Company, the Sponsor will return the Investor Capital Contribution at the closing of an initial business combination. In exchange for the forgoing commitment of Polar to make capital contributions to the Sponsor, the Company agrees to, or cause the surviving entity following the closing of the initial business combination to, issue one share of Class A common stock for each dollar of the Investor Capital Contribution funded by Polar at the time of the closing of the initial business combination. The Company granted certain registration rights, as described in the Polar Subscription Agreement, with respect to such shares.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, the stockholders approved an amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the September Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which the Company has to complete an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A Common Stock such that it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. In connection with the September Special Meeting, stockholders holding 2,280,576 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of August 14, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $24.2 million (approximately $10.60 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $23.3 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 14,694,747 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which includes 2,194,747 public shares and 12,500,000 founder shares. In connection with the September Special Meeting, on September 1, 2023, the Company filed the September Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.\nThe Company will have until March 2, 2024 to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Companys warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) $10.00 per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Companys independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had cash of $3,773 held outside the Trust Account and available for working capital purposes. The Company has $1,500,000 available to draw upon under the Working Capital Loans (as defined below) and may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating its business. However, if the estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence, and negotiating a Business Combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, the Company may have insufficient funds available to operate its business prior to a Business Combination. Moreover, the Company may need to obtain additional financing or further draw on the Working Capital Loans either to complete a Business Combination or because it becomes obligated to redeem a significant number of the Public Shares upon consummation of a Business Combination, in which case the Company may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, the Company would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of the Business Combination.\nThe Company intends to complete a Business Combination by March 2, 2024. However, in the absence of a completed Business Combination, the Company may require additional capital. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, suspending the pursuit of a Business Combination. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nIn connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that if the Company is unable to raise additional funds to alleviate liquidity needs as well as complete a Business Combination by March 2, 2024, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate March 2, 2024.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statement with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. One of the more significant accounting estimates included in these financial statements is the determination of the fair value of the warrant liability. Such estimates may be subject to change as more current information becomes available and, accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash and Investments Held in Trust Account\nThe Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held-to-maturity in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Held to maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held to maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheets and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.\nClass A Common Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Shares of Class A common stock subject to mandatory redemption are classified as a liability instrument and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders equity. The Companys Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, 50,000,000 shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Class A common stock reflected in the balance sheets is reconciled in the following table:\nGross proceeds $ 500,000,000\nLess:\nProceeds allocated to Public Warrants (20,810,000 )\nClass A common stock issuance costs (26,939,136 )\nPlus:\nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value 47,749,136\nClass A common stock subject to possible redemption, as of December 31, 2021 500,000,000\nPlus:\nAccretion of carrying value to redemption value 5,253,365\nClass A common stock subject to possible redemption, as of December 31, 2022 $ 505,253,365\nOffering Costs\nOffering costs consisted of legal, accounting and other expenses incurred through the Initial Public Offering that were directly related to the Initial Public Offering. Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Offering costs allocated to warrant liabilities were expensed as incurred in the statements of operations. Offering costs associated with the Class A common stock issued were initially charged to temporary equity and then accreted to common stock subject to redemption upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering.\nThe Company classifies deferred underwriting commissions as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC 480 and FASB ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants (together with the Public Warrants, the Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815-40, and determined that the Warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder. As such, each Warrant must be recorded as a liability and is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized in the Companys statements of operations.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was measured by reference to the trading price of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants were initially valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation. The Private Placement Warrants were initially valued using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units were valued using the instruments publicly listed trading price. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Private Placement Warrants were deemed to be nearly identical to the Public Warrants such valued using the Public Warrants publicly listed trading prices.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company has been subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 was $1,402,074 and $773, respectively.\nNet Income per Common Share\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net income per share of\u202fcommon stock is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company has two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A common shares and Class B common shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. This presentation assumes a business combination as the most likely common outcome. Accretion associated with the redeemable shares of Class A common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nThe Company has not considered the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase 23,800,000 shares of common stock in the calculation of diluted income per share, since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive.\nThe following tables reflects the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share of\u202fcommon stock (in dollars, except per share amounts):\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, For the Period from\nJanuary 11, 2021\n(inception) through\nDecember 31,\nClass A Class B Class A Class B\nBasic net income per share of common stock\nNumerator:\nAllocation of net income, as adjusted $ 13,254,350 $ 3,313,588 $ 10,411,573 $ 2,554,282\nDenominator:\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 50,000,000 12,500,000 50,000,000 12,266,549\nBasic net income per share of common stock $ 0.27 $ 0.27 $ 0.21 $ 0.21\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, For the Period from\nJanuary 11, 2021\n(inception) through\nDecember 31,\nClass A Class B Class A Class B\nDiluted net income per share of common stock\nNumerator:\nAllocation of net income, as adjusted $ 13,254,350 $ 3,313,588 $ 10,372,684 $ 2,593,171\nDenominator:\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 50,000,000 12,500,000 50,000,000 12,500,000\nDiluted net income per share of common stock $ 0.27 $ 0.27 $ 0.21 $ 0.21\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature, except for the derivative warrant liabilities (see Note 11).\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\n\u25cf Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;\n\u25cf Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\n\u25cf Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nNOTE 3. PUBLIC OFFERING\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 50,000,000 Units, which includes a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 6,500,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant (Public Warrant). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 9).\nNOTE 4. PRIVATE PLACEMENT\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant, or $10,700,000 in the aggregate in a private placement. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 9). A portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Warrants was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law), and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFounder Shares\nIn January 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration of 8,625,000 shares of the Companys Class B common stock (the Founder Shares). On February 18, 2021, the Company effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of its Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 10,493,750 Founder Shares outstanding. On February 25, 2021, the Company effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Companys Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 Founder Shares. As a result of the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 Founder Shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 Founder Shares. All share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated and that there are no more share subject to forfeiture.\nThe Sponsor has agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier of (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the Companys stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Class A common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nAdministrative Services Agreement\nThe Company entered into an agreement, commencing February 25, 2021, through the earlier of the Companys consummation of a Business Combination or its liquidation, to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial, and administrative services. Additionally, the Company paid $15,000 per month to its former chief financial officer, Jeffrey Gary, which terminated on December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $120,000 in fees for these services. For the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $100,000 of administrative service fees. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a total of $220,000 and $100,000, respectively, of administrative support services was included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets.\nPromissory Notes - Related Party\nOn January 11, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note), pursuant to which the Company could borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2021 or the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The outstanding amount of $173,972 outstanding under the Promissory Note was repaid on March 5, 2021. Borrowings under the Promissory Note are no longer available.\nRelated Party Loans\nIn addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants.\nOn March 5, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Sponsor Convertible Note) to the Sponsor (as further amended on September 1, 2023), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $1,500,000 from the Sponsor for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the Business Combination. All unpaid principal under the Sponsor Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) March 2, 2024 and (ii) the consummation of a Business Combination (such earlier date, the Maturity Date). The Sponsor will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the Sponsor Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were amounts of $425,360 and $300,000, respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the Sponsor Convertible Note.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Officer Convertible Note) to the Chief Executive Officer (as further amended on September 1, 2023), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $300,000 from the Sponsor for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the Business Combination. All unpaid principal under the Officer Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) March 2, 2024, and (ii) the consummation of a Business Combination (such earlier date, the Maturity Date). The Chief Executive Officer will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the Officer Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $200,000 in borrowings outstanding under the Officer Convertible Note. A total of $625,360 and $500,000 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in borrowings is outstanding under both the Sponsor Convertible Note and Officer Convertible Note.\nOn November 1, 2022, the Company issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (BOKA Convertible Note) to BOKA Founder LP (BOKA) (as further amended on September 1, 2023), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $500,000 from BOKA for ongoing expenses reasonably related to the business of the Company and the consummation of the business combination. All unpaid principal under the BOKA Convertible Note will be due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) the termination date of the Company as listed in its organizational documents, currently Marach 2, 2024, or such later date as may be approved by the Companys stockholders in accordance with the organizational documents, and (ii) the effective date of a business combination. BOKA will have the option, at any time on or prior to the Maturity Date, to convert any amounts outstanding under the BOKA Convertible Note into warrants to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock, at a conversion price of $1.50 per warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to the same adjustments applicable to the private placement warrants sold concurrently with the Companys initial public offering; provided, that BOKAs optional conversion shall be reduced such that the amount of principal converted pursuant to (i) the Sponsor Convertible Note, (ii) the Officer Convertible Note, and (iii) the BOKA Convertible Note does not exceed $1,500,000 in the aggregate.\nNOTE 6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIn February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy is not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements.\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new 1% U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by covered corporations (which include publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations) beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the Excise Tax). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. Because the Company is a Delaware corporation and its securities are trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), the Company is a covered corporation for this purpose. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax; however, no guidance has been issued to date. It is uncertain whether, and/or to what extent, the Excise Tax could apply to any redemptions of the public shares repurchase by the Company of its common stock or in the event of liquidation, in each instance after December 31, 2022, including any redemptions in connection with an initial business combination or in the event the Company does not consummate an initial business combination by March 2, 2024.\nWhether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the Excise Tax on a redemption of shares of Class A common stock or other stock issued by the Company would depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the Excise Tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemption treated as a repurchase of stock in connection with the initial business combination, an extension or otherwise, (iii) the structure of the initial business combination, (iv) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with the initial business combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the initial business combination but issued within the same taxable year of a redemption treated as a repurchase of stock) and (v) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. As noted above, the Excise Tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder. The imposition of the Excise Tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete an initial business combination or for effecting redemptions and may affect the ability to complete an initial business combination. In addition, the Excise Tax could cause a reduction in the per share amount payable to public stockholders in the event the Company liquidates the trust account due to a failure to complete an initial business combination within the requisite time frame.\nRegistration Rights\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on February 25, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants, and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to shares of Class A common stock). The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders will have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $18,800,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will be forfeited by the underwriters solely in the event that the Company fails to complete a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nNOTE 7. CLASS A COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE REDEMPTION\nClass A Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 280,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 50,000,000 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption, which are presented as temporary equity.\nHolders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders except as required by law.\nThe shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination, the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of shares of Class A common stock by public stockholders), including the total number of shares of Class A common stock issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of a Business Combination, excluding any shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into shares of Class A common stock issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.\nNOTE 8. STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nPreferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designation, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nClass B Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 12,500,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.\nNOTE 9. WARRANT LIABILITIES\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, there are 16,666,667 Public Warrants and 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering and (b) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination.\nThe Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares of Class A common stock upon exercise of a warrant unless the share of Class A common stock issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants.\nThe Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its best efforts to qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.\nRedemption of warrants for cash. Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the warrants for redemption:\n\u25cf in whole and not in part;\n\u25cf at a price of $0.01 per warrant;\n\u25cf upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder; and\n\u25cf if, and only if, the closing price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial business combination as described in the warrant agreement) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before the Company sends to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.\nIf and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, it may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.\nRedemption of warrants for Class A common stock. Commencing ninety days after the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants:\n\u25cf in whole and not in part;\n\u25cf at $0.10 per warrant upon a minimum of 30 days prior written notice of redemption provided that holders will be able to exercise their warrants prior to redemption and receive that number of shares, based on the redemption date and the fair market value of the Class A common stock;\n\u25cf if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 per share (as adjusted per stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, reclassifications, recapitalizations and the like) on the trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders;\n\u25cf if, and only if, the Private Placement Warrants are also concurrently exchanged at the same price (equal to a number of shares of Class A common stock) as the outstanding Public Warrants, as described above; and\n\u25cf if, and only if, there is an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating thereto available throughout the 30-day period after written notice of redemption is given\nIf the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption for cash, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Companys assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of Class A common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of Class A common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Companys board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (the Newly Issued Price), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Class A common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates a Business Combination (such price, the Market Value) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.\nThe Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions, and will be entitled to certain registration rights (see Note 6). Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holders option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees (except for a number of shares of Class A common stock as described above under Redemption of warrants for Class A common stock). If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.\nNOTE 10. INCOME TAX\nThe Company did not have any significant deferred tax assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Companys net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nDeferred tax assets\nNet operating loss carryforward $ -\n$ (773 )\nOrganizational costs/ start-up expenses 563,041 286,614\nTotal deferred tax asset 563,041 285,841\nValuation allowance (563,041 ) (285,841 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of allowance $ -\n$ -\nThe income tax provision consists of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nFederal\nCurrent $ 1,402,074 $ 773\nDeferred (277,200 ) (285,841 )\nState\nCurrent -\n-\nDeferred -\n-\nChange in valuation allowance 277,200 285,841\nIncome tax provision $ 1,402,074 $ 773\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $0 and $3,681, respectively, of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income, indefinitely.\nIn assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, and for the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, the change in the valuation allowance was $277,200 and $285,841, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the Companys effective tax rate at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\nStatutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal tax benefit 0.0 % 0.0 %\nChange in fair value of warrants (14.7 )% (25.1 )%\nTransaction costs allocated to warrants 0.0 % 1.9 %\nChange in valuation allowance 1.5 % 2.2 %\nIncome tax provision 7.8 % 0.0 %\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction in various state and local jurisdictions and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities.\nNOTE 11.\u2009FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held-to-maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities. Held to maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held to maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheets and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.\nAt December 31, 2022, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $1,447 in cash and $506,712,501 in U.S. Treasury securities. Through December 31, 2022, the Company withdrew $332,505 of interest income from the Trust Account to pay franchise taxes.\nAt December 31, 2021, assets held in the Trust Account were comprised of $439 in cash and $500,173,154 in U.S. Treasury securities. Through December 31, 2021, the Company did not withdraw any interest income from the Trust Account.\nThe following table presents information about the Companys assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value. The gross holding gain and fair value of held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nHeld-To-Maturity Securities\nLevel\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nHolding\nGain\nFair Value\nDecember 31, 2022\nU.S. Treasury Securities (Matures on 03/02/23)\n$ 506,712,501\n$ 134,018\n$ 506,846,519\nDecember 31, 2021\nU.S. Treasury Securities (Matures on 06/02/22)\n$ 500,173,154\n$ (72,651 )\n$ 500,100,503\nThe following table presents information about the Companys liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:\nDescription Level December 31,\nDecember 31,\nLiabilities:\nWarrant Liability - Public Warrants $ -\n$ 10,000,000\nWarrant Liability - Public Warrants $ 1,156,194 $ -\nWarrant Liability - Private Placement Warrants $ 494,851 $ -\nWarrant Liability - Private Placement Warrants $ -\n$ 4,284,844\nThe warrants are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liabilities on the balance sheets. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within change in fair value of warrant liabilities in the statements of operations.\nThe subsequent measurements of the Public Warrants after the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units is classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker FSNB.WS. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the observable market had no value, and as such, this is now deemed Level 3 due to the use of comparable and a Black-Scholes model for the warrant value. For periods subsequent to the detachment of the Public Warrants from the Units, the close price of the Public Warrant price was used as the fair value of the Public Warrants as of each relevant date, until the warrants were no longer trading and the value was not available. As such, the Company obtained a valuation in which the specialists use comparable companies for a Black-Scholes model.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Private Placement Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. Although the Private Placement Warrants are not redeemable by the Company (the Public Warrants may be redeemed when the common stock price exceeds $18.00 per share), the contractual terms are nearly identical to the Public Warrants.\nThe following tables present the changes in the fair value of level 3 warrant liabilities:\nPrivate\nPlacement Public Warrant\nLiabilities\nFair value as of January 11, 2021 (inception) $ -\n$ -\n$ -\nInitial measurement on March 2, 2021 8,983,329 20,810,000 29,793,329\nChange in fair value (4,698,485 ) (4,478,333 ) (9,176,818 )\nTransfer to Level 1 -\n(16,331,667 ) (16,331,667 )\nFair value as of December 31, 2021 $ 4,284,844 $ -\n$ 4,284,844\nPrivate\nPlacement Public Warrant\nLiabilities\nFair value as of December 31, 2021 $ 4,284,844 $ -\n$ 4,284,844\nChange in fair value (3,789,993 ) -\n(3,789,993 )\nTransfer to Level 3 -\n1,156,194 1,156,194\nFair value as of December 31, 2022 $ 494,851 $ 1,156,194 $ 1,651,045\nTransfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 are recognized at the end of the reporting period in which a change in valuation technique or methodology occurs. The estimated fair value of the Public Warrants that transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 fair value measurement during the period from January 11, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021 was $16,331,667.\nNOTE 12.\u2009SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than as described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\nOn February 28, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the February Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, the stockholders approved an amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the February Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which the Company has to complete an initial business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023 and permit the board of directors in its sole discretion to wind up operations on an earlier date as determined by them and included in a public announcement and (ii) provide holders of the shares of Class B common stock with the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the closing of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder. In connection with the February Special Meeting, stockholders holding 45,524,677 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of January 25, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $463.4 million (approximately $10.18 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $45.6 million remained in the Trust Account.\nBetween August 25, 2023 and August 31, 2023, the Company and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the Non-Redemption Agreements) with unaffiliated third party investors (the NRA Investors), pursuant to which the NRA Investors have agreed, in connection with the September Special Meeting (as defined below), to not redeem, or to reverse and revoke any prior redemption election, with respect to 2,105,697 shares of Class A common stock held by them and the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the NRA Investors an aggregate of 471,424 founder shares.\nOn August 29, 2023, in accordance with the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Sponsor elected to convert 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock held by it into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nAlso on August 29, 2023, the Company and Sponsor entered into a subscription agreement (the Polar Subscription Agreement) with Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund (Polar), an unaffiliated third party of the Company, pursuant to which Polar agrees to make certain capital contributions (the Polar Capital Contribution) from time to time, at the request of the Sponsor, subject to the terms and conditions of the Polar Subscription Agreement, to the Sponsor to meet the Sponsors commitment to fund working capital needs. In exchange for the commitment of Polar to provide the Polar Capital Contribution, (i) the Company will issue shares of Class A common stock to Polar at the closing of the initial business combination; and (ii) upon repayment of working capital loans by the Company, the Sponsor will return the Investor Capital Contribution at the closing of an initial business combination. In exchange for the forgoing commitment of Polar to make capital contributions to the Sponsor, the Company agrees to, or cause the surviving entity following the closing of the initial business combination to, issue one share of Class A common stock for each dollar of the Investor Capital Contribution funded by Polar at the time of the closing of the initial business combination. The Company granted certain registration rights, as described in the Polar Subscription Agreement, with respect to such shares.\nOn September 1, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, the stockholders approved an amendment to the second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the September Charter Amendment) to (i) extend the time in which the Company has to complete an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A Common Stock such that it would cause the Companys net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. In connection with the September Special Meeting, stockholders holding 2,280,576 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Companys trust account as of August 14, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $24.2 million (approximately $10.60 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $23.3 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 14,694,747 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which includes 2,194,747 public shares and 12,500,000 founder shares.\nOn October 18, 2023, the NYSE notified the Company, and publicly announced, that the staff of NYSE Regulation determined to suspend trading immediately and commence proceedings to delist each of (i) the Companys units, each consisting of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant, listed to trade on the NYSE under the symbol FSNB.U (the Units) and (ii) the Class A Common Stock (together with the Units, the Company Securities), listed to trade on the NYSE under the symbol FSNB. The notification states that NYSE Regulation reached its determination pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSEs Listed Company Manual because the Company had fallen below the NYSEs continued listing standard requiring a listed acquisition company to maintain an average aggregate global market capitalization attributable to its publicly-held shares over a consecutive thirty-trading day period of at least $40 million. The notification further states that the Company has a right to a review of NYSE Regulations determination by a Committee of the Board of Directors of the NYSE, and that the NYSE will apply to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the Company Securities upon completion of all application procedures, including any appeal by the Company of NYSE Regulations determination. The Company will consider all of its options, including its option to pursue a review, in responding to the notification. The Company anticipates that the Company Securities may be traded over-the-counter following the suspension in trading of the Company Securities on the NYSE.\nExhibit
