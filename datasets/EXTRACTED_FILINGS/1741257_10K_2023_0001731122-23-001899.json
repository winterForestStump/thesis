    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd. (the Company, we, us, our and similar terminology) was incorporated under the name Kelinda in the state of Nevada on December 18, 2017 to create health related applications. The Companys first project was to develop a mobile application (the App) for free test panels to identify general health conditions and targeted diseases for both children and adults. The main purpose of the App was to remind users of doctors appointments and examinations. The App synchronized with Google and Apple calendars and sent notifications regarding pills-taking time, required tests or doctor appointments via the App and email. We expected to generate revenue from in-app subscriptions. Prior to the Change of Control as defined below, we had developed terms of reference, design of our application, creation of an Apple store account and were at the server and application development stage.\nPursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement), entered into as of March 16, 2020, by and between Fuming Yang (the Purchaser) and Petru Afanasenco, Andrei Afanasenco and Yuriy Turchynskyy, as the representative of certain stockholders (collectively, the Sellers) of the Company, the Sellers sold an aggregate of 7,948,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company to the Purchaser in consideration for an aggregate purchase price of $330,000 in cash from the Purchasers personal funds (the Transaction). Following consummation of the Transaction, the Purchaser holds approximately 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The Transaction resulted in a change in control (Change in Control) of the Company from the Sellers to the Purchaser. In connection with the Transaction, Petru Afanasenco, the President and director of the Company, and Andrei Afanasenco, the Secretary and Treasurer of the Company, both resigned from all of their director and officer positions with the Company, effective immediately upon the consummation of the Transaction.\nOn June 3, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a change in the name of the Company from Kelinda to Bangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd., effective upon filing. In connection with its name change, the Companys ticker symbol on the OTC Pink Market was changed from KLDA to BFGX.\nFollowing this Change in Control, the Company changed its business plan to engage in online business services in the Peoples Republic of China. The Company plans to engage in developments of personal daily life assistance mobile applications, online educational trainings, and employment recruitment services in China. The Company plans to first roll out the plan with a focus on the tier-3 and tier-4 cities in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi in China. The Company is presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish and implement these business plans. The Company aims to start implementing these business plans in the near term.\nFrom the Change of Control to the date of this Report, the Company has not commenced its planned business and presently has no business operations, revenues or assets and thus is and has been a shell company as defined by Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the Securities Act). The Company does not have an established timetable to implement our business plan, and until it does, the Company will remain a shell company. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nNot applicable. ITEM 1B.

We cannot assure you that there will be an active market in the future for our common stock.\n(b) Stockholders of Record\nBased upon information furnished by our transfer agent, as of October 12, 2023, the Company had approximately three stockholders of record. Because some of our common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial stockholders.\n(c) Dividends\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n(d) Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nWe currently do not have any equity compensation plans.\n(e) Performance Graph\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.\n(f) Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with our audited financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this Report. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (the U.S. GAAP).\nOverview\nThe Company was incorporated under the name Kelinda in the state of Nevada on December 18, 2017 to create health related applications.\nFollowing the Change in Control, the Company changed its business plan to engage in online business service in the Peoples Republic of China.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nFor the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not generate any revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $49,800 and $48,000, respectively. The operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2023 primarily included general and administrative expense of $8,550 and professional fees of $41,250, whereas for the same period of 2022, the operating expenses primarily included general and administrative expense of $7,250 and professional fees of $40,750. The increase in 2023 was mainly due to the increase in general and administrative expenses as there were higher filing fees.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing, our net loss was $49,800 and $48,000, respectively, for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nGoing Concern\nThe future of the Company is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing to implement our new business plans and initiatives and our ability to generate positive net profits from implementation of our business plans. Management has plans to seek additional capital funding through either equity financings or debt financings from its principal stockholders to support its operations for the next twelve months. However, there is no assurance that such funds will be available or available on acceptable terms. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no assets.\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had liabilities of $2,250 and $1,350, respectively and accumulated deficit of $296,921 and $247,121, respectively.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $48,700, which is the result of: (1) net loss for the year of $49,800; and (2) adjustment for increase in accounts payable of $1,100.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $50,057, which is the result of: (1) net loss for the year of $48,000; and (2) adjustment for decrease in accounts payable of $2,057.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $48,700, all of which were stockholders capital contributions to support the Companys operations.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash provided by financing activities was $50,057, all of which were stockholders capital contributions to support the Companys operations.\nMaterial commitments\nWe had no material commitments as of June 30, 2023.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of June 30, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements. In preparing our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. See Note 3 of our financial statements included in the Report.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENTS INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPage\nConsolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB 6117)\nBalance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nStatements of Cash Flows for Years Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Bangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd. (the Company) as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nConsideration of the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses and has minimal operations which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Pinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nPinnacle Accountancy Group of Utah\n(a dba of Heaton & Company, PLLC)\nFarmington, Utah\nOctober 13, 2023\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash $ - $ -\nTotal Current Assets - -\nTOTAL ASSETS $ - $ -\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nLiabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts Payable $ 2,450 $ 1,350\nTotal Current Liabilities 2,450 1,350\nTotal Liabilities 2,450 1,350\nStockholders Deficit\nCommon Stock: $0.001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized, 7,950,500 shares issued and outstanding 7,950 7,950\nAdditional Paid-in Capital 286,521 237,821\nAccumulated Deficit (296,921 ) (247,121 )\nTotal Stockholders Deficit (2,450 ) (1,350 )\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT $ - $ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended June 30, 2023 Year Ended June 30, 2022\nREVENUE: $ - $ -\nEXPENSES:\nGeneral and administrative expenses 49,800 48,000\nTotal operating expenses $ 49,800 $ 48,000\nLoss before income taxes $ (49,800 ) $ (48,000 )\nIncome tax expense - -\nNET LOSS $ (49,800 ) $ (48,000 )\nNet loss per common share basic & diluted $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 )\nWeighted average of common shares outstanding basic & diluted 7,950,500 7,950,500\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nYears Ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nCommon Stock Additional\nPaid-in\nCapital Accumulated Deficit Total\nStockholders\nDeficit\nShares Amount\nBalance as of June 30, 2021 7,950,500 $ 7,950 $ 187,764 $ (199,121 ) $ (3,407 )\nNet loss - - - (48,000 ) (48,000 )\nContributions from stockholders - - 50,057 - 50,057\nBalance as of June 30, 2022 7,950,500 $ 7,950 $ 237,821 $ (247,121 ) $ (1,350 )\nNet loss - - - (49,800 ) (49,800 )\nContributions from stockholders - - 48,700 - 48,700\nBalance as of June 30, 2023 7,950,500 $ 7,950 $ 286,521 $ (296,921 ) $ (2,450 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nYear Ended\nJune 30, 2022\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet Loss\n$ (49,800 )\n$ (48,000 )\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n(1,100 )\n(2,057 )\nNet cash used by Operating Activities\n(48,700 )\n(50,057 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nCapital contributions\n48,700\n50,057\nNet cash provided by Financing Activities\n48,700\n50,057\nNet cash increase (decrease) for period\n-\n-\nCash at beginning of period\n-\n-\nCash at end of period\n-\n-\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nInterest paid\n$ -\n$ -\nIncome taxes paid\n$ -\n$ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements.\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS\nBangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd. (the Company) was incorporated under the name Kelinda in the state of Nevada on December 18, 2017 to create health related applications. The Companys first project was to develop a mobile application (the App) for free test panels to identify general health conditions and targeted diseases for both children and adults. The main purpose of the App was to remind users for doctors appointments and examinations. The App synchronized with Google and Apple calendars and sent notifications regarding pills-taking time, required tests or doctor appointments via the App and email. The Company expected to generate revenue from in-app subscriptions. Prior to the Change of Control as defined below, the Company had developed terms of reference, design of the App, creation of an Apple store account and was at the server and application development stage.\nPursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Agreement), entered into as of March 16, 2020, by and between Fuming Yang (the Purchaser) and Petru Afanasenco, Andrei Afanasenco and Yuriy Turchynskyy, as the representative of certain stockholders (collectively, the Sellers) of the Company, the Sellers sold an aggregate of 7,948,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company to the Purchaser in consideration for an aggregate purchase price of $330,000 in cash from the Purchasers personal funds (the Transaction). Following consummation of the Transaction, the Purchaser holds approximately 99% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The Transaction resulted in a change in control (Change in Control) of the Company from the Sellers to the Purchaser.\nOn June 3, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Companys Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a change in the name of the Company from Kelinda to Bangfu Technology Group Co., Ltd., effective upon filing. In connection with its name change, the Companys ticker symbol on the OTC Pink Market changed from KLDA to BFGX.\nFollowing this Change in Control, the Company changed its business plan to engage in online business services in the Peoples Republic of China. The Company plans to engage in developments of personal daily life assistance mobile applications, online educational trainings, and employment recruitment services in China. The Company plans to roll out the plan with a focus in the tier-3 and tier-4 cities in the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi first. The Company is presently evaluating the optimal corporate and legal structures in China necessary to establish and implement these business plans. The Company aims to start implementing these business plans in the near future but its ability to execute on its business plans and initiatives will depend upon the developments of the pandemic, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions imposed by the respective various governments and oversight bodies in China.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (the U.S. GAAP), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. As a start-up, the Company has had no revenues and has accumulated losses through June 30, 2023. The Company currently has limited working capital and has not established a source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital from its principal stockholder to fund operating expenses. The Company may also raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. However, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The functional and reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\nTaxation\nCurrent income taxes are provided on the basis of net profit for financial reporting purposes, adjusted for income and expense items which are not assessable or deductible for income tax purposes, in accordance with the regulations of the relevant tax jurisdictions.\nDeferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements, net operating loss carry forwards and credits. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided in accordance with the laws of the relevant taxing authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income in which temporary differences are expected to be reversed or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the enactment of the change.\nThe Company considers positive and negative evidence when determining whether a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry-forward periods, its experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and its tax planning strategies. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income within the carry-forward periods provided for in the tax law and during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. When assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, the Company has considered possible sources of taxable income including (i) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,\n(ii) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry-forwards, (iii) future taxable income arising from implementing tax planning strategies, and (iv) specific known trend of profits expected to be reflected within the industry.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in its judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company initially and subsequently measures the tax benefit as the largest amount that the Company judges to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The Companys liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. The Companys effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management. The Company classifies interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nThere were no current and future income tax provision recorded for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 since the Company did not generate any revenues in these fiscal years.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBasic Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260 Earnings per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive. There were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company.\nNOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nThe Company has 75,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share. There were 7,950,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2023.\nThere were no issuances of common stock during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023, the Companys current major stockholder, Fuming Yang, contributed a total of $48,700 in cash to support the Companys working capital needs.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, the Companys current major stockholder, Fuming Yang, contributed a total of $50,057 in cash to support the Companys working capital needs.\nNOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOther than the capital contributions as disclosed in Note 4 above, there were no other related party transactions during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company does not have any commitments or contingencies as of June 30, 2023 or 2022.\nNOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for federal income tax consists of the following:\nSchedule of federal income tax\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nUS$ US$\nIncome tax rate 21 % 21 %\nIncome tax benefit 10,458 10,080\nChange in valuation allowance (10,458 ) (10,080 )\nNet provision for income taxes - -\nThe cumulative tax effect at the expected rate of 21% of significant items comprising our net deferred tax amount is as follows:\nSchedule of deferred income tax assets\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nUS$ US$\nDeferred income tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryover 62,353 51,895\nLess: valuation allowance (62,353 ) (51,895 )\nNet deferred income tax assets - -\nThe related deferred tax benefit on the above unutilized tax losses has a full valuation allowance not recognized against it as there is no certainty of its realization. Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those disclosed.\nNOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn accordance with ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to June 30, 2023, through the date when these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our Certifying Officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the Certifying Officer), the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023 due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company has identified the following material weaknesses, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff, as of June 30, 2023: (i) lack of proper segregation of duties and risk assessment process; (ii) lack of formal documentation in internal controls over financial reporting; and (iii) lack of independent directors and an audit committee.\nBecause of these material weaknesses, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on the criteria established in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nPART III ITEM 10.
