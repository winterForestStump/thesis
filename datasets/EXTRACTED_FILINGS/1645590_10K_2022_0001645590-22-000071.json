    "content": "ITEM 1. Business\nWe are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.\nWe use the terms \"Hewlett Packard Enterprise\", \"HPE\", \"the Company\", \"we\", \"us\", and \"our\" to refer to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nWhile great progress has been made in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic (\"COVID-19\" or \"pandemic\"), there remain global challenges from the pandemic's lasting effects. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, due to an unprecedented demand for electronic devices and related industry-wide supply constraints, the global economy encountered a challenging supply chain environment. At the end of fiscal 2022, the supply chain challenges we experienced as a result of the pandemic eased, but we are currently unable to predict the extent to which they may adversely impact our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to COVID-19, see risks identified in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe are unable to predict the extent to which the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nFor the past two years, the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. The pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to or at a later time result in, a global slowdown of economic activity, including travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities in some cases, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. Our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, including the various restrictions imposed by cities, counties, states and countries on our employees, customers, partners and suppliers designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been assessed and mitigated, the ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic, including as a result of possible subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 or of new variants thereof and measures taken in response thereto, will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted.\nBased on employee vaccination rates and public health guidance, we have begun a return to most HPE offices on a hybrid basis for most employees, adhering to any government requirements in effect locally. We continue to monitor the situation, including cases within our workforce, and will take action to adjust office attendance policies as circumstances warrant in order to protect the health and safety of employees, contractors, and others who visit our sites. Vaccination requirements or other risk mitigation strategies for site entry and other activities remain in effect in many countries where it is legally permissible to implement such a requirement(s), though discretion to implement such policies has been returned to local executive leadership.\nThe pandemic and its uneven recovery have adversely affected, continue to adversely affect, and we expect may continue to adversely affect, our business, in a variety of ways, including by restricting our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and disrupting the supply chains of hardware products. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of our customers, partners, and suppliers, there have been, and there may continue to be, delays of hardware product shipments from our vendors and out of our manufacturing and logistics operations worldwide as a result of capacity issues. While capacity shortages are beginning to show signs of recovery, they may nevertheless persist, adversely disrupting our business. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets, which has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our stock price, our ability to access capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs.\nOutbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises may in the future adversely affect, among other things, demand for our products and services; our operations and sales, marketing, and distribution efforts; the supply chains of hardware products and components; our research and development capabilities; our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes; and other important business activities. Outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises may also result in our restriction or suspension of international and/or domestic travel, prohibitions of non-essential activities in some cases, and limit our in-person activities within HPE and with customers. Such outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises may also present operational challenges, such as unanticipated disruptions in services provided through our localized physical infrastructure, which can in turn curtail the functioning of critical components of our IT systems, and adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders, provide services, respond to customer requests and maintain our worldwide business operations.\nThe negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises on the broader global economy and related impacts on our or our customers business operations and demand for our products and services will depend on future developments and actions taken in response to such events, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additional impacts and risks that we are not currently aware of may arise. We are similarly unable to predict the full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises on our customers, partners, and suppliers. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nTable of Content\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and medical epidemics or pandemics. The impacts and frequency of any of the above could furthermore be exacerbated by climate change, particularly in countries where we operate that have limited infrastructure and disaster recovery resources. We are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events. Although it is impossible to completely predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative. The occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain, result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nClimate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations. Our corporate headquarters is located in Spring, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire risk, electric utilities have been periodically deploying public safety power shutoffs, which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. In 2017, our principal worldwide IT data centers in Houston were flooded due to Hurricane Harvey. Since then, HPE has increased its resiliency through site selection and infrastructure technological investments to mitigate and adapt to physical risks from climate change. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change through such efforts, we may be unsuccessful in doing so as there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Furthermore, climate change may reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for these negative impacts of natural disasters by contributing to an increase in the incidence and severity of such natural disasters.\nThe manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Puerto Rico, Czech Republic, Mexico, China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE's distribution channels and customers. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, IT system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory, or political issues. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed.\nOur transition to a software consumption-based business model may adversely affect our business, operating results and free cash flow.\nWe are currently transitioning to an as-a-service company, providing our entire portfolio through a range of software consumption-based, pay-per-use and as-a-service offerings. We will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and license-based model, ultimately giving our customers choices in consuming HPE products and services in a traditional or as-a-service offering. Such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties, and we may be unable to complete the transition to a software consumption-based business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner, and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the software consumption transition, even if we successfully complete the transition. The transition to a software consumption-based business model also means that our historical results, especially those achieved before we began the transition, may not be indicative of our future results. Further, as customer demand for our software consumption-based business model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our as-a-service offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement).\nIn addition, the transition to an as-a-service company is expected to require incremental capital requirements, resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term, and may require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs. Furthermore, we anticipate needing to continually adapt our go-to-market structure, to better align with the software consumption-based business model. We must adapt our sales processes for new sales and marketing approaches, including those required by our shift to software consumption-based services and other changes resulting from the pandemic. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees.\nTable of Content\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments. Further, our software consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational, technical, legal or other costs.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly.\nOur operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain solutions, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, and contractual, relational and labor risks, each of which is described below.\nComponent shortages. We have been and are currently experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints due to economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. As shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components has increased, and we may be exposed to quality issues and delivery delays. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.\nExcess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements, non-cancelable commitments, or other inventory management arrangements with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nContractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. Any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nContingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.\nSingle-source suppliers. We obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale or customization needs. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity, and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nTable of Content\nWhile our restructuring plans are substantially complete, their implementation periods are ongoing, and it is possible that we may not achieve all of the expected benefits of such restructuring plans.\nWe have announced and have been implementing, restructuring plans, including the HPE Next initiative (whereby we are simplifying our operating model and streamlining our offerings, business processes and business systems) and the cost optimization and prioritization plan, in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, as well as simplify our organizational structure, upgrade our IT infrastructure and redesign business processes. While our restructuring plans are substantially complete, their implementation periods are ongoing, and it is possible that we may not be able to maintain all the cost savings and benefits that were attained in connection with our restructurings. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to sustain all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information about our restructuring plans, the HPE Next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan, see Note 3, \"Transformation Programs\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nAny failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, \"business combination and investment transactions\"), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, in September 2020, we acquired Silver Peak Systems, Inc., an SD-WAN industry leader and in September 2019, we acquired Cray\u202fInc., a global supercomputer leader. In April 2017 and September 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software businesses, respectively. See also the risk factors below under the heading \"Risks Related to Prior Separations.\"\nRisks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial results, including our effective tax rate:\nWe may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to retain employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers; (2) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (3) significant increase in costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\nOur ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company's product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters.\nIn order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which could affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nFor an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business.\nBusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nFor a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated.\nThe impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental\nTable of Content\napprovals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nManagement's attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives.\nSystem security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nAs a leading technology firm, we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors and activist hackers (collectively, \"malicious parties\") who have been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, so far, these attacks have not resulted in material losses to HPE, nor have any of HPE's consumers, customers, or employees informed HPE that these attacks resulted in material harm to them. It is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties. Malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, including within our cloud-based environments and offerings. Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain and the systems or networks of other third parties on whom we rely, and as such, may embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may create a heightened risk of such cyberattacks or exacerbate system vulnerabilities, especially in light of our hybrid work environment. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs, and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store and transmit customer data, including commercially sensitive and personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and other privacy laws. With our business increasingly providing as-a-service offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure. Incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information, sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory fines, litigation, and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure also have experienced, and may experience, interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Furthermore, our data centers depend on predictable and reliable energy and networking capabilities, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected or disrupted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to the effects of climate change. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our stock price.\nTable of Content\nIf we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services, and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software and services as we deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data, everywhere. HPE delivers unique, open and intelligent technology solutions, including those utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms. To successfully execute this strategy, we must address business model shifts and optimize go-to-market execution by improving cost structure, aligning sales coverage with strategic goals, improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and wireless networking. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe process of developing and improving an edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service solution and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services, and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. For example, as the transition to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as-a-service progresses, we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloud-based solutions for our customers. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products, services, and solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights or our products not perform as promised, our business results may be adversely affected. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel.\nHaving developed an edge-to-cloud platform product in HPE GreenLake, we must be able to continue to scale quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's life cycle or at all. Our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform faces competition from peer companies with their own cloud platform offerings, and to succeed, we will need to compete effectively across numerous factors. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution, including new features of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, could result in our offerings being late to reach the market, which could further harm our competitive position.\nIf we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services, and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design, and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services, and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or \"patch\") to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows, and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.\nIssues in the development and use of artificial intelligence may result in reputational harm or liability.\nWe currently incorporate AI capabilities into certain of our offerings, and our research into and continued development of such capabilities remain ongoing. As with many innovations, AI presents risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain\nTable of Content\nbiased information. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by us or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues, and while we aim to use AI ethically and attempt to predict and anticipate ethical issues presented by its use, we may be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both direct and indirect (distributors and resellers) sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nOur financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation, and market trends. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.\nOur inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop, and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing, and IT support positions. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.\nOur failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As competition for highly skilled employees in our industry has grown increasingly intense, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, higher than anticipated levels of employee attrition. These risks to attracting and retaining the necessary talent may be exacerbated by recent labor constraints and inflationary pressures on employee wages and benefits.\nTable of Content\nFailure to meet ESG expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price.\nThere has been an increased focus from regulators and stakeholders on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks; diversity, equity, and inclusion; responsible sourcing and supply chain; human rights and social responsibility; and corporate governance and oversight. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues, provide updates on them, and accomplish our goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be outside of our control or could have a material adverse impact on our business, including on our reputation and stock price. Further, there is uncertainty around the accounting standards and climate-related disclosures associated with emerging laws and reporting requirements and the related costs to comply with the emerging regulations.\nOur failure or perceived failure to achieve our ESG goals, maintain ESG practices, or comply with emerging ESG regulations that meet evolving regulatory or stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that our stakeholders have about our action or inaction on ESG-related issues. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products and services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and could also reduce our stock price.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.\nWe encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, product range and ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, and security of our offerings. If our products, services, support, and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.\nWe have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical, and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.\nCompanies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face aggressive price competition and may continue to do so. As a consequence of inflation and higher supply chain and manufacturing costs, we have been increasing the prices of many of our products and services to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.\nBecause our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product\nTable of Content\ndecisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.\nEven if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products.\nInternational Risks\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.\nOur business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware, software and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products, services, and solutions, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows, and expenses.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. For example, in response to increasing inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with central banks around the world, have been raising interest rates and signaled expectations of additional rate increases. It is difficult to predict the impact of such events on us, our third-party partners or customers or economic markets more broadly, which have been and will continue to be highly dependent upon the actions of governments and businesses in response to macroeconomic events, and the effectiveness of those actions. Such actions may impact our ability, desire, or the timing of seeking funding for various investment opportunities. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, ongoing U.S. federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products, services, and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services, and solutions.\nOur business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade. Current U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold. U.S. government trade policy has resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. Similarly, changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely. In addition, changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions.\nSales outside the United States constituted approximately 67% of our net revenue in fiscal 2022. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\nongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the relationship between China and the U.S.;\ninflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services;\nadverse or uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including fears of a global economic downturn or recession;\nTable of Content\nnetwork security, privacy, and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies;\nlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers;\nlocal labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs, or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;\nmanaging our geographically dispersed workforce;\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\nlocal content and manufacturing requirements, which could impact our ability to sell into those markets;\ndifficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws; and\nfluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted business and financial performance in that region. HPE is proceeding with an exit of our remaining business in Russia and Belarus, while closely monitoring and analyzing the trade restrictions imposed against Russia and Belarus by the United States, the European Union (the EU), and several other jurisdictions to ensure HPEs compliance with applicable laws. We cannot provide any assurance that such exit will be efficient or uninterrupted, which may negatively impact our operational expenses due to increased relocation costs or impact service delivery in such geographies.\nWe implement policies, procedures, and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. But in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by anti-corruption laws. Our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies, and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the Japanese yen and British pound can have an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.\nFrom time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license, or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers, and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide, or otherwise use in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed, or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.\nTable of Content\nOur products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nMuch of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software components may become obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in the IT industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.\nThird parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing, or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs, and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper, or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position, and access to capital markets.\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends.\nIn addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments;\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nreducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\nTable of Content\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock.\nRecent quantitative tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks around the world, may affect our short-term ability or desire to incur debt. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nThe revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.\nOur revenue, gross margin, and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups, and geographic markets and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer, and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the trade sanctions imposed by the U.S., the EU, and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations and financial performance in both countries. There could be additional negative impacts to our net revenues, earnings, and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally, due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe.\nFurthermore, the relationship between China and the U.S., and any subsequent action that may be taken by either country, may negatively impact our operations and financial performance. There could be additional uncertainty surrounding the enforceability of contract obligations, as well as the timing and form of payments from China.\nCompetition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions, and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts, and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.\nOur uneven sales cycle and supply chain disruptions make planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\nIn some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations, and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nSeparately, supply chain shortages and constraints have, in some instances, resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. We have, in some instances, responded to such constraints by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity. While these measures have been taken to shorten lead times to deliver products to customers, they may\nTable of Content\nalso result in excess or obsolete components in the future if the demand for our products is less than we anticipate, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" In addition, as discussed in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Use of Estimates\" and Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations such as those concerning environmental protection. For example, we face increasing complexity related to product design; the use of regulated, hazardous, and scarce materials; the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products; the transportation and shipping of products; climate change regulations; and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Any changes to current environmental legal requirements, such as the EU's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, the EU's Lot 9 regulation on product energy efficiency, and India's regulation on e-waste collection and recycling, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China, India and/or other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted, and implemented throughout the world (including, but not limited to, the European Commissions proposal on Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence). If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, it could result in loss of market access or limit offerings in those markets or our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering and cooling owned IT infrastructures.\nIn addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings. The increase in as-a-service offerings may also be impacted by data localization and international data transfer requirements under various privacy laws, including those arising from the Schrems II ruling in Europe. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions. Our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions third-party claims and reputational damage.\nFailure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur contracts with federal, state, provincial, and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to contract formation, administration, and performance, as well as manufacturing content and security requirements. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts. If we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.\nTable of Content\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding, and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 34 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, would impose a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, could increase tax complexity and uncertainty, and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act) into law, which includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the \"Corporate AMT\"), beginning in fiscal 2024, of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period and an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We are evaluating the Corporate AMT and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate, as well as any other impacts the Inflation Reduction Act may have on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Prior Separations\nThe stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC Technology Company or Micro Focus International plc (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us.\nThe completed separations and mergers of our former Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology Company (\"DXC\") (the \"Everett Transaction\" or \"Everett\") and our Software Segment with Micro Focus International plc (\"Micro Focus\") (the \"Seattle Transaction\" or \"Seattle\") were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"); and (ii) the relevant merger as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While the Seattle Transaction generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software separation.\nEach opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo\nTable of Content\nshares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nWe obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment. Those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The conclusions of the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material. If the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nUnder the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.\nWe continue to face a number of risks related to our separation from HP Inc., our former parent, including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in the future adversely impact our reputation.\nIn connection with our separation from HP Inc. on November 1, 2015 (the \"Separation\"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities under the Separation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely affect the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nGeneral Risks\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.\nInvestors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage, or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures, or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; developments in our transformation programs or in our transition to an as-a-service business model; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our competitors; inflation; market volatility or downturns caused by outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, or other macroeconomic dynamics; developments relating to pending investigations, claims, and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's performance also may affect the price of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock. Volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\nTable of Content ITEM 1B.

The pandemic-related lockdowns in China we experienced in the first half of the fiscal period alleviated somewhat in the second half of the fiscal period. The challenging supply chain environment moderated our full-year revenue growth, elevated costs, and delayed certain unit shipments, resulting in part in a higher level of backlog and related inventory at the end of the current period as compared to the end of the prior-year period.\nTo address the challenging supply chain environment, we are taking proactive measures such as guiding certain customer demand to specific products, enhancing component engineering design, and multi-sourcing with indirect procurement. We expect the supply chain environment to continue to present challenges in the near term.\nAdditionally, we are experiencing a challenging foreign exchange environment, which has moderated our revenue and earnings growth. We expect the unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary trend to continue in the longer term. We expect the substantial completion of our HPE Next and cost optimization and prioritization restructuring plans coupled with related cost reduction measures, and operational efficiencies, to moderate the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange effects and inflationary pressures in fiscal 2023.\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union (\"EU\"), and other countries in response have negatively impacted our operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, we suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 2022, we determined that it is no longer tenable to maintain operations in Russia and Belarus and have been proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of our remaining business in these countries.\nIn fiscal 2021, our operations in Russia and Belarus accounted for approximately 2% of our total net revenue. During fiscal 2022, we recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million primarily related to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance, and abandoned assets, $99 million of which was included in Financing cost, $12 million in Cost of services, and $50 million in Disaster charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nWe will continue monitoring the social, political, regulatory, and economic environment in Russia and Ukraine, and will consider further actions as appropriate. More broadly, there could be additional adverse impacts to our net revenues, earnings, and cash flows should the situation continue or escalate geopolitical tensions and the impacts of recession, inflation, and supply chain pressures, both regionally and globally.\nRecent U.S. Tax Legislation\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the Corporate AMT) of 15% on the adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) of corporations with average AFSI exceeding $1.0 billion over a three-year period. The Corporate AMT is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2024. We are evaluating the Corporate AMT and its potential impact on our future U.S. tax expense, cash taxes, and effective tax rate. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods.\nOther Trends and Uncertainties\nWe are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the market shift of workloads to cloud-related information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure business models, emergence of software-defined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality, and growth in IT consumption models. Certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Therefore, the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging, and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAnother set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions, our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors.\nA third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. We provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or software consumption-based, pay-per-use and as-a-service offerings across our entire portfolio of HPE products and services.\nAdditionally, the global pandemic has accelerated several trends relevant to the Company. First, the exponential increase of data at the edge driven by the proliferation of devices. Second, the need for a cloud experience everywhere to manage the growth of data at the edge. Third, data growth is creating new opportunities with the need to quickly extract value from the captured data. Enterprises have embraced multi-cloud strategies, as they recognize the need for different cloud environments for different types of data and workloads. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform, while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense, by paying only for the IT they use.\nIn response to the aforementioned challenges, we are accelerating our development and innovation efforts in the areas of our strategic focus, including the Intelligent Edge and HPC & AI businesses, while at the same time, strengthening our core Compute and Storage businesses, by investing in key areas of growth and accelerating our as-a-service pivot to become the edge-to-cloud company for our customers and partners with our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nDuring the fiscal period, we announced significant advancements to our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, our flagship hybrid offering that enables organizations to modernize all their applications and data, from edge to cloud and supports multi-cloud experiences everywhere - including clouds that live on-premises, at the edge, in a colocation facility, and in a public cloud. The platform advancements included a unified operating experience with one view of all services edge to cloud along with convergence with the Aruba Central cloud service, twelve new cloud services including network as-a-service, data services, high performance computing functions, compute operations management, and availability of the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform in the online marketplaces of several leading distributors. We also launched HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Enterprise, which is a private cloud experience for traditional and cloud-native workloads. These updates strengthen the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and help customers drive their data modernization needs.\nThe following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and, Cash Requirements and Commitments sections present information as of October 31, 2022, unless otherwise noted.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet revenue of $28.5 billion represented an increase of 2.6% (increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis) as robust demand reflected by a high order backlog was moderated by a combination of unfavorable currency fluctuations, ongoing supply chain constraints, and lower revenue from Russia. The net revenue increase was led by effective pricing management in server products and strong demand for networking products. The gross profit margin of 33.4% (or $9.5 billion) represents a decrease of 0.3 percentage points and was primarily driven by a combination of supply chain constraints and related cost increases, higher costs in HPC & AI, and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Moderating the gross profit decrease was pricing discipline and strong cost management in server products. The operating profit margin of 2.7%, represents a decrease of 1.4 percentage points primarily due to goodwill impairment charges for the HPC & AI and Software businesses. The decrease in operating profit margin was primarily moderated by lower transformation costs. We generated $4.6 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.8 billion of free cash flows primarily due to improved working capital management.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated GAAP financial results:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 Change\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNet revenue $ 28,496 $ 27,784 2.6%\nGross profit $ 9,506 $ 9,376 1.4%\nGross profit margin 33.4 % 33.7 % (0.3)pts\nEarnings from operations $ 782 $ 1,132 (30.9)%\nOperating profit margin 2.7 % 4.1 % (1.4)pts\nNet earnings $ 868 $ 3,427 (74.7)%\nDiluted net earnings per share $ 0.66 $ 2.58 $(1.92)\nCash flow from operations $ 4,593 $ 5,871 (21.8)%\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated non-GAAP financial results:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 Change\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNet revenue adjusted for currency $ 29,213 $ 27,784 5.1%\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 9,667 $ 9,424 2.6%\nNon-GAAP gross profit margin 33.9 % 33.9 % -pts\nNon-GAAP earnings from operations $ 3,026 $ 2,848 6.3%\nNon-GAAP operating profit margin 10.6 % 10.3 % 0.3pts\nNon-GAAP net earnings $ 2,664 $ 2,602 2.4%\nNon-GAAP diluted net earnings per share $ 2.02 $ 1.96 $0.06\nFree cash flow $ 1,794 $ 1,551 $243\nEach non-GAAP financial measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure herein. Please refer to the section \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" included in this MD&A for these reconciliations, usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, and material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nAnnualized Revenue Run-rate (\"ARR\")\nOur pivot to as-a-service continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and includes a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds.\nARR represents the annualized revenue of all net HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from finance leases), and software-as-a-service, software consumption revenue, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue and is not intended to be combined with it.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2022 and 2021:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nARR $ 936 $ 796\nYear-over-year growth rate 17 % 36 %\nThe 17% year over year increase in ARR represents growth from our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and related financial services. The growth in the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform was due to an expanding customer installed base moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations, supply chain constraints and related installation delays. At the segment level, the growth is led by Storage as-a-service including Zerto and Intelligent Edge as-a-service activity.\nReturning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework, which also consists of strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments, and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of October 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $4.76 billion, compared to $4.33 billion as of October 31, 2021, representing an increase of $0.43 billion.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), which requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nWe believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners, and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs.\nSignificant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nTo recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. We establish SSP for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. When the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data, such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. We establish SSP ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nTaxes on Earnings\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nOur effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax, or cash management reasons.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 90 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our (Provision) benefit for taxes, Net earnings (loss) and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, \"Taxes on Earnings\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on the first day of the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nAs of October 31, 2022, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, \"Segment Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains three reporting units, Software, CMS and A & PS.\nWhen performing the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived mostly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived mostly from the market approach. Under the income approach, the fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted cash flow analysis of management's short-term and long-term forecast of operating performance. This analysis includes significant assumptions\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nregarding revenue growth rates, expected operating margins, and timing of expected future cash flows based on market conditions and customer acceptances. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using the income approach. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nOur fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for goodwill related to the HPC & AI and Software reporting units. There was no impairment of goodwill for our other reporting units.\nThe decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows as compared to our fiscal 2021 long-term plan due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges as well as an increase in cost of capital. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the HPC & AI reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe HPC & AI reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of $2.9 billion as of October 31, 2022 and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges reflected in the results for the year ended October 31, 2022. The challenges are primarily related to supply chain constraints and other operational challenges impacting our ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. We currently believe these challenges will be successfully addressed when supply chain constraints ease. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or operating margins decline, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if we have significant or sustained decline in our stock price, it is possible our estimates about the HPC & AI reporting unit's ability to successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges.\nThe decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the Software reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe Software reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of $123 million as of October 31, 2022 and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0% as of the annual test date. As noted above, the Software reporting unit relies significantly on the market approach, which is impacted by market volatility. If global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen and cause a further decline in equity market or if revenue expectations are not met, this could result in the carrying value of the Software reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges.\nThe excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units, excluding HPC & AI and Software, ranged from approximately 22% to 142% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our other reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease, all of the other reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case.\nBased on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, are\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nnot a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) the prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nDollars % of Revenue Dollars % of Revenue Dollars % of Revenue\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 28,496 100.0 % $ 27,784 100.0 % $ 26,982 100.0 %\nCost of sales 18,990 66.6 % 18,408 66.3 % 18,513 68.6 %\nGross profit 9,506 33.4 % 9,376 33.7 % 8,469 31.4 %\nResearch and development 2,045 7.2 % 1,979 7.1 % 1,874 6.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative 4,941 17.3 % 4,929 17.7 % 4,624 17.2 %\nAmortization of intangible assets 293 1.0 % 354 1.3 % 379 1.4 %\nImpairment of goodwill 905 3.2 % - - % 865 3.2 %\nTransformation costs 473 1.7 % 930 3.3 % 950 3.5 %\nDisaster charges 48 0.2 % 16 0.1 % 26 0.1 %\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges 19 0.1 % 36 0.1 % 80 0.3 %\nEarnings (loss) from operations 782 2.7 % 1,132 4.1 % (329) (1.2) %\nInterest and other, net (188) (0.7) % (211) (0.8) % (215) (0.8) %\nTax indemnification and related adjustments (67) (0.2) % 65 0.2 % (101) (0.4) %\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit 134 0.5 % 70 0.3 % 136 0.5 %\nLitigation judgment - - % 2,351 8.5 % - - %\nEarnings from equity interests 215 0.8 % 180 0.6 % 67 0.3 %\nEarnings (loss) before taxes 876 3.1 % 3,587 12.9 % (442) (1.6) %\n(Provision) benefit for taxes (8) (0.1) % (160) (0.6) % 120 0.4 %\nNet earnings (loss) $ 868 3.0 % $ 3,427 12.3 % $ (322) (1.2) %\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nNet revenue\nIn fiscal 2022, total net revenue of $28.5 billion, increased by $0.7 billion, or 2.6% (increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue increased by $0.6 billion or 6.5% to $9.4 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. increased by $0.1 billion or 0.7% to $19.1 billion.\nFrom a segment perspective, net revenue increased across many of our segments due to the improved demand environment led by revenue growth of 11%, 4%, and 0.3% in Intelligent Edge, Compute, and HPC & AI, respectively, and decreased 7%, 2%, 1% in Corporate Investments and Other, Financial Services, and Storage, respectively.\nThe components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021\nPercentage Points\nCompute 1.6 -\nHPC & AI 0.1 0.3\nStorage (0.1) 0.3\nIntelligent Edge 1.3 1.6\nFinancial Services (0.2) 0.2\nCorporate Investments and Other (0.4) 0.2\nTotal segment 2.3 2.6\nElimination of intersegment net revenue 0.3 0.4\nTotal HPE 2.6 3.0\nGross Profit\nFor the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, the total gross profit margin of 33.4%, represents a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily driven by a combination of supply chain constraints and related cost increases, higher costs in HPC & AI, and unfavorable currency fluctuations, with costs from expected credit losses related to exiting our Russia and Belarus businesses adding to the overall decline. Moderating the gross profit decrease was pricing discipline and strong cost management in server products.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expense increased by $66 million, or 3% due primarily to higher overall employee compensation expense, which contributed 1.8 percentage points to the change, and a combination of higher facilities expense, training and travel expenses, and software expenditures, which in total contributed 1.3 percentage points to the change.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\")\nSG&A expense increased by $12 million, or 0.2% due primarily to higher travel expense as the economy reopens and COVID-19 restrictions ease, higher software expenditures, and the release of bad debt reserves in the prior-year period, which contributed 1.2 percentage points, 0.5 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points to the change, respectively. The increase was partially offset by a combination of lower employee cost driven by lower variable compensation expense and cost savings from our transformation programs which in total contributed 1.9 percentage points to the change. Additionally, the overall increase in SG&A expense was moderated across various expense categories by favorable currency fluctuations.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization expense decreased by $61 million, or 17% due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods moderated by an increase in amortization expense in the current period resulting\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nfrom recent acquisitions. Additionally, the decrease in the current fiscal period was due to certain write-offs taken in the prior fiscal period.\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of goodwill for fiscal 2022 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of $905 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI and Software reporting units was below the carrying value of their net assets. Refer to Note 11, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II for more information.\nTransformation programs and costs\nOur transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan (launched in 2020) and the HPE Next initiative (launched in 2017).\nTransformation costs decreased by $457 million, or 49% due primarily to lower restructuring charges recorded in the current fiscal period as restructuring actions related to employee severance, infrastructure, and other under the cost optimization and prioritization plan are approaching completion primarily in fiscal 2023. For a further discussion, refer to Note 3, Transformation Programs\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net expense decreased by $23 million due primarily to early debt redemption costs incurred in the prior-year period, while in the current-year period a combination of higher gains from the sale of certain assets, lower interest expense from lower average borrowings, and increased interest income from higher interest rates contributed to the net expense decline. This decline was moderated by the current period containing lower gains from equity investments and unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments\nWe record changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement within Tax indemnification and related adjustments. We also record changes to certain pre-separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification.\nWe recorded Tax indemnification and related adjustments expense of $67 million and income of $65 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2022 resulted from changes in certain pre-separation tax liabilities, for which we partially shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement, and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2021 primarily included the impacts of a Brazilian Supreme Court decision received regarding the base on which two social contribution taxes in Brazil (\"PIS\" and \"COFINS\") are imposed. As a result of this decision, the Company is entitled to recover credits and associated interest related to the overpayment of these transaction taxes imposed between 2005 and 2019 to be used to offset future Brazilian tax liabilities. As such, we have recorded benefits of $17 million and $80 million, both net of taxes, for the recovery of PIS and COFINS, respectively, during fiscal 2021, of which $25 million was included in Net revenue, $10 million related to interest income was included in Interest and other, net, and $80 million related to pre-separation liabilities was included in Tax indemnification and related adjustments. The corresponding income taxes of $18 million as a result of this recovery were included in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses. The credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or special termination benefits.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit increased by $64 million due primarily to lower amortized actuarial losses, partially offset by higher interest cost due to higher discount rates and lower expected returns on assets in the current period.\nLitigation judgment\nLitigation judgment represents the $2.35 billion settlement we received in October 2021 in relation to the Itanium litigation judgment. The gain was recognized as other income and presented as a Litigation judgment in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the prior-year period. For further discussion, refer to Note 17, Litigation and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nEarnings from equity interests\nEarnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. Earnings from equity interests increased by $35 million due primarily to lower amortization expense from basis difference and higher net income earned by H3C in the current period, partially offset by gains from certain venture investments in the prior-year period.\n(Provision) benefit for taxes\nFor fiscal 2022 and 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $8 million and $160 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 0.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. Our tax rate for fiscal 2022 also included the effects of the non-deductible goodwill impairment. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2022, we recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n$150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,\n$99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,\n$43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters,\n$42 million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowance,\n$30 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc.\n$27 million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance,\n$12 million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in Global Intangible Low Taxed Income, and\n$11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit matters.\nIn fiscal 2021, we recorded $294 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n$180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,\n$157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,\n$39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes,\n$32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified by HP Inc.\nThese benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nSegment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), who is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), uses to evaluate, view and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.\nA description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to Segments can be found in Note 2, \"Segment Information\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nSegment Results\nThe following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021:\nHPE\nConsolidated Compute HPC & AI Storage Intelligent Edge Financial Services Corporate\nInvestments and Other\nDollars in millions, except for per share amounts\nNet revenue(1)\n$ 28,496 $ 12,742 $ 3,192 $ 4,711 $ 3,674 $ 3,339 $ 1,255\nYear-over-year change % 2.6 % 3.7 % 0.3 % (1.0) % 11.3 % (1.8) % (7.4) %\nEarnings (loss) from operations(2)\n$ 782 $ 1,780 $ 11 $ 682 $ 549 $ 399 $ (92)\nEarnings (loss) from operations as a % of net revenue 2.7 % 14.0 % 0.3 % 14.5 % 14.9 % 11.9 % (7.3) %\nYear-over-year change percentage points (1.4) pts 3.2 pts (7.0) pts (1.8) pts (0.5) pts 0.4 pts (0.3) pts\n(1)HPE consolidated net revenue excludes inter-segment net revenue.\n(2)Segment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nCompute\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020 % Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 12,742 $ 12,284 $ 12,274 3.7 % 0.1 %\nEarnings from operations $ 1,780 $ 1,323 $ 1,002 34.5 % 32.0 %\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue 14.0 % 10.8 % 8.2 %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nCompute net revenue increased by $458 million, or 3.7% (increased 6.0% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to higher average unit prices resulting from a combination of increased sales of server configurations with more complex component architectures in our next generation products and disciplined pricing actions. The net revenue increase was moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower unit shipments resulting from supply constraints due to the challenging supply chain environment. As a result, we ended the period with a high level of order backlog.\nCompute experienced product revenue growth in the rack and synergy server categories moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their end-of-life. Services net revenue declined primarily due to lower revenue from Russia and the impact of delayed hardware shipments on services contracts.\nCompute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.2 percentage points due to decreases in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to pricing discipline and strong cost management partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and the impact of supply chain constraints and related costs.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to cost reduction measures and lower variable compensation expense.\nHPC & AI\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020 % Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 3,192 $ 3,184 $ 3,102 0.3 % 2.6 %\nEarnings from operations $ 11 $ 231 $ 282 (95.2) % (18.1) %\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue 0.3 % 7.3 % 9.1 %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nHPC & AI net revenue increased by $8 million or 0.3% (increased 1.9% on a constant currency basis) as a result of growth in HPC led by Converged Edge Systems (formerly known as Edge Compute) and in Data Solutions. The increase was moderated by a decline in net revenue from HPE Cray products as a result of supply chain constraints and other operational challenges impacting the achievement of certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition. The increase in net revenue was also moderated by lower services revenue due primarily to an unfavorable portfolio mix of service offerings and unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nHPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 7.0 percentage points primarily due to increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher operational costs, supply chain constraints and related cost increases, and lower revenue from higher-margin services. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to higher investments in research and development which focus on high-performance computing and AI solutions, including integrating such solutions into our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.\nStorage\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020\n% Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 4,711 $ 4,760 $ 4,682 (1.0) % 1.7 %\nEarnings from operations $ 682 $ 775 $ 810 (12.0) % (4.3) %\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue 14.5 % 16.3 % 17.3 %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nStorage net revenue decreased by $49 million, or 1.0% (increased 0.5% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations and supply chain constraints. Net revenue declined in Storage products moderated by an increase in Storage services. The decline in Storage products was led by declines in HPE 3PAR, as we transition to its next generation of product platforms, such as HPE Alletra and HPE Primera products, and lower traditional storage revenue. The increase in Storage services was led by Zerto Services and higher subscription services as we continue our transition to more services-intensive, and software-rich offerings, partially offset by lower support services revenue.\nStorage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points as cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue remained unchanged and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased. Cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue remained unchanged as the impact of increased sales of higher- margin Zerto products was moderated by supply chain constraints and related costs, which unfavorably impacted the mix of certain higher-margin products, and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher investments in research and development and SG&A, focused on as-a-service offerings, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nIntelligent Edge\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020\n% Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 3,674 $ 3,302 $ 2,872 11.3 % 15.0 %\nEarnings from operations $ 549 $ 509 $ 346 7.9 % 47.1 %\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue 14.9 % 15.4 % 12.0 %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nIntelligent Edge net revenue increased by $372 million, or 11.3% (increased 14.0% on a constant currency basis) primarily due to a robust demand environment, reflected in a high backlog, which continues to be impacted by supply constraints resulting from a challenging supply chain environment. Net revenue increased in both Intelligent Edge products and services but was moderated by unfavorable currency fluctuations. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by the wireless local area network (\"WLAN\") business, partially offset by declines in the Switching business due to material constraints. Growth in services revenue was led by higher attached support services and our as-a-service offerings.\nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.5 percentage points primarily due to an increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to supply chain constraints and related costs and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased primarily due to lower variable compensation expense and an increase in the scale of net revenue.\nFinancial Services\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020\n% Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 3,339 $ 3,401 $ 3,352 (1.8) % 1.5 %\nEarnings from operations $ 399 $ 390 $ 284 2.3 % 37.3 %\nEarnings from operations as a % of net revenue 11.9 % 11.5 % 8.5 %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nFS net revenue decreased by $62 million, or 1.8% (increased 1.7% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher asset management revenue from pre-owned equipment sales, lease buyouts, and remarketing equipment sales.\nFS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.4 percentage points due primarily to lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from a combination of lower depreciation expense and bad debt. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower employee cost driven by lower variable compensation expense.\nThe provision for expected credit losses due to the Company's exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses for the year ended October 31, 2022, was excluded from segment operating results.\nFinancing Volume\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nDollars in millions\nFinancing volume $ 6,252 $ 6,168 $ 6,005\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 1.4% in fiscal 2022 as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by higher financing associated with third-party product sales and related service offerings, partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations and lower financing of HPE product sales and related service offerings.\nPortfolio Assets and Ratios\nThe FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nDollars in millions\nFinancing receivables, gross $ 8,359 $ 9,198\nNet equipment under operating leases 4,103 4,001\nCapitalized profit on intercompany equipment transactions(1)\n241 275\nIntercompany leases(1)\n97 96\nGross portfolio assets 12,800 13,570\nAllowance for doubtful accounts(2)\n222 228\nOperating lease equipment reserve 44 39\nTotal reserves 266 267\nNet portfolio assets $ 12,534 $ 13,303\nReserve coverage 2.1 % 2.0 %\nDebt-to-equity ratio(3)\n7.0x 7.0x\n(1)Intercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.\n(2)Allowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.\n(3)Debt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.5 billion and $11.9 billion at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at October 31, 2022 and 2021, was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, FS net cash and cash equivalents were $923 million and $898 million, respectively.\nNet portfolio assets as of October 31, 2022 decreased 5.8% from October 31, 2021. The decrease generally resulted from unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by new financing volume exceeding portfolio runoff during the period.\nFS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $82 million, $95 million and $93 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2022, FS experienced a decrease in billed finance receivables compared to October 31, 2021, which included a limited impact to collections from customers as a result of the pandemic, and customers from Russia. We are currently unable to fully predict the extent to which the pandemic and our exit from Russia and Belarus businesses may adversely impact future collections of our receivables.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCorporate Investments and Other\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 vs 2021\n% Change 2021 vs 2020\n% Change\nDollars in millions\nNet revenue $ 1,255 $ 1,356 $ 1,298 (7.4) % 4.5 %\nLoss from operations $ (92) $ (95) $ (206) 3.2 % 53.9 %\nLoss from operations as a % of net revenue (7.3) % (7.0) % (15.9) %\nFiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021\nCorporate Investments and Other net revenue decreased by $101 million, or 7.4% (decreased 0.4% on a constant currency basis) due to unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nCorporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.3 percentage points due primarily to lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to improved service delivery efficiencies in A & PS and lower variable compensation expense largely offset by a lower mix of higher margin license revenue in Software. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the scale of the net revenue decline partially offset by lower variable compensation expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Overview\nWe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisitions and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the funds made available and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future thereafter. We continue to monitor the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and other global economies, the capital markets, consumer behavior, our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.\nActual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2022 were the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.\nWe use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2022 and 2021. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $49 million and $35 million at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest rate risk\nWe also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our investment portfolio and financing receivables. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.\nWe often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed.\nIn order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of interest income received on certain variable-rate investments, by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2022 and 2021. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt, investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $32 million and $58 million at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 8, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of goodwill\nDescription of the matter At October 31, 2022, the Companys goodwill was $17.4 billion, of which $2.9 billion related to the High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (HPC & AI) reporting unit. As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level and more frequently when warranted based on indicators of impairment. Auditing managements goodwill impairment test for the HPC & AI reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate of the HPC & AI reporting unit was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the weighted average cost of capital, revenue growth rate, operating margin and terminal value, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\nHow we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys goodwill impairment review process, including controls over managements review of the significant assumptions described above.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the Companys HPC & AI reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and evaluated whether changes to the Companys business model, product mix and other factors would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions.\nIn addition, we tested managements reconciliation of the fair value of all of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We involved our valuation professionals to evaluate the application of valuation methodologies in the Companys annual impairment test.\nEstimation of variable consideration\nDescription of the matter As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for sales to its customers after deducting managements estimates of variable consideration which may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners and distributors. Estimated variable consideration is presented within other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and totaled $1.1 billion at October 31, 2022. Auditing the estimates of variable consideration was complex and judgmental due to the level of uncertainty involved in managements estimate of expected usage of these programs.\nHow we addressed\nthe matter in our audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys process for estimating variable consideration, including controls over managements review of the significant assumptions described above.\nTo test the Companys determination of variable consideration we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions to historical experience of the Company to develop an expectation of the variable consideration associated with product remaining in the distribution channel at October 31, 2022, which we compared to managements recorded amount. In addition, we inspected the underlying agreements and compared the incentive rates used in the Companys analyses with contractual rates. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates by comparing previous estimates of variable consideration to the amount of actual payments in subsequent periods.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 8, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated December 8, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 8, 2022\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") to large global enterprises and governmental entities.\nRussia/Ukraine Conflict\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed by the U.S., European Union (\"EU\") and other countries in response have negatively impacted the Company's operations in both countries and increased economic and political uncertainty across the world. In response to the sanctions imposed, in February 2022, the Company suspended all new sales and shipments to Russia and Belarus and implemented compliance measures to address the continuously changing regulatory landscape. Based on a further assessment of business risks and needs, in June 2022, the Company determined that it is no longer tenable to maintain its operations in Russia and Belarus and is proceeding with an orderly, managed exit of its remaining business in these countries.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million primarily related to expected credit losses of financing and trade receivables, employee severance and abandoned assets, $99 million of which was included in Financing cost, $12 million in Cost of services and $50 million in Disaster charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company continues to monitor the social, political, regulatory and economic environment in Russia and Ukraine, and will consider further actions as appropriate.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.\nThe Company consolidates a Variable Interest Entity (\"VIE\") where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity's operation. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE by considering the purpose and design of the entity and the risks the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in the VIE.\nThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records its proportionate share of income or losses in Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nNon-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as they were not material for any periods presented.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, net periodic benefit costs, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, and impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nbelieves that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $279 million for fiscal 2022 and was not material for the prior years presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and are committed to perform, each party's rights including payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable.\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services. The Company determines whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance obligations. Arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. The Company classifies its hardware, perpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where the Company delivers hardware or software, it is typically the principal and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from sales of products and services and the associated support and maintenance, and such revenue is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, in exchange for those products or services. Variable consideration offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nTransfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. The Company's hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On its product sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. Revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (\"SSP\") is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. The Company establishes SSP for most of its products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. When the SSP is not directly observable, the Company estimates SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nobjectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nJudgment is applied in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners and distributors. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, the Company estimates the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. The Company also considers the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nContract Balances\nAccounts receivable and contract assets\nA receivable is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services the Company has transferred to a customer that is unconditional. A contract asset is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services transferred to a customer that is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.\nThe Company's contract assets include unbilled receivables which are recorded when the Company recognizes revenue in advance of billings. Unbilled receivables generally relate to services contracts where a service has been performed and control has transferred, but invoicing to the customer is subject to future milestone billings or other contractual payment schedules. The Company classifies unbilled receivables as Accounts receivable.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, or the amount is due, from the customer. The Company's contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recorded when amounts invoiced to customers are in excess of revenue that can be recognized because performance obligations have not been satisfied and control of the promised products or services has not transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue largely represents amounts invoiced in advance for product (hardware/software) support contracts, consulting projects and product sales where revenue cannot be recognized yet.\nCosts to obtain a contract with a customer\nThe Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily sales commissions, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to expense the costs of obtaining a contract as incurred for contracts with terms of one year or less. The typical amortization periods used range from two to five years. The Company periodically reviews the capitalized sales commission costs for possible impairment losses. The amortization of capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 7, \"Balance Sheet Details\" for additional information.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units with only a service condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For stock options and restricted stock units with both a service condition and a performance or market condition, the expense is recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is determined at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Plans\nThe Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and post-retirement plans. The costs and obligations for these plans depend on various assumptions. Major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates,\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nmortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. These assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, \"Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\".\nThe discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nThe following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on the net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2022:\nChange in basis\npoints Change in Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nIn millions\nAssumptions:\nDiscount rate (25) $ 21\nExpected increase in compensation levels 25 $ 6\nExpected long-term return on plan assets (25) $ 39\nThe Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life expectancy of participants. In limited cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach.\nAdvertising\nCosts to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising expense totaled approximately $179 million in fiscal 2022, $188 million in fiscal 2021, and $143 million in fiscal 2020.\nRestructuring\nThe Company's transformation programs include charges to approved restructuring plans. Restructuring charges include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. These restructuring actions require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs. The Company records restructuring charges based on estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of the Company's restructuring actions, refer to the discussions in Note 3, \"Transformation Programs\".\nTaxes on Earnings\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nfeasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a determination was made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nThe Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions as well as any related interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") tax in the U.S. The Company elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company may record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers and the length of time receivables are past due. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The Company establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables.\nFinancing Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, the Company records a specific reserve. The Company maintains a general reserve using a credit loss model on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions, and forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.\nNon-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables\nThe Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is the suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.\nThe Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss. For more details on the collateral program, see Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\".\nCredit risk with respect to accounts receivable from trade customers and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's receivable from trade customers and financing receivables.\nThe Company utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture company-designed products. The Company may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 94% and 92% of the Company's manufacturer receivables of $1.0 billion and $0.9 billion at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company includes the manufacturer receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis. The Company's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part by the amount the Company owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as the Company generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the manufactured products are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company obtains certain components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of the Company's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which the Company is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect the Company's revenue and gross margins.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is primarily related to cash received under the Company's collateral securities agreements for its derivative instruments and cash restricted under the fixed-term securitization program for the issuance of asset-backed debt securities.\nInventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the value of its inventory and writes down the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts, market conditions, technological changes, product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues. The write down for excess or obsolescence is charged to the provision of inventory, which is a component of Cost of Products and Cost of Services in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 40 years for buildings and\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nimprovements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAs of November 1, 2021, the Company increased its expected useful life of new servers and storage equipment assets from four years to five years. Concurrently, the Company completed an assessment of its existing server and storage equipment assets and extended the remaining useful lives of such assets by one year. The effects of this change in estimate reduced depreciation expense and increased net income and basic and diluted earnings per share by immaterial amounts for fiscal 2022.\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.\nLeases\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company enters into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Upon lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease liability is measured at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments not yet paid over the lease term and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which the Company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The ROU asset is based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities, while non-lease components, such as maintenance or utility charges are expensed as incurred. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components that are accounted for separately and not included in its leased assets and corresponding liabilities for the majority of the Company's lease agreements. The Company allocates consideration to the lease and non-lease components using their relative standalone values.\nFor finance leases, the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is recorded separately using the interest method. For operating leases, lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company's lease offerings are non-cancelable and the payment schedule primarily consists of fixed payments. Variable payments that are based on an index are included in lease receivables. The Company allocates consideration amongst lease components and non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis, when lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations. At the end of the lease term, the Company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.\nThe Company retains a residual position in equipment through lease and finance agreements which is equivalent to an estimated market value. The residual amount is established prior to lease inception, based upon estimated equipment values at end of lease using product road map trends, historical analysis, future projections and remarketing experience. The Company's residual amounts are evaluated at least annually to assess the appropriateness of the carrying values. Any anticipated declines in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in current earnings. The Company is able to optimize the recovery of residual values by selling equipment in place, extending lease arrangements on a fixed term basis, entering into a monthly usage rental term beyond the initial lease term, and selling lease returned equipment in the secondary market. The contractual lease agreement also identifies return conditions that ensures the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return minus any normal wear and tear. During the residual review process, product changes, product updates, as well as market conditions are reviewed and adjustments if other than temporary are made to\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nresidual values in accordance with the impact of any such changes. The remarketing sales organization closely manages the sale of equipment lease returns to optimize the recovery of outstanding residual by product.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\"), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs a quantitative test for all of its reporting units as part of its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived most significantly from the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).\nIntangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives, long-lived assets and ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For lease assets such circumstances would include a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset, or subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated lease. The Company assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Profits or\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nlosses related to intra-entity sales with its equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investments based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees.\nThe carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company's interest in net earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nEquity Securities Investments\nEquity securities investments with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to use the fair value option or apply the measurement alternative, under which investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. The Company reviews for impairment at each reporting period, assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nDebt Securities Investments\nDebt securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company recognizes the impairment using an allowance for credit loss in Interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, while the impairment that is not credit related is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe Company receives fair value to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability, the Company generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of derivative positions. Such measurements involve projecting future cash flows and discounting the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices. In the absence of such data, the Company will use internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued.\nFor a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 12, \"Fair Value\" and Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", respectively.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nContingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record gain contingencies until realized. See Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies\", for a full description of the Company's contingencies.\nWarranties\nThe Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of recognizing revenue. The Company's standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The estimated warranty obligation is based on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of the Company's baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from one to five years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. For certain networking products, the Company offers a lifetime warranty. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately 1.3% of annual net product revenue. Refer to Note 18, \"Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\" for additional information.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn July 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance that requires lessors to classify and account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate as an operating lease, if the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 on a prospective basis, and there was no material impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued guidance to clarify certain interactions between the guidance to account for equity securities, the guidance to account for investments under the equity method of accounting, and the guidance to account for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance clarifies the application of measurement alternatives and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options to acquire investments. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and there was no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued guidance related to troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and vintage disclosures for financing receivables. The amendments eliminate current recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs by creditors while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The amendments also require disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, though early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2: Segment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are organized into six segments for financial reporting purposes: Compute, High Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence (\"HPC & AI\"), Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services (\"FS\"), and Corporate Investments and Other. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), who is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), uses to evaluate, view and run the Company's business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The six segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results. A summary of the types of products and services within each segment is as follows:\nCompute includes both general purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload optimized servers to deliver the best performance and value for demanding applications. This portfolio of products includes the HPE Proliant rack and tower servers and HPE Synergy. Compute offerings also include operational and support services and HPE GreenLake for Compute that provides flexible Compute as-a-service (\"aaS\") IT infrastructure on a consumption basis through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nHPC & AI offers integrated systems comprised of software and hardware designed to address High-Performance Computing (\"HPC\"), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Analytics, and Transaction Processing workloads for government and commercial customers globally. The solutions are segmented into several categories: HPC and Data Solutions. The HPC portfolio of products includes HPE Cray, HPE Apollo and Converged Edge Systems (formerly known as Edge Compute) hardware, software, and data management appliances that are often sold as supercomputing systems, including exascale supercomputers. The Data Solutions portfolio includes the mission critical compute portfolio and HPE NonStop. The mission critical compute portfolio includes the HPE Superdome Flex and HPE Integrity product lines for critical applications including large enterprise software applications and data analytics platforms. The HPE Nonstop portfolio includes high-availability, fault-tolerant, software and appliances that power applications such as credit-card transaction processing that require large scale and high availability. HPC & AI offerings also include operational and support services sold with its systems and as standalone services, and also offers most of its solutions as-a-service through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nStorage provides primary storage product and service offerings, which include software-powered HCI with HPE Nimble Storage Disaggregated HCI and HPE SimpliVity; cloud native primary storage with HPE Primera and HPE Alletra, first storage as-a-service with HPE GreenLake for Block Storage, and disaster recovery and ransomware recovery with Zerto, backup as-a-service with HPE Backup and Recovery Service, and big data solutions running on HPE Apollo servers. Storage also provides solutions for secondary workloads and traditional tape, storage networking and disk products, such as HPE MSA and HPE XP.

The HPE Aruba product portfolio includes hardware products such as Wi-Fi access points, switches and gateways. The HPE Aruba software and services portfolio includes cloud-based management, network management, network access control, analytics and assurance, location services software, and professional and support services, as well as as-a-service and consumption models through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform for the Intelligent Edge portfolio of products. Intelligence Edge offerings are consolidated in the Edge Service Platform (\"Aruba ESP\") which takes a cloud-native approach that provides customers a unified framework to meet their connectivity, security and financial requirements across campus, branch, data center, and remote worker environments.\nFinancial Services provides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, utility programs, and asset management services, for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software, and services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others. FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform.\nCorporate Investments and Other includes the Advisory and Professional Services (\"A & PS\") business which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business (\"CMS\"), which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry; the HPE Software business which offers the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric; and Hewlett Packard Labs which is responsible for research and development.\nSegment Policy\nHewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.\nSegment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by FS to the Company's customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated net revenue is derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.\nFinancing cost in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nHewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated operating costs include certain corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nSegment Operating Results\nCompute HPC & AI Storage Intelligent Edge Financial Services Corporate Investments and Other Total\nIn millions\nFiscal 2022\nNet revenue $ 12,519 $ 3,078 $ 4,654 $ 3,665 $ 3,326 $ 1,254 $ 28,496\nIntersegment net revenue 223 114 57 9 13 1 417\nTotal segment net revenue $ 12,742 $ 3,192 $ 4,711 $ 3,674 $ 3,339 $ 1,255 $ 28,913\nSegment earnings (loss) from operations $ 1,780 $ 11 $ 682 $ 549 $ 399 $ (92) $ 3,329\nFiscal 2021\nNet revenue $ 12,033 $ 3,037 $ 4,678 $ 3,292 $ 3,388 $ 1,356 $ 27,784\nIntersegment net revenue 251 147 82 10 13 - 503\nTotal segment net revenue $ 12,284 $ 3,184 $ 4,760 $ 3,302 $ 3,401 $ 1,356 $ 28,287\nSegment earnings (loss) from operations $ 1,323 $ 231 $ 775 $ 509 $ 390 $ (95) $ 3,133\nFiscal 2020\nNet revenue $ 11,894 $ 3,011 $ 4,589 $ 2,855 $ 3,340 $ 1,293 $ 26,982\nIntersegment net revenue 380 91 93 17 12 5 598\nTotal segment net revenue $ 12,274 $ 3,102 $ 4,682 $ 2,872 $ 3,352 $ 1,298 $ 27,580\nSegment earnings (loss) from operations $ 1,002 $ 282 $ 810 $ 346 $ 284 $ (206) $ 2,518\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe reconciliation of segment operating results to Consolidated Statement of Earnings results was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nNet revenue:\nTotal segments $ 28,913 $ 28,287 $ 27,580\nElimination of intersegment net revenue (417) (503) (598)\nTotal consolidated net revenue $ 28,496 $ 27,784 $ 26,982\nEarnings before taxes:\nTotal segment earnings from operations $ 3,329 $ 3,133 $ 2,518\nUnallocated corporate costs and eliminations (303) (285) (236)\nStock-based compensation expense (391) (372) (274)\nAmortization of initial direct costs (4) (8) (10)\nAmortization of intangible assets (293) (354) (379)\nImpairment of goodwill (905) - (865)\nTransformation costs (473) (930) (950)\nDisaster charges(1)\n(159) (16) (26)\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges (19) (36) (107)\nInterest and other, net (188) (211) (215)\nTax indemnification adjustments (67) 65 (101)\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit 134 70 136\nLitigation judgment - 2,351 -\nEarnings from equity interests 215 180 67\nTotal earnings (loss) before benefit (provision) for taxes $ 876 $ 3,587 $ (442)\n(1)During fiscal year ended 2022, the Company recorded total pre-tax charges of $161 million, primarily related to the Company's exit from its Russia and Belarus businesses. Additionally, in fiscal 2022, Disaster charges included a recovery of $2 million related to COVID-19. Refer to Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", for further information.\nSegment Assets\nHewlett Packard Enterprise allocates assets to its business segments based on the segments primarily benefiting from the assets. Total assets by segment and the reconciliation of segment assets to total assets as per Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nCompute $ 16,872 $ 16,000\nHPC & AI 5,986 6,667\nStorage 7,506 7,325\nIntelligent Edge 4,597 4,355\nFinancial Services 14,837 14,951\nCorporate Investments and Other 1,108 1,210\nCorporate and unallocated assets 6,217 7,191\nTotal assets $ 57,123 $ 57,699\nMajor Customers\nNo single customer represented 10% or more of the Company's total net revenue in any fiscal year presented.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nGeographic Information\nNet revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer location. For each of the fiscal years of 2022, 2021 and 2020, other than the U.S., no country represented more than 10% of the Company's net revenue.\nNet revenue by country was as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nAmericas\nU.S. $ 9,425 $ 8,850 $ 9,162\nAmericas excluding U.S. 1,964 1,825 1,700\nTotal Americas 11,389 10,675 10,862\nEurope, Middle East and Africa 10,292 10,329 9,745\nAsia Pacific and Japan 6,815 6,780 6,375\nTotal consolidated net revenue $ 28,496 $ 27,784 $ 26,982\nProperty, plant and equipment by country in which the Company's operates was as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nU.S. $ 3,035 $ 2,811\nOther countries 2,749 2,802\nTotal property, plant and equipment $ 5,784 $ 5,613\nNote 3: Transformation Programs\nTransformation programs are comprised of the cost optimization and prioritization plan and the HPE Next initiative. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company launched the cost optimization and prioritization plan which focuses on realigning the workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving the Company's product portfolio strategy. The implementation period of the cost optimization and prioritization plan is primarily through fiscal 2023. During the remaining implementation period, Company expects to incur transformation costs predominantly related to labor restructuring, non-labor restructuring, IT investments, design and execution charges and real estate initiatives.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched an initiative called HPE Next to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where it participates. Through this program, the Company is simplifying the operating model, and streamlining its offerings, business processes and business systems to improve its execution of strategy. The implementation period of the HPE Next initiative is primarily through fiscal 2023. During the remaining implementation period, the Company expects to incur predominantly IT infrastructure costs for streamlining, upgrading and simplifying back-end operations, and real estate initiatives. These costs are expected to be offset by gains from real estate sales and sublease income from inactive office space.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nCost Optimization and Prioritization Plan\nThe components of the expense relating to the cost optimization and prioritization plan were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nProgram management $ 27 $ 83 $ 55\nIT costs 26 14 -\nRestructuring charges 201 598 329\nTotal $ 254 $ 695 $ 384\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $253 million, $690 million and $384 million, respectively, were recorded within Transformation costs, and $1 million and $5 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, were recorded within Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nHPE Next\nThe components of transformation costs relating to HPE Next were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nProgram management $ 7 $ 14 $ 35\nIT costs 184 174 100\nRestructuring charges 13 22 440\nGains on real estate sales (8) (3) (45)\nImpairment on real estate assets 11 4 10\nOther 13 29 29\nTotal $ 220 $ 240 $ 569\nDuring fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, $220 million, $240 million and $566 million, respectively, were recorded within Transformation costs, and $3 million was recorded within Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2020.\nRestructuring Plan\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the cost optimization and prioritization plan. As of October 31, 2022, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate charges of approximately $1.3 billion primarily through fiscal 2023 in connection with the cost optimization and prioritization plan which relates to labor restructuring and non-labor restructuring, mostly relating to real estate site exits. The changes to the workforce will vary by country, based on business needs, local legal requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate.\nOn October 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the HPE Next (the \"HPE Next Plan\"), and on September 20, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a revision to that restructuring plan. Headcount exits under the HPE Next Plan were substantially complete as of October 31, 2020. Other restructuring actions primarily related to infrastructure were substantially complete as of October 31, 2022.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nRestructuring activities related to the Company's employees and infrastructure under the cost optimization and prioritization plan and HPE Next Plan, are presented in the table below:\nCost Optimization and Prioritization Plan\nHPE Next Plan\nEmployee\nSeverance Infrastructure\nand other Employee\nSeverance Infrastructure\nand other\nIn millions In millions\nLiability as of October 31, 2021 $ 228 $ 189 $ 44 $ 33\nCharges 138 63 - 13\nCash payments (161) (119) (30) (21)\nNon-cash items (20) (11) (3) -\nLiability as of October 31, 2022 $ 185 $ 122 $ 11 $ 25\nTotal costs incurred to date as of October 31, 2022 $ 645 $ 483 $ 1,261 $ 260\nTotal expected costs to be incurred as of October 31, 2022 $ 700 $ 600 $ 1,261 $ 260\nThe current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, was $191 million and $287 million, respectively, in accrued restructuring, and $28 million and $27 million, respectively, in Other accrued liabilities. The non-current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs, reported in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $124 million and $180 million, respectively.\nNote 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which are the United Kingdom (\"UK\") and Germany plans. The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, however, members continue to earn benefit accruals. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally requires contributions from members. The German pension program that is open to new hires consists of cash balance plans that provide employer credits as a percentage of pay, certain employee pay deferrals and employer matching contributions. There also are previously closed German pension programs that include cash balance and final average pay plans. These previously closed pension programs comprise the majority of the pension obligations in Germany.\nPost-Retirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the U.S. Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (\"RMSA\") upon attaining age 45. Employer credits to the RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use these employer credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company's defined contribution expense was approximately $196 million in fiscal 2022, $170 million in fiscal 2021 and $160 million in fiscal 2020. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan (\"HPE 401(k) Plan\"), when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The HPE 401(k) Plan's quarterly employer matching contributions are 100% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation. Due to cost containment measures put in place in response to COVID-19, the Company suspended the employer match for U.S. employees from July 1, 2020 through the end of the calendar year 2020.\nPension Benefit Expense\nThe Company's net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the table below.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nDefined Benefit Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nIn millions\nService cost $ 78 $ 97 $ 94 $ 1 $ 1 $ 1\nInterest cost(1)\n154 118 143 4 4 5\nExpected return on plan assets(1)\n(450) (479) (544) (2) (1) (1)\nAmortization and deferrals(1):\nActuarial loss (gain) 167 296 264 (2) (2) (1)\nPrior service benefit (10) (13) (14) - - -\nNet periodic benefit cost (61) 19 (57) 1 2 4\nSettlement Loss and Special termination benefits(1)\n5 7 12 - - -\nTotal net benefit (credit) cost $ (56) $ 26 $ (45) $ 1 $ 2 $ 4\n(1)These non-service components of net periodic benefit cost were included in Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the net benefit cost (credit) in the table above for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nDefined Benefit Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDiscount rate used to determine benefit obligation 1.3 % 1.0 % 1.2 % 3.0 % 2.8 % 3.4 %\nDiscount rate used to determine service cost 1.7 % 1.3 % 1.6 % 2.7 % 2.6 % 3.0 %\nDiscount rate used to determine interest cost 1.1 % 0.8 % 1.0 % 2.6 % 2.3 % 3.2 %\nExpected increase in compensation levels 2.6 % 2.5 % 2.5 % - - -\nExpected long-term return on plan assets 3.2 % 3.3 % 4.1 % 3.3 % 2.3 % 2.3 %\nInterest crediting rate(1)\n2.5 % 2.5 % 2.5 % 2.7 % 2.7 % 3.7 %\n(1)The average assumed interest credited for HPE's cash balance plans and postretirement plans, as applicable.\nTo estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that use the yield curve approach, which represent substantially all of the Company's defined benefit plans, the Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFunded Status\nThe funded status of the plans was as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nDefined Benefit Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nIn millions\nChange in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value-beginning of year $ 15,354 $ 14,127 $ 60 $ 57\nTransfers (6) - - -\nAddition/deletion of plans(1)\n- 60 - -\nActual return on plan assets (3,176) 1,256 (3) 2\nEmployer contributions 160 167 6 5\nParticipant contributions 28 23 6 5\nBenefits paid (429) (486) (9) (9)\nSettlement (54) (32) - -\nCurrency impact (1,962) 239 - -\nFair value-end of year $ 9,915 $ 15,354 $ 60 $ 60\nChange in benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation-beginning of year $ 14,872 $ 14,845 $ 161 $ 167\nAddition/deletion of plans(1)\n- 68 - -\nService cost 78 97 1 1\nInterest cost 154 118 4 4\nParticipant contributions 28 23 6 5\nActuarial (gain) loss (3,253) 13 (24) (10)\nBenefits paid (429) (486) (9) (9)\nPlan amendments (1) - - -\nCurtailment - (5) - -\nSettlement (54) (32) - -\nSpecial termination benefits 1 3 - -\nCurrency impact (1,879) 228 (1) 3\nProjected benefit obligation-end of year $ 9,517 $ 14,872 $ 138 $ 161\nFunded status at end of year $ 398 $ 482 $ (78) $ (101)\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 9,376 $ 14,668 $ - $ -\n(1)Includes the addition/deletion of plans resulting from acquisitions.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, the benefit obligation decreased sharply from $14.9 billion to $9.5 billion primarily due to the effects of materially increasing discount rates and the strengthening of the US dollar offset by increases in long-term inflation assumptions for various plans.

Investments in approximately $3 billion and $5 billion of government bonds collateralize this short-term borrowing at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The plans have an obligation to return the cash after the term of the agreements. Due to the short-term nature of the agreements, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.\n(2)Includes a fund that invests in various government bonds issued by worldwide governments, interest rate swaps, and cash, to match or slightly outperform the benchmark of the future liabilities of the fund. While the fund is not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value daily. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(3)Includes funds that invest primarily in asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and/or private debt investments. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and broker quotes and/or 3rd party pricing services. Significant unobservable inputs include yields which are determined by considering the market yield of comparable public debt instruments adjusted for estimated losses to reflect where the expected recovery rate would be less than 100%, and discount rates. The yields ranged from 4% to 18%, with the weighted average around 7%. In the prior year, the yields ranged from 4% to 17%, with the weighted average around 7%. The discount rates ranged from 1% to 5%, with the weighted average around 3%. Generally, an increase in yield and discounted rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n(4)Includes funds, primarily in the UK, that invest in both private and public equities, as well as emerging markets across all sectors. The funds also hold fixed income and derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and inflation risk. In addition, the funds include units in transferable securities, collective investment schemes, money market funds, asset-backed income, cash, and deposits. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and book value or net asset value. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates. The discount rates ranged from 3% to 30%, with the weighted average around 12%. In the prior year, the discount rates ranged from3% to 25%, with the weighted average around 7%. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(5)Includes a pooled fund in the UK, that seeks a rate of return with direct or indirect linkage to UK inflation by investing in vehicles including bonds, long lease property, income strips, asset-backed securities, and index linked assets. Units are available for subscription on the first business day of each calendar month at net asset value. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(6)HPE Invest Common Contractual Funds (CCFs) are investment arrangements in which institutional investors pool their assets. Units may be acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and emerging markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund's investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a month, depending on the sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(7) Includes funds, primarily in Germany, that invest in a diversified portfolio of European real estate assets exposed to logistics real estate properties, food retailing properties, residential and commercial properties, and properties under development. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include the income capitalization approach and cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs include rental yield. The rental yield rates ranged from 3% to 6%, with the weighted average around 4%. Generally, an increase in rental yield rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n(8)Includes life insurance investment policies, unsettled transactions, and derivative instruments. As of October 31, 2022, the derivative instruments include synthetic equity swaps held by the UK plans with equity exposure of $300 million.\nAs of October 31, 2022 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $60 million were invested in publicly traded registered investment entities of which $48 million are classified within Level 1 and $12 million within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

For corporate, government backed debt securities, and some\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nother investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts and alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment and involves a level of uncertainty. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including, but are not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset manager. The use of different techniques or assumptions to estimate fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued based on cost, which approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active market, investments are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nPlan Asset Allocations\nThe weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective measurement dates for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:\nDefined Benefit Plans\nPlan Assets\n2022 Target Allocation 2022 2021\nPublic equity securities 20.3 % 23.0 %\nPrivate/hybrid equity securities 14.2 % 16.7 %\nReal estate and other(1)\n5.2 % 2.7 %\nEquity-related investments(1)\n46.0 % 39.7 % 42.4 %\nDebt securities 52.0 % 53.7 % 54.4 %\nCash and cash equivalents 2.0 % 6.6 % 3.2 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\n(1) Included in Real estate and other investments are synthetic equity swaps with equity exposure of $300 million, which is held in the UK plans as of October 31, 2022.\nFor the Company's post-retirement benefit plans, approximately 81% of the plan assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents and approximately 19% in multi-asset credit investments which consists primarily of investment grade credit, emerging market debt and high yield bonds.\nInvestment Policy\nThe Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nAsset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the specific plan.\nBasis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which considers each country's specific inflation outlook.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nBecause the Company's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns, net of fees.\nEmployer Contributions and Funding Policy\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company contributed approximately $160 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and paid $6 million to cover benefit claims under the Company's post-retirement benefit plans.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company expects to contribute approximately $170 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and an additional $2 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. In addition, the Company expects to pay approximately $7 million to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit plans. The Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities.\nEstimated Future Benefits Payments\nAs of October 31, 2022, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as follows:\nFiscal year Defined\nBenefit Plans Post-Retirement\nBenefit Plans\nIn millions\n2023 $ 515 $ 11\n2024 470 12\n2025 497 11\n2026 512 11\n2027 527 11\nNext five fiscal years to October 31, 2032 2,820 56\nNote 5: Stock-Based Compensation\nOn April 14, 2021 (the \"Approval Date\"), shareholders of the Company approved the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2021 Plan\") that replaced the Companys 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. These awards generally vest over 3 years from the grant date. The maximum number of shares as of the Approval Date that may be delivered to the participants under the 2021 Plan shall not exceed 7 million shares, plus 35.8 million shares that were available for grant under the 2015 Plan and any awards granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the Approval Date that were cash-settled, forfeited, terminated, or lapsed after the Approval Date. On April 5, 2022, shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2021 Plan thereby increasing the overall number of shares available for issuance by 15 million shares. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had remaining authorization of 36.9 million shares under the 2021 Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense and the resulting tax benefits were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nStock-based compensation expense $ 391 $ 382 $ 278\nIncome tax benefit (75) (70) (51)\nStock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 316 $ 312 $ 227\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock-based compensation expense as presented in the table above is recorded within the following cost and expense lines in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nCost of sales $ 46 $ 40 $ 37\nResearch and development 143 124 81\nSelling, general and administrative 202 208 156\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges - 10 4\nStock-based compensation expense $ 391 $ 382 $ 278\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEffective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\").

The ESPP provides for a discount not to exceed 15% and an offering period up to 24 months. The Company currently offers 6-month offering periods during which employees have the ability to purchase shares at 95% of the closing market price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted stock units is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company expenses the fair value of restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for the year ended October 31, 2022:\nShares Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nIn thousands\nOutstanding at beginning of year 45,749 $ 13\nGranted and replacement awards for acquisition\n31,093 $ 15\nVested (20,755) $ 14\nForfeited/canceled (4,185) $ 14\nOutstanding at end of year 51,902 $ 14\nThe total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $262 million, $271 million and $254 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2022, there was $297 million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.3 years.\nPerformance Restricted Units\nThe Company issues performance stock units (\"PSU\") that vest on the satisfaction of service and performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company also issues performance-adjusted restricted stock units (\"PARSU\") that vest only on the satisfaction of service, performance and market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of PARSUs subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The expenses associated with these performance restricted units were not material for any of the periods presented.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the option grant date. The majority of the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company has also issued performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions. The Company did not issue stock options in fiscal 2022 and 2021. The expenses associated with these stock options were not material for any of the periods presented.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model, as these awards contain market conditions.\nNote 6: Taxes on Earnings\nProvision for Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of Net earnings (loss) from operations before taxes were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nU.S. $ (1,138) $ (1,128) $ (2,008)\nNon-U.S. 2,014 4,715 1,566\n$ 876 $ 3,587 $ (442)\nForeign earnings in fiscal 2021 were higher as compared to fiscal 2022 and 2020, primarily as a result of the income from the Itanium litigation judgment.\nThe (Provision) benefit for taxes on Net earnings (loss) from operations were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nU.S. federal taxes:\nCurrent $ (12) $ (26) $ 55\nDeferred 98 79 149\nNon-U.S. taxes:\nCurrent (288) (305) (284)\nDeferred 143 116 133\nState taxes:\nCurrent 43 4 55\nDeferred 8 (28) 12\n$ (8) $ (160) $ 120\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020(1)\nU.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 2.8 % 0.7 % 0.9 %\nLower rates in other jurisdictions, net (0.9) % (7.6) % (2.3) %\nValuation allowance (31.5) % (10.0) % 20.8 %\nU.S. permanent differences 6.0 % 3.6 % (3.4) %\nU.S. R&D credit (5.1) % (1.3) % 8.4 %\nUncertain tax positions (15.6) % (0.9) % 7.6 %\nGoodwill impairment 21.5 % - % (41.2) %\nTax law changes - % (1.1) % 15.5 %\nOther, net 2.7 % 0.1 % (0.2) %\n0.9 % 4.5 % 27.1 %\n(1)Positive percentages represent tax benefits and negative percentages represent tax expense as the Company recorded income tax benefit on a pretax loss.\nThe jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $454 million of net income tax benefits related to various items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $150 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $99 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $43 million of income tax benefits related to the settlement of U.S. tax audit matters, $42 million of income tax benefits related to the release of U.S. passive foreign tax credit valuation allowances, $30 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc.,$27 million of income tax benefits related to the utilization of capital losses which had a full valuation allowance, $12 million of income tax benefits as a result of the fiscal 2021 U.S. tax return filing primarily from the decrease in GILTI, and $11 million of net income tax benefits related to settlements and ongoing discussions in foreign tax audit matters.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company recorded $294 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes, and $32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc. These benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $66 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company was indemnified by HP Inc., $57 million of income tax benefits related to Indian distribution tax rate changes, and $40 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes.\nAs a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2037. The gross foreign income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were $832 million ($0.63 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2022, $889 million ($0.67 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2021, and $521 million ($0.40 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2020. Refer to Note 16, \"Net Earnings Per Share\" for details on shares used to compute diluted net EPS.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of year $ 2,131 $ 2,159 $ 2,269\nIncreases:\nFor current year's tax positions 81 24 27\nFor prior years' tax positions 41 64 40\nDecreases:\nFor prior years' tax positions (48) (31) (71)\nStatute of limitations expiration (12) (44) (17)\nSettlements with taxing authorities (1,491) (15) (53)\nSettlements related to joint and several positions of former Parent (28) (26) (36)\nBalance at end of year $ 674 $ 2,131 $ 2,159\nUp to $386 million, $688 million and $731 million of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, would affect its effective tax rate if realized in their respective periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company effectively settled with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") for fiscal 2016, primarily contributing to the reduction in the Company's unrecognized tax benefits of $1.5 billion, which was predominantly related to the timing of intercompany royalty revenue recognition which does not affect the Companys effective tax rate.\nThe Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company recognized $55 million of interest income, $17 million of interest expense, and $10 million of interest income in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued $81 million and $136 million, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 90 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.\nThe Company engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2017. With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2005. The Company does not expect complete resolution of any other IRS audit cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next 12 months, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions, and other matters. Accordingly, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $21 million within the next 12 months.\nThe Company believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the (Provision) benefit for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.\nThe Company has not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on $9.3 billion of undistributed earnings and basis differences from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2022 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings and basis differences is not practicable. The Company will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nexcess cash has accumulated and the Company determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nDeferred tax assets:\nLoss and credit carryforwards $ 7,222 $ 7,526\nInventory valuation 87 79\nIntercompany prepayments 321 308\nOther intercompany transactions 10 13\nWarranty 61 50\nEmployee and retiree benefits 247 287\nRestructuring 55 93\nDeferred revenue 601 517\nIntangible assets 113 91\nLease liabilities 185 184\nOther 259 246\nTotal deferred tax assets 9,161 9,394\nValuation allowance (6,817) (7,368)\nTotal deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 2,344 2,026\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nUnremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (170) (168)\nROU assets (167) (159)\nFixed assets (200) (170)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (537) (497)\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities $ 1,807 $ 1,529\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nDeferred tax assets $ 2,127 $ 2,023\nDeferred tax liabilities (320) (494)\nDeferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities $ 1,807 $ 1,529\nAs of October 31, 2022, the Company had $420 million, $3.2 billion and $19.1 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in years 2030, 2023, and 2023, respectively.

During fiscal 2022, approximately $3.2 billion of deferred revenue as of October 31, 2021 was recognized as revenue.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract work that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts where the customer is not committed. Remaining performance obligations estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including contract terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.

These receivables typically have terms ranging from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases. The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations. The components of financing receivables were as follows:\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nMinimum lease payments receivable $ 8,686 $ 9,526\nUnguaranteed residual value 380 390\nUnearned income (707) (718)\nFinancing receivables, gross 8,359 9,198\nAllowance for credit losses (325) (228)\nFinancing receivables, net 8,034 8,970\nLess: current portion (3,522) (3,932)\nAmounts due after one year, net $ 4,512 $ 5,038\nAs of October 31, 2022, scheduled maturities of the Company's minimum lease payments receivable were as follows:\nAs of October 31,\nFiscal year In millions\n2023 $ 3,957\n2024 2,293\n2025 1,401\n2026 713\n2027 241\nThereafter 81\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 8,686\nPresent value of lease payments (recognized as finance receivables) $ 7,979\nDifference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows $ 707\nSale of Financing Receivables\nThe Company entered into arrangements to transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing receivables to third party financial institutions. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company sold $183 million and $142 million, respectively, of financing receivables.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nDue to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2022, presented on an amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022\nRisk Rating\nLow Moderate High\nFiscal Year In millions\n2022 $ 1,987 $ 1,277 $ 44\n2021 1,338 1,071 42\n2020 756 571 67\n2019 328 336 69\n2018 and prior 143 234 96\nTotal $ 4,552 $ 3,489 $ 318\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2021, was as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2021\nRisk Rating\nLow Moderate High\nFiscal Year In millions\n2021 $ 1,978 $ 1,542 $ 49\n2020 1,441 1,061 87\n2019 829 771 85\n2018 364 407 78\n2017 and prior 169 234 103\nTotal $ 4,781 $ 4,015 $ 402\nAccounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB- or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower.

The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity (\"SPE\"). The SPE meets the definition of a VIE and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial Statements as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and leased equipment in the capital markets.\nThe Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Zerto's results of operations were included within the Storage segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $416 million primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock and vested in-the-money stock awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $214 million of goodwill, and $212 million of intangible assets after considering the measurement period adjustments. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of seven years.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company completed two acquisitions.

Silver Peak's results of operations were included within the Intelligent Edge segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $879 million consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock, pre-acquisition service of the replacement awards, and vested in-the-money stock awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $561 million of goodwill, and $348 million of intangible assets. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of five years.\nNote 11: Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill and related changes in the carrying amount by reportable segment were as follows:\nCompute\nHPC & AI Storage Intelligent Edge Financial\nServices Corporate Investments & Other Total\nIn millions\nBalance at October 31, 2021(1)\n$ 7,532 $ 3,702 $ 4,160 $ 2,555 $ 144 $ 213 $ 18,306\nImpairment of goodwill - (815) - - - (90) (905)\nGoodwill adjustments - 2 - - - - 2\nBalance at October 31, 2022(1)\n$ 7,532 $ 2,889 $ 4,160 $ 2,555 $ 144 $ 123 $ 17,403\n(1)Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $1.9 billion. Of this amount, $1.7 billion relates to HPC & AI of which $815 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and $865 million was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The Software reporting unit within Corporate Investments and Other, has an accumulated impairment loss of $90 million which was also recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nGoodwill Impairments\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, as of the first day of the fourth quarter, at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2022, the Company's reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, \"Segment Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains three reporting units, Software, CMS and A & PS.\nThe Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in impairment charges for the HPC & AI and Software reporting units of $815 million and $90 million, respectively. There was no impairment of goodwill for the other reporting units.\nThe decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit below its carrying value resulted from changes in expected future cash flows as compared to the Company's fiscal 2021 long-term plan due to the continuation of supply chain constraints, and other operational challenges, as well as an increase in the cost of capital. The fair value estimate of the HPC & AI reporting unit was derived primarily from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach as described in Note 1, Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which the Company considers to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company prepared multiple cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration the historical performance and the current macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions. These multiple cash flow projections were probability weighted to determine a fair value estimate under the income approach. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiple earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit.\nPrior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the HPC & AI reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $815 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe HPC & AI reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of $2.9 billion as of October 31, 2022, and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0% as of the annual test date. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges reflected in the results for the year ended October 31, 2022. The challenges are primarily related to supply chain constraints and other operational challenges impacting the Companys ability to achieve certain customer acceptance milestones required for revenue recognition and resulting cost increases associated with fulfilling contracts over longer than originally anticipated timelines. The Company currently believes these challenges will be successfully addressed when supply chain constraints ease. If the global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen, projected revenue growth rates or operating margins decline, weighted average cost of capital increases, or if the Company has significant or sustained decline in its stock price, it is possible its estimates about the HPC & AI reporting unit's ability to successfully address the current challenges may change, which could result in the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value, and potential impairment charges.\nThe decline in the fair value of the Software reporting unit below its carrying value resulted primarily from a decline in market multiples. The fair value of the Software reporting unit was based on the market approach described in Note 1. Prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the Software reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired. As a result, The Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $90 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.\nThe Software reporting unit has remaining goodwill allocated of $123 million as of October 31, 2022, and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 0% as of the annual test date. As noted above, the fair value of the Software reporting unit is derived from the market approach, which is impacted by market volatility. If global macroeconomic or geopolitical conditions worsen and cause a further decline in the equity market or if revenue expectations are not met, this could result in the carrying value of the Software reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value and potential impairment charges.\nThe excess of fair value over carrying amount for the Companys reporting units, excluding HPC & AI and Software, ranged from approximately 22% to 142% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of the Companys other reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the other reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nBased on the results of the Company's interim and annual impairment tests in fiscal 2021 and the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020, the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed. The macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 which lowered the projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels for the Company resulted in the Company performing an interim impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The interim impairment test concluded that the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit was below the carrying value and the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $865 million.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets comprise:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nGross Accumulated\nAmortization Net Gross Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nIn millions\nCustomer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements $ 475 $ (256) $ 219 $ 472 $ (175) $ 297\nDeveloped and core technology and patents 1,163 (695) 468 1,187 (537) 650\nTrade name and trademarks 144 (98) 46 144 (73) 71\nIn-process research and development - - - 4 - 4\nTotal intangible assets $ 1,782 $ (1,049) $ 733 $ 1,807 $ (785) $ 1,022\nFor fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $29 million of intangible assets which became fully amortized and were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization, partially offset by $4 million of purchase accounting adjustments related to acquisitions.\nFor fiscal 2022, the Company reclassified in-process research and development assets acquired of $4 million to developed and core technology and patents, as the projects were completed, and began amortization. For fiscal 2021, the Company reclassified in-process research and development assets acquired of $113 million to developed and core technology and patents as the projects were completed, and began amortization.\nAs of October 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:\nFinite-Lived Intangible Assets Weighted-Average\nRemaining Useful Lives\nIn years\nCustomer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements 5\nDeveloped and core technology and patents 4\nTrade name and trademarks 2\nAs of October 31, 2022, estimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was as follows:\nFiscal year In millions\n2023 $ 267\n2024 208\n2025 96\n2026 81\n2027 48\nThereafter 33\nTotal $ 733\nNote 12: Fair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1-Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2-Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\nThe following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nFair Value\nMeasured Using Fair Value\nMeasured Using\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nIn millions In millions\nAssets\nCash equivalents and investments:\nTime deposits $ - $ 1,516 $ - $ 1,516 $ - $ 806 $ - $ 806\nMoney market funds 744 - - 744 1,495 - - 1,495\nEquity securities - - 126 126 57 - 129 186\nForeign bonds - 91 - 91 - 122 - 122\nOther debt securities - - 33 33 - - 42 42\nDerivative instruments:\nInterest rate contracts - - - - - 95 - 95\nForeign exchange contracts - 840 - 840 - 308 - 308\nOther derivatives - 2 - 2 - 4 - 4\nTotal assets $ 744 $ 2,449 $ 159 $ 3,352 $ 1,552 $ 1,335 $ 171 $ 3,058\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments:\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ 178 $ - $ 178 $ - $ - $ - $ -\nForeign exchange contracts - 128 - 128 - 127 - 127\nOther derivatives - 1 - 1 - - - -\nTotal liabilities $ - $ 307 $ - $ 307 $ - $ 127 $ - $ 127\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy.\nValuation Techniques\nCash Equivalents and Investments: The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds. The Company values cash equivalents using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt and equity investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data. Equity and other securities include investments in marketable and non-marketable\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nsecurities. In evaluating non-marketable securities for impairment or observable price changes, the Company uses valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and counterparties' credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nShort- and Long-Term Debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own credit risk. The portion of the Company's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. As of October 31, 2022, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $12.2 billion and the carrying value was $12.5 billion. As of October 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $14.6 billion and the carrying value was $13.4 billion. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOther Financial Instruments: For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value: Equity Investments are recorded at cost and measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized an unrealized net loss of $17 million, which included a $24 million impairment charge, and unrealized gains of $64 million and $19 million, respectively, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material impairment charges relating to equity investments. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These adjustments are based on observable price changes for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair value.\nNon-Financial Assets: The Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records ROU assets based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $5 million, $89 million and $74 million, respectively, in Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as the carrying value of certain ROU assets exceeded its fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $905 million associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit and the Software reporting unit within the Corporate Investments and Other segment. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $865 million associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit. The fair value of the Company's reporting units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. For more information on the goodwill impairment, see Note 11, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 13: Financial Instruments\nCash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Investments\nCash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nCost Gross\nUnrealized\nGains/(Losses) Fair\nValue Cost Gross\nUnrealized\nGains/(Losses) Fair\nValue\nIn millions\nCash Equivalents:\nTime deposits $ 1,516 $ - $ 1,516 $ 806 $ - $ 806\nMoney market funds 744 - 744 1,495 - 1,495\nTotal cash equivalents 2,260 - 2,260 2,301 - 2,301\nAvailable-for-Sale Investments:\nForeign bonds 93 (2) 91 108 14 122\nOther debt securities 32 1 33 41 1 42\nTotal available-for-sale investments 125 (1) 124 149 15 164\nTotal cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments $ 2,385 $ (1) $ 2,384 $ 2,450 $ 15 $ 2,465\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $39 million, $18 million and $44 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.\nContractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022\nAmortized Cost Fair Value\nIn millions\nDue in one year $ 19 $ 19\nDue in more than five years 106 105\n$ 125 $ 124\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These non-marketable equity investments are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative.\nThe carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative was $175 million and $253 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded an unrealized net loss of $17 million, which included a $24 million impairment charge, and unrealized gains of $64 million and $19 million respectively, on these investments. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no material impairment charges relating to equity investments.\nThe carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the fair value option was $126 million and $129 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, 2021, the Company recorded unrealized gains of $86 million and $50 million respectively, on these investments. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2022, the Company sold $165 million of these investments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There were no such equity investments as of October 31, 2022 as the Company completed the sale of these investments. The carrying amount of such equity investments was $57 million as of October 31, 2021.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nInvestments in equity securities that are accounted for using the equity method are included in Investments in equity interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounted to $2.2 billion at October 31, 2022 and 2021. For additional information, see Note 20, \"Equity Method Investments.\"\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (\"net investment hedges\"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to the Company from the same counterparty under certain conditions.\nTo further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements, which allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Conversely, if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within two business days. The fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $106 million and $3 million at October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.\nUnder the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend up to five years.\nThe Company used interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with its variable-rate debt due to changes in the U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate. The swap transactions generally involved principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. There were no cash flow hedges related to interest rate contracts in fiscal 2022.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is recognized.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nHedge Effectiveness\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe gross notional and fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022 As of October 31, 2021\nFair Value Fair Value\nOutstanding\nGross\nNotional Other\nCurrent\nAssets Long-Term\nFinancing\nReceivables\nand Other\nAssets Other\nAccrued\nLiabilities Long-Term\nOther\nLiabilities Outstanding\nGross\nNotional Other\nCurrent\nAssets Long-Term\nFinancing\nReceivables\nand Other\nAssets Other\nAccrued\nLiabilities Long-Term\nOther\nLiabilities\nIn millions\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate contracts $ 2,500 $ - $ - $ - $ 178 $ 3,850 $ 15 $ 80 $ - $ -\nCash flow hedges:\nForeign currency contracts 7,662 420 246 25 13 7,664 125 68 49 32\nNet investment hedges:\nForeign currency contracts 1,883 60 74 12 13 1,860 33 40 12 18\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments 12,045 480 320 37 204 13,374 173 188 61 50\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nForeign currency contracts 7,780 36 4 53 12 6,994 25 17 16 -\nOther derivatives 95 2 - 1 - 113 4 - - -\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 7,875 38 4 54 12 7,107 29 17 16 -\nTotal derivatives $ 19,920 $ 518 $ 324 $ 91 $ 216 $ 20,481 $ 202 $ 205 $ 77 $ 50\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Diluted net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based awards.\nThe reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of each of the basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nNumerator:\nNet earnings (loss) $ 868 $ 3,427 $ (322)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares used to compute basic net EPS 1,303 1,309 1,294\nDilutive effect of employee stock plans 19 21 -\nWeighted-average shares used to compute diluted net EPS 1,322 1,330 1,294\nNet earnings (loss) per share:\nBasic $ 0.67 $ 2.62 $ (0.25)\nDiluted $ 0.66 $ 2.58 $ (0.25)\nAnti-dilutive weighted-average stock awards(1)\n2 6 49\n(1)The Company excludes shares potentially issuable under employee stock plans that could dilute basic net EPS in the future from the calculation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share, as their effect, if included, would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.\nNote 17: Litigation and Contingencies\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits, and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (the \"Separation and Distribution Agreement\") entered into in connection with Hewlett Packard Enterprise's spin-off from HP Inc. (formerly known as \"Hewlett-Packard Company\") (the \"Separation\"), Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\npending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2022, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its financial statements.\nLitigation, Proceedings and Investigations\nRoss and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. On November 8, 2018, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-based female employees \"systemically lower compensation\" than HPE pays male employees performing substantially similar work. The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California's Equal Pay Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only class of female employees employed in certain \"Covered Positions.\" The complaint seeks damages, statutory and civil penalties, attorneys' fees and costs. On April 2, 2019, HPE filed a demurrer to all causes of action and an alternative motion to strike portions of the complaint. On July 2, 2019, the court denied HPEs demurrer as to the claims of the putative class and granted HPE's demurrer as to the claims of the individual plaintiffs. The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this litigation. The terms of the class settlement are reflected in Plaintiffs Motion for Preliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement and Certification of Settlement Class, which was filed with the Court on September 26, 2022. On November 3, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs motion and preliminarily approved the terms of the class settlement, which defines the settlement class as all [w]omen actively employed in California by Defendant at any point from November 1, 2015 through the date of Preliminary Approval who were employed in a covered job code. The settlement class excludes certain individuals, including those who previously executed an arbitration agreement with HPE or an agreement that resulted in a release or waiver of claims. The hearing on final approval of the class settlement is scheduled for April 27, 2023.\nIndia Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings. On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the \"DRI\") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd (\"HP India\"), a subsidiary of HP Inc., seven HP India employees and one former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties. Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.\nOn April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India had already deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice to avoid certain penalties.\nHP India filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings were scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015,\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nand again on November 3, 2015, April 11, 2016, and January 15, 2019, but were canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. The hearing was again rescheduled for January 20, 2021 but was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled.\nECT Proceedings. In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Tel\u00e9grafos (\"ECT\"), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (\"HP Brazil\") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. HP Brazil expects any appeal of the decision on the merits to last several years.\nForsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This purported class and collective action was filed on August 18, 2016 and an amended complaint was filed on December 19, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of all individuals age 40 years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (\"WFR\") plan on or after December 9, 2014 for individuals terminated in deferral states and on or after April 8, 2015 in non-deferral states. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all persons 40 years or older employed by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. Following the filing of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Class Certification on December 30, 2020. On April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or after November 1, 2015, and who were 40 years or older at the time of such termination. The collective action excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. The Court-approved notice was issued to potential class members and the opt-in period is now closed.\nHewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle (Itanium). On June 15, 2011, HP Inc. filed suit against Oracle in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara in connection with Oracle's March 2011 announcement that it was discontinuing software support for HP Inc.'s Itanium-based line of mission critical servers. HP Inc. asserted, among other things, that Oracle's actions breached the contract that was signed by the parties as part of the settlement of the litigation relating to Oracle's hiring of Mark Hurd. Trial was bifurcated into two phases. HP Inc. prevailed in the first phase of the trial, in which the court ruled that the contract at issue required Oracle to continue to offer its software products on HP Inc.'s Itanium-based servers for as long as HP Inc. decided to sell such servers. Phase 2 of the trial was then postponed by Oracle's appeal of the trial court's denial of Oracle's \"anti-SLAPP\" motion, in which Oracle argued that HP Inc.'s damages claim infringed on Oracle's First Amendment rights. On August 27, 2015, the California Court of Appeal rejected Oracle's appeal. The matter was remanded to the trial court for Phase 2 of the trial, which began on May 23, 2016, and was submitted to the jury on June 29, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP Inc., awarding HP Inc. approximately $3.0 billion in damages: $1.7 billion for past lost profits and $1.3 billion for future lost profits. On October 20, 2016, the court entered judgment for this amount with interest accruing until the judgment is paid. Oracle's motion for a new trial was denied on December 19, 2016, and Oracle filed its notice of appeal from the trial court's judgment on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP Inc. filed a notice of cross-appeal challenging the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest. On May 16, 2019, HP Inc. filed its application to renew the judgment. As of May 16, 2019, the renewed judgment is approximately $3.8 billion. Daily interest on the renewed judgment is now accruing at $1 million and will be recorded upon receipt. On June 14, 2021, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Oracle filed a Petition for Rehearing with the California Court of Appeal, which was denied on July 8, 2021. On July 26, 2021, Oracle filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court denied the petition on September 29, 2021, and the California Court of Appeal issued the remittitur on September 30, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Oracle paid $4.66 billion, reflecting all amounts owed on the judgment plus accrued interest. Pursuant to the\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nterms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement between HP Inc. and HPE, this amount was split evenly between the parties following the reimbursement of approximately $48 million in pre-separation legal costs incurred by HPE in prosecution of the litigation. In total, HPE has received payment of approximately $2.35 billion, which was recognized as a gain from litigation judgment during the year ended October 31, 2021. On October 27, 2021, HP Inc. filed an acknowledgement of full satisfaction of judgment. On January 27, 2022, Oracle filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari asking the United States Supreme Court to grant review. On May 16, 2022, the United States Supreme Court denied Oracle's Petition. The matter is now closed.\nOracle America, Inc., et al. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Terix copyright matter). On March 22, 2016, Oracle filed a complaint against HPE in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement, interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and unfair competition. Oracles claims arise out of HPE's prior use of a third-party maintenance provider named Terix Computer Company, Inc. (\"Terix\"). Oracle contends that in connection with HPE's use of Terix as a subcontractor for certain customers of HPE's multivendor support business, Oracle's copyrights were infringed, and HPE is liable for vicarious and contributory infringement and related claims. The lawsuit against HPE follows a prior lawsuit brought by Oracle against Terix in 2013 relating to Terix's alleged unauthorized provision of Solaris patches to customers on Oracle hardware. On January 29, 2019, the court granted HPE's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of Oracle's claims. On February 20, 2019, the court entered judgment in favor of HPE, dismissing Oracle's claims in their entirety. Oracle appealed the trial court's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 20, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling, affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of HPE. On October 6, 2020, the matter was remanded to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On June 4, 2021, the Court issued an order denying HPEs motion for summary judgment and granting-in-part Oracles motion for partial summary judgment as to a certain of HPEs defenses. Trial began on May 23, 2022. On June 15, 2022, the jury returned its verdict, awarding $30 million in compensatory damages to Oracle and rejecting Oracles request for punitive damages. Judgment has not yet been entered by the Court as the parties are engaged in post-verdict motion practice on multiple issues, including HPEs Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and Oracles request for an award of prejudgment interest and attorneys fees. The parties have since reached an agreement to resolve this dispute. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, the case will be dismissed, and the matter closed.\nQ3 Networking Litigation. On September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (ITC). Both complaints allege infringement of four patents, and the ITC complaint defines the accused products as routers, access points, controllers, network management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof. The ITC action was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC action. The evidentiary hearing before the ITC has been completed. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act. On May 3, 2022, the ITC issued its Notice of Final Determination, affirming the initial determination and terminating the investigation. On June 18, 2022, Q3 Networking filed a petition for review of the ITC ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nShared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus\nAs part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the substances and materials used in the Company's products, the energy consumption of products, services, and operations and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as \"product take-back\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nlegislation\"). The Company could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those related to addressing climate change and other environmental related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nIn particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), known as \"Superfund,\" or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc.\nNote 18: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.\nThe Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.\nGeneral Cross-indemnifications\nIn connection with the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus respectively, whereby the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions. Similarly, HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle Transactions.\nTax Matters Agreement with DXC/Micro Focus and Other Income Tax Matters\nIn connection with the Everett Transaction and the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and Micro Focus respectively (the \"DXC Tax Matters Agreement\" and the \"Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement\"). The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement govern the rights and obligations of the Company and DXC/Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provide that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nauthorities to the Company's and DXC's, or Micro Focus', as applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, the Company and DXC/Micro Focus have joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.\nIn addition, if the distribution of Everett's or Seattle's common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stockholders is determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of the distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC/Micro Focus, in which case DXC/Micro Focus would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's receivable and payable balances related to indemnified litigation matters and other contingencies, and income tax-related indemnification covered by these agreements were as follows:\nAs of October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nLitigation matters and other contingencies\nReceivable $ 47 $ 54\nPayable $ 50 $ 53\nIncome tax-related indemnification(1)\nNet indemnification receivable - long-term\n$ 7 $ 50\nNet indemnification receivable - short-term\n$ 11 $ 11\n(1)The actual amount that the Company may receive or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.\nWarranties\nThe Company's aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes therein were as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021\nIn millions\nBalance at beginning of year $ 327 $ 385\nCharges 238 203\nAdjustments related to pre-existing warranties (2) (27)\nSettlements made (203) (234)\nBalance at end of year(1)\n$ 360 $ 327\n(1)The Company included the current portion in Other accrued liabilities, and amounts due after one year in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 19: Commitments\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nAs of October 31, 2022, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $1.6 billion. These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction, as well as settlements that the Company has reached with third parties, requiring it to pay determined amounts over a specified period of time. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchases, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. The Company expects the commitments to total $449 million, $186 million, $273 million, $301 million, $327 million, and $14 million for fiscal years 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and thereafter, respectively.\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNote 20: Equity Method Investments\nThe Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments in equity interests on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's Investments in equity interests was $2.2 billion and primarily related to a 49% equity interest in H3C Technologies (\"H3C\").\nIn the periods presented, the Company recorded its interest in the net earnings of H3C, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP on a one-month lag, along with an adjustment to eliminate unrealized profits on intra-entity sales, and the amortization of basis difference, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe difference between the sale date carrying value of the Company's investment in H3C and its proportionate share of the net assets fair value of H3C, created a basis difference of $2.5 billion, which was allocated as follows:\nIn millions\nEquity method goodwill $ 1,674\nIntangible assets 749\nIn-process research and development 188\nDeferred tax liabilities (152)\nOther 75\nBasis difference $ 2,534\nThe Company amortizes the basis difference over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to this difference. The weighted-average life of the H3C intangible assets is five years and is being amortized using the straight-line method. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that no impairment of its equity method investments existed.\nEarnings from equity interest\nThe Company recorded earnings from equity interests of $215 million, $180 million and $67 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which are as follows:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nIn millions\nEarnings from equity interests, net of taxes(1)\n$ 270 $ 292 $ 211\nBasis difference amortization (45) (109) (145)\nElimination of profit on intra-entity sales adjustment\n(10) (3) 1\nEarnings from equity interests $ 215 $ 180 $ 67\n(1) In fiscal 2022 and 2021, earnings from equity interests, net of taxes included $275 million and $260 million from H3C and ($5) million and $32 million from other venture investments, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company received a cash dividend of $197 million and $184 million, respectively, from H3C. This amount was accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in the carrying balance of the Company's Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers, storage and networking products and services. During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, HPE recorded approximately $848 million, $794 million and $737 million of sales to H3C and $148 million, $150 million and $215 million of purchases from H3C, respectively. Payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were approximately $22 million and $32 million, respectively.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to the Company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nSee Management's Report of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on our internal control over financial reporting in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. Other Information.\nThe following disclosure is being made under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act:\nOn March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) as a party subject to the provisions of U.S. Executive Order No. 13382 issued in 2005 (Executive Order 13382). On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) updated General License 1B (General License 1B) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local subsidiary is required to engage on a regular basis with the FSB as a licensing authority and to file documents. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB and all such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to support our orderly and managed wind down of our Russia operations.\nOn April 15, 2021, the U.S. Government issued an executive order on Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation (Executive Order 14024), implementing additional U.S. sanctions against the Russian government and against Russian actors that threaten U.S. interests, including certain technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Service. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies) under Executive Order 14024 and Executive Order 13382. HPEs local Russian subsidiary had dealings with Positive Technologies prior to its designation. Following the sanctions designation, our local subsidiary immediately initiated procedures to terminate its relationship with Positive Technologies. HPE does not plan to engage in any further transactions with this entity, except wind down activities that are authorized by OFAC going forward. In this reporting period, HPE did not have dealings with Positive Technologies, and there are no identifiable gross revenues or net profits associated with HPEs relationship with Positive Technologies for this reporting period.\nDuring the reporting period, HPEs German affiliate, Hewlett-Packard GmbH, entered into an agreement to provide support services to Tara Steel Trading GmbH (Tara Steel) in Germany. The agreement, valued at approximately \u20ac3,400, was a renewal of a services agreement in connection with a 2017 sale of hardware via a distributor. In 2018, Tara Steel became a blocked party due to its status as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mobarakeh Steel Company, which became subject to U.S. blocking sanctions under Executive Order 13224 on October 16, 2018. Based on HPEs preliminary internal review, the total value of HPEs prior dealings with Tara Steel, including the renewal agreement entered into during the reporting period, the\nunderlying indirect 2017 hardware sale, the original service agreement in connection with such sale, and a renewal in 2020, was approximately \u20ac21,000. Related to Tara Steel, HPE has estimated that for this reporting period, the corresponding net revenue is \u20ac685.25 and net profit is \u20ac411.15. HPEs affiliate has since terminated the subject service agreement and does not intend to engage in any further transactions with this entity.\nFor a summary of our revenue recognition policies, see \"Revenue Recognition\" described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II.\nITEM 9C.
