    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOur Company\ni3 Verticals builds, acquires and grows software solutions in strategic vertical markets. Our broad array of specialized solutions meet our customers specific enterprise needs which leads to long-term partnerships. Our payments platform seamlessly integrates into our solutions, unlocking additional value.\nRevenue from software and related services accounts for 49% of our total revenue in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, up from 5% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2017.\nSince founding in 2012, we have steadily increased our market share and solution breadth through a combination of organic growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our compounding cash flow generation has positioned us to capitalize on strategic opportunities and position ourselves to expand our product offerings for years to come.\nWe focus on strategic vertical markets where we can build lasting customer relationships. Our primary markets are underserved, fragmented, large, and growing. Our primary strategic vertical markets include:\nPublic Sector-We have products and solutions that create an efficient flow of information throughout a variety of public sector entities, including states and local governments. Our solutions help our customers provide more responsive and efficient services to their citizens. We have products that enable upper and lower court case management, collections, finance and accounting, motor vehicle and carrier registration, e-filing and taxation, license plate inventory, property tax management, utility billing, professional licensing, document workflow, and law enforcement software. We deliver integrated payments solutions throughout many of these products and these solutions allow our customers to efficiently process court, tax, registration, utility and other payments. We also assist public schools in completing payment processing functions such as accepting payments for school lunches (online or at school) and school activities.\nHealthcare-We provide businesses in our Healthcare vertical with software platforms for revenue cycle management, including coding, insurance adjudication, billing, scheduling and integrated payments. Our solutions help our customers efficiently code and bill for their services, and ultimately receive reimbursement. We offer our software as a service and bundle it with professional services that specialize in outsourced revenue cycle management. We also offer electronic health records (\"EHR\") solutions and often pair these with our revenue cycle management services. Our payment solutions in the healthcare market seamlessly integrate into our own proprietary software, as well as that of our distribution partners, consisting of independent software vendors (ISVs). We also provide workflow software and associated professional services to medical insurance payers.\nA core component of our growth strategy includes a disciplined approach to acquisitions of companies and technology, evidenced by more than 47 acquisitions since our inception in 2012. Our acquisitions have opened new strategic vertical markets, increased the number of businesses and organizations to whom we provide solutions and extended our existing software solutions and capabilities. We target vertical markets where businesses and organizations often lack integrated payment functionality within their business management systems. When we present software solutions that integrate the customer's operations with their payments, we can build a long-term relationship primed to grow together. Our management team has significant experience acquiring and integrating vertical market software businesses that complement our existing suite of products and solutions. Due to our teams longstanding relationships and domain expertise, we maintain a strong pipeline of acquisition targets and are constantly evaluating businesses against our acquisition criteria.\nWe generate revenue from software licenses and subscriptions, ongoing support, and other software-related solutions. We also generate revenue from volume-based fees generated by payment processing services provided to customers throughout North America. Our software and integrated payment solutions coupled with our distribution network derive significant scale from operating efficiencies, which enables us to generate strong operating margins and cash flows.\nOur Segments\nWe have two reportable segments, Merchant Services and Software and Services (formerly known as Proprietary Software and Payments), and an Other category. For additional information on our segments, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nMerchant Services\nOur Merchant Services segment provides comprehensive payment solutions to businesses and organizations. Our Merchant Services segment includes third-party integrated payment solutions as well as traditional merchant processing services across our strategic vertical markets.\nSoftware and Services\nOur Software and Services segment delivers vertical market software solutions to customers across all of our strategic vertical markets. These solutions often include embedded payments or other recurring services.\nOther\nOur Other category includes corporate overhead expenses, when presenting reportable segment information.\nOur Products and Solutions\nWe deliver a comprehensive array of vertical market software solutions and integrated payment technology to our customers and distribution partners. Our products and solutions are strategically aligned to support new customer growth and promote customer retention.

Capabilities include:\ntraditional merchant processing or payment facilitator models,\nintegration with customer business management systems, risk management,\nvalidated point-to-point encryption, and\nPCI-compliant security and extensive reporting tools.\nWe offer our customers a single point of access through our powerful, simple and capable proprietary core platform. From there we offer a suite of payment and software solutions, enabling omni-channel POS, spanning brick and mortar locations and electronic- and mobile-commerce, including app-based payments.\nOur payment technology platforms include an Application Programming Interface (API) suite that provides access to traditional merchant processing, ACH processing and payment facilitator merchant processing capabilities. The platform APIs allow access to Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) devices using an\nimplementation that shields software providers from the requirements of PCI or payment application data security standard certifications.\nOur Technology\nOur technology offerings are architected and delivered utilizing a variety of strategies designed to maximize business value for customers. Software is delivered via agile development methodologies allowing for immediate customer feedback. Our cloud-first strategy takes advantage of cost-effective, secure, and scalable infrastructures. We focus intently on cybersecurity and we proactively work to continuously improve the security of customer information and our internal systems. We leverage test automation and automated deployment tools to ensure seamless, high quality software deployments.\nAgile Development\nOur software development lifecycle has been designed to incorporate agile methodologies that are intended to maximize business value to our customers as well as create an environment for continuous feedback. This feedback is rapidly incorporated into our product backlogs and prioritized for development. Quality assurance is incorporated into the process from the beginning, allowing for high quality technology delivery.\nCloud First Strategy\nWe have both public cloud and private cloud solutions. Our primary public cloud provider is AWS. However, we also leverage Microsoft and Google to deliver our technology across multiple cloud platforms. Our strategy is focused on leveraging Platforms as a Service whenever possible to ensure the highest level of scalability at a lower cost level. In situations where the public cloud is not a fit, we have a private cloud solution to host our technology. The public cloud spans multiple data centers across the country. Within each data center, we have implemented a highly available infrastructure utilizing a variety of cybersecurity tools to ensure systems are always on and highly secured.\nLow code\nWe have recently identified low code partner. We intend to deploy this leading-edge technology to efficiently build critical technology for customers at a lower cost and at a more rapid pace.\nAutomation\nWe are investing heavily in technology automation. This allows us to bring changes to the marketplace much faster than traditional mechanisms. Additionally, we continue to invest in test automation, which reduces the risk of quality issues while improving overall test coverage. These two technologies help enable the delivery of new technology with high levels of quality.\nOur Sales and Marketing\nOur sales strategy includes both direct W2 sales representatives and a broad network of distribution partners.\nWe utilize our direct sales team, our largest channel, to sell our proprietary software and payment technology solutions directly to customers in our vertical markets. Sales teams are organized and coordinated by vertical, leading to extensive cross-selling opportunities across our broad array of solutions. Leveraging our vertically focused suite of products and services, we are able to maximize the performance of our direct W2 sales force, and our external distribution channels, as we continue to attract new partners.\nOur external channel partners are comprised of ISVs, value-added resellers (VARs) and a few select independent sales organizations (ISOs). These distribution partners are a consistent and scalable source for new customer acquisition.\nOur product and partner marketing is delivered through a shared-services model which is coordinated with each business unit. Marketing is tightly aligned with our sales efforts by providing event coordination, demand generation resources, physical and electronic marketing campaigns and partner marketing collateral. Our enterprise marketing function establishes our overall corporate marketing strategy to enhance brand awareness and demand generation. We use a broad variety of traditional and digital marketing mediums to engage prospective customers.\nOur Operations\nOur operations team is uniquely structured to optimize the experience of our customers and distribution partners. These vertically focused business support teams allow us to establish a level of expertise that delivers a scalable support structure and enables us to align our services with the economic goals and specific expectations of the respective business unit. Each operations team is positioned to support the functions of their respective customer base and key performance indicators mark their progress toward achieving the goals established by each business unit. A strong network of shared services, such as marketing, legal, finance and HR, support our decentralized operating units and ensure that they are focused on the best in-class service to our customers. Our corporate technology department is structured to rapidly enhance and effectively maintain our products and services.\nOur operations team is structured to effectively support the individual needs of our customers. This support includes:\ncustomer onboarding and data conversions;\nsoftware configurations and integrations;\ncustomer support and retention;\ncustomer training and activations;\nbilling and financial review;\ncredit underwriting and risk management;\npayment processing support; and\nend-user customer support.\nOur technical operations team oversees the execution of development, quality control, delivery and support for our vertical software and payment processing applications. Applications are developed and tested according to the software development lifecycle, composed of iterative development and testing with a dedicated focus on planning and execution. Releases are modeled on continuous deployment and added to the live environment on a routine basis. Each application stack is built with redundancy to foster resiliency and built to be easily managed during a disaster recovery scenario. The entire solution is hosted within a managed, dedicated environment that is certified PCI-compliant to protect all personal and transactional data.\nOur Competition\nWe compete with a variety of vertical market software providers that have different business models, go-to-market strategies and technical capabilities. We believe the most significant competitive factors in our markets are:\n1.quality, including the ability of our products and solutions to addresses the specific needs of our customers;\n2.service, including our ability to bring value-added solutions and strong customer support;\n3.trust, including a strong reputation for quality service and trusted distribution partners;\n4.convenience, such as speed in customer onboarding and approving applications;\n5.pricing, including fees charged to customers and residuals and incentives offered to distribution partners.\nOur competitors range from large and well established companies to smaller, earlier-stage businesses. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry- The vertical market software and payment processing industries are highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the revenue we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The following risk factors, some of which contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements, should be read in conjunction with Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may in the future affect our operations, business and financial condition, and our liquidity could also be negatively impacted, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices, and may in the future impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and public confidence in such vaccines and treatments, and the extent and duration of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business and government shutdowns. Refer to Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our financial results for fiscal year 2022. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict.\nThere are no reliable estimates of how long the pandemic will last, how many people are likely to be affected by it or the duration or types of restrictions (such as schools or business closings) that will be imposed. While the COVID-19 pandemic is having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, the extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which cannot be accurately predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in lower results of operations due to a number of operational factors, including:\nthe temporary closures, re-closures and failures of our customers; which creates risk of chargeback liability and delayed payment or failure to pay by our customers for our solutions and services\nthird-party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers;\nincreased cyber and payment fraud risk related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity; and\nchallenges to the availability and reliability of our solutions and services due to changes to operations, including the possibility of COVID-19 cases occurring at our locations, affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our customers or other third parties on which we depend.\nSince the outbreak, the market price per share of our common stock has been volatile. If general economic conditions were to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline. If the stock price were to decrease significantly, it may cause a triggering event for impairment testing of fair-valued assets, including goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has previously caused disruption in the financial markets and the businesses of financial institutions and may do so again, potentially causing a slowdown in the decision-making of these institutions. This may affect the timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds, in the form of debt or equity, or to amend our Senior Secured Credit Facility on terms acceptable to us, if at all, even if we determined such actions were necessary in the future.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, financial condition, cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described herein.\nWe have a history of operating losses and will need to generate significant revenues to attain and maintain profitability and positive cash flow and continue our acquisition program.\nSince inception in 2012, we have been engaged in growth activities and have made a significant number of acquisitions that have grown our business. This acquisition activity requires substantial capital and other expenditures. As a result, 2017 was the first fiscal year for which we attained profitability, and we incurred net losses attributable to i3 Verticals, Inc. in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and we may incur losses again in the future. A substantial portion of our historical revenue growth has resulted from acquisitions. For the year ended September 30, 2022, revenues attributable to the acquisitions we completed in 2021 and 2022 were $61.8 million, or 19.5% of our total revenues. We expect our cash needs to increase significantly for the next several years as we:\nmake additional acquisitions;\nmarket our products and services;\nexpand our customer support and service operations;\nhire additional marketing, customer support and administrative personnel; and\nimplement new and upgraded operational and financial systems, procedures and controls.\nAs a result of these continuing costs and expenses, we need to generate significant revenues to attain and maintain profitability and positive cash flow. To date, our operations have been supported by equity and debt financings. If we do not continue to increase our revenues, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe vertical market software and payment processing industries are highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect the revenue we receive, and as a result, our margins, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for payment processing services is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. Other providers of payment processing services have established a sizable market share in the merchant acquiring sector and service more customers than we do. Our growth will depend, in part, on a combination of the continued growth of the electronic payment market and our ability to increase our market share.\nOur payment and software solutions compete against many peers. Our competitors include, among others, Tyler Technologies, Inc., EverCommerce, Inc., EngageSmart, LLC, GTY Technology Holdings, Inc., Constellation Software, Inc., Global Payments, Inc., Stripe, Inc., and Square, Inc.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, and marketing resources than we have. Accordingly, if these competitors specifically target our business model, they may be able to offer more attractive solutions to our customers and more attractive compensation to our distribution partners. They also may be able to offer and provide products and services that we do not offer. Additionally, larger financial institutions may decide to perform in-house some or all of the services we provide or could provide, which may give them with a competitive advantage in the market. There are also a large number of small providers of vertical market software services or payment processing services that provide various ranges of services to our customers and our potential customers. This competition may effectively limit the prices we can charge and requires us to control costs aggressively in order to maintain acceptable profit margins. Competition could also result in a loss of existing distribution partners and customers and greater difficulty attracting new distribution partners and customers. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are also subject to risks as a result of changes in business habits of our vendors and customers as they adjust to the competitive marketplace. Because our standing arrangements and agreements with our vendors and customers typically contain no purchase or sale obligations and are terminable by either party upon no or relatively short notice, we are subject to significant risks associated with the loss or change at any time in the business habits and financial condition of key vendors as they adapt to changes in the market.\nTo acquire and retain customers, we depend in part on distribution partners that generally do not serve us exclusively, may not aggressively market our products and services, are subject to attrition and are not under our control.\nWe rely heavily on the efforts of our distribution partners to market our products and services to existing customers and potential customers. Generally, our agreements with distribution partners are not exclusive and these partners retain the right to refer potential customers to other merchant acquirers. Gaining and maintaining loyalty or exclusivity may require financial concessions to maintain current distribution partners or to attract potential distribution partners from our competitors who may be offering significantly more enticing pricing terms, such as increased signing bonuses or residuals payable to our referral partners, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. If these distribution partners switch to another merchant acquirer, focus more heavily on promoting the products and services of one or more other merchant acquirers, cease operations or become insolvent, we may no longer receive new referrals from them or may receive fewer new referrals from them, and we also risk losing existing customers with whom the distribution partner has a relationship. Additionally, some of our distribution partners are subject to the requirements imposed by our bank sponsors, which may result in fines to them for non-compliance and may, in some cases, result in these entities ceasing to market our products and services. If we are unable to maintain our existing base of distribution partners or develop relationships with new distribution partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Further, we may be named in legal proceedings in connection with the actions of our distribution partners where it is alleged that our distribution partners have intentionally or negligently misrepresented pricing or other contractual terms to customers or potential customers related to our processing solutions or related products. Our distribution partners are independent businesses and we have no control over their day-to-day business activities, including their customer marketing and solicitation practices. While in some cases we may have indemnification rights against our distribution partners for these activities, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully enforce those indemnification rights or that our distribution partners are adequately capitalized in a manner necessary to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us. If one or more judgments or settlements in any litigation or other investigation, plus related defense and investigation costs, significantly exceed our insurance coverage and we are unable to enforce our indemnification rights against a distribution partner or partners, our business, financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer.\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid developments and changes in our industry, the use of our products and services could decline, causing a reduction in our revenues.\nThe electronic payments market is subject to constant and significant changes. This market is characterized by rapid technological evolution, new product and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing customer needs and the entrance of non-traditional competitors, including products and services that enable card networks and banks to transact with consumers directly. To remain competitive, we continually pursue initiatives to develop new products and services to compete with these new market entrants. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of customer acceptance. In addition, new products and offerings may not perform as intended or generate the business or revenue growth expected. Additionally, we look for acquisition opportunities, investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will increase our market penetration and enhance our technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Any delay in the delivery of new products and services or the failure to differentiate our products and services or to accurately predict and address market demand could render our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete, to our customers and to our distribution partners. Furthermore, even though the market for integrated payment processing products and services is evolving, it may develop too rapidly or not rapidly enough for us to recover the costs we have incurred in developing new products and services targeted at this market. Any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe continued growth and development of our payment processing activities will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behavior. For example, consumer behavior may change regarding the use of payment card transactions, including the relative increased use of cash, crypto-currencies, other emerging or alternative payment methods and payment card systems that we or our processing partners do not adequately support or that do not provide adequate commissions to parties like us. Any failure to timely integrate emerging payment methods into our software, to anticipate consumer behavior changes or to contract with processing partners that support such emerging payment technologies could cause us to lose traction among our customers or referral sources, resulting in a corresponding loss of revenue, if those methods become popular among end-users of their services.\nThe products and services we deliver are designed to process complex transactions and provide reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Our technology offerings must also integrate with a variety of network, hardware, mobile and software platforms and technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to adapt to changes and innovation in these technologies. Any failure to deliver an effective, reliable and secure service or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. If we do not deliver a promised new product or service to our customers or distribution partners in a timely manner or the product or service does not perform as anticipated, our development efforts could result in increased costs and a loss in business that could reduce our earnings and cause a loss of revenue. We also rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors and potential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies, including software and hardware. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost-effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nUnauthorized disclosure, destruction or modification of data or disruption of our services could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nWe are responsible both for our own business and to a significant degree for acts and omissions by certain of our distribution partners and third-party vendors under the rules and regulations established by the payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, Discover and American Express, and the debit networks. We and other third parties collect, process, store and transmit sensitive data, such as names, addresses, social security numbers, credit or debit card numbers and expiration dates, drivers license numbers and bank account numbers, and we have ultimate liability to the payment networks and member financial institutions that register us with the payment networks for our failure, or the failure of certain distribution partners and third parties with whom we contract, to protect this data in accordance with payment network requirements. The loss, destruction or unauthorized modification of customer or cardholder data could result in significant fines, sanctions and proceedings or actions against us by the payment networks, governmental bodies, consumers or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such sanction, fine, proceeding or action could damage our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of these proceedings, disrupt our operations, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business and may result in the imposition of monetary liability.\nWe could be subject to breaches of security by hackers or other unauthorized persons. For example, on June 2, 2021, the State of Louisiana, Division of Administration (the State) and a putative class of Louisiana law enforcement districts filed a petition in the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge against i3-Software & Services, LLC (S&S), a subsidiary of the Company located in Shreveport, Louisiana, seeking monetary damages related to a third-party remote access software product used in connection with services provided by S&S to certain Louisiana Parish law enforcement districts and alleged inadequacies in the Companys cybersecurity practices. For additional information about this litigation, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAlthough we proactively employ multiple measures to defend our systems against intrusions and attacks and to protect the data we collect, our measures may not prevent unauthorized access or use of sensitive data. Recently, several municipalities have been the victims of cyberattacks, and in some cases, ransomware, through which an attacker gains access to the organizations computer files, renders them temporarily inaccessible and threatens to permanently delete them if a cash ransom is not paid by a specified deadline. While we or, to our knowledge, our distribution partners, third-party vendors or customers have not been subject to a material ransomware or cyber-extortion attack impacting us, if such an event were to occur it could significantly disrupt our operations, expose us to liability under HIPAA and/or state data breach laws, adversely impact our reputation, impact our customer relationships or subject us to material losses or liability. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats. A breach of our system or a third-party system upon which we rely may subject us to material losses or liability, including payment network fines, assessments and claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated credit, debit or card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. A misuse of such data or a cybersecurity breach could harm our reputation and deter our customers and potential customers from using electronic payments generally and our products and services specifically, thus reducing our revenue. In addition, any such misuse or breach could cause us to incur costs to correct the breaches or failures, expose us to uninsured liability, expose us to liability under HIPAA, increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny, subject us to lawsuits and result in the imposition of material penalties and fines under state and federal laws or by the payment networks. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. A significant cybersecurity breach could also result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks or the loss of our financial institution sponsorship that facilitates our participation in the payment networks, either of which could materially impede our ability to conduct business.\nAlthough we generally require that our agreements with our distribution partners and service providers who have access to customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any customer data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, there can be no assurance that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure of business or customer data, nor can we be sure that such third parties would be willing or able to satisfy liabilities arising from their breach of these agreements. Any failure by such third parties to adequately take these protective measures could result in protracted or costly litigation.\nIn addition, our agreements with our bank sponsors (as well as payment network requirements) require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of business and consumer data. Any failure to adequately comply with these protective measures could result in fees, penalties, litigation or termination of our bank sponsor agreements.\nAny significant unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data entrusted to us would cause significant damage to our reputation, impair our ability to attract new integrated technology and distribution partners and may cause parties with whom we already have such agreements to terminate them.\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa and Mastercard payment networks, those payment networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations through our bank sponsors.\nWe do not directly access the payment card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, that enable our acceptance of credit cards and debit cards, including some types of prepaid cards. Accordingly, we must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services. To provide our merchant acquiring services, we are registered through our bank sponsors with the Visa and Mastercard networks as service providers for member institutions. The majority of our $22.6 billion in payment volume in fiscal year 2022 was attributable to transactions processed on the Visa and Mastercard networks. As such, we, our bank sponsors and many of our customers are subject to complex and evolving payment network rules. The payment networks routinely update and modify requirements applicable to merchant acquirers, including rules regulating data integrity, third-party relationships (such as those with respect to bank sponsors and ISOs), merchant chargeback standards and PCI DSS. The rules of the card networks are set by their boards, which may be influenced by card issuers, some of which offer competing transaction processing services. The PCI council released version 4.0, which includes stronger standards that increase the compliance burden on processors and require additional training, education and support tools for processors to support their merchants.\nIf we or our bank sponsors fail to comply with the applicable rules and requirements of the Visa or Mastercard payment networks, Visa or Mastercard could suspend or terminate our member registration or certification, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale. Further, our transaction processing capabilities, including with respect to settlement processes, could be delayed or otherwise disrupted, and recurring non-compliance could result in the payment networks seeking to fine us. In addition, card networks and their member financial institutions regularly update, and generally expand, security expectations and requirements related to the security of cardholder data and environment. Under certain circumstances, we are required to report incidents to the card networks within a specified time frame.\nWe may also be subject to penalties from the payment card networks if we fail to detect that our customers are engaging in activities that are illegal, contrary to the payment card network operating rules, or considered high-risk. We must either prevent high-risk merchants from using our products and services or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants. Such penalties could be material and could result in termination of registration or could require changes in our process for registering new customers. This could materially and adversely affect our business.\nUnder certain circumstances specified in the payment network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of our compliance with the PCI DSS. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the PCI DSS. In addition, even if we comply with the PCI DSS, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. The termination of our registration with the payment networks, or any changes in payment network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide merchant acquiring services, could have an adverse effect on our payment processing volumes, revenues and operating costs. If we are unable to comply with the requirements applicable to our settlement activities, the payment networks may no longer allow us to provide these services, which would require us to spend additional resources to obtain settlement services from a third-party provider. In addition, if we were precluded from processing Visa and Mastercard electronic payments, we would lose substantially all of our revenues.\nWe are also subject to the operating rules of NACHA, a self-regulatory organization which administers and facilitates private-sector operating rules for ACH payments and defines the roles and responsibilities of financial institutions and other ACH network participants. The NACHA Rules and Operating Guidelines impose obligations on us and our partner financial institutions. These obligations include audit and oversight by the financial institutions and the imposition of mandatory corrective action, including termination, for serious violations. If an audit or self-assessment under PCI DSS or NACHA identifies any deficiencies that we need to remediate, the remediation efforts may distract our management team and be expensive and time consuming.\nIf our bank sponsorships are terminated and we are not able to secure or successfully migrate customer portfolios to new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct our business.\nIf the banks that sponsor us with the Visa and Mastercard networks stop sponsoring us, we would need to find other financial institutions to provide those services, which could be difficult and expensive. If we were unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship, we could no longer provide processing services to affected customers, which would negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Furthermore, some agreements with our bank sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for customers and the terms of our agreements with customers. Our bank sponsors discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the banking and financial services industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nConsolidations have been, and continue to be, active in the banking and financial services industry. It is possible that larger financial institutions that result from consolidations will have increased bargaining power when negotiating, which could result in less favorable contractual terms for us. Larger financial institutions resulting from consolidations may also decide to perform in-house some or all of the services we provide or could provide. These foregoing matters could have an adverse effect on our business, result of operations and financial condition.\nWe have faced, and may in the future face, significant chargeback liability if our customers refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers, and we may not accurately anticipate these liabilities.\nWe have potential liability for chargebacks associated with our customers processing transactions. In most circumstances, if a billing dispute between a customer and a cardholder is not ultimately resolved in favor of our customer, the disputed transaction is charged back to the customers bank and credited to the account of the cardholder. Anytime our customer is unable to satisfy a chargeback, we are responsible for that chargeback.\nIf we are unable to collect the chargeback from the customers account or reserve account (if applicable), or if the customer refuses or is financially unable due to bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholders bank. While we did not incur material chargeback losses in our 2022 or 2021 fiscal years, any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are potentially liable for losses caused by fraudulent card transactions. Card fraud occurs when a customers customer uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card number or other credentials to purchase merchandise or services. In a traditional card-present transaction, if the customer swipes the card, receives authorization for the transaction from the card issuing bank and verifies the signature on the back of the card against the paper receipt signed by the customer, the card issuing bank remains liable for any loss. In a fraudulent card-not-present transaction, even if the customer receives authorization for the transaction, the customer is liable for any loss arising from the transaction. Many of our smaller customers transact a substantial percentage of their sales over the Internet or in response to telephone or mail orders. Because their sales are card-not-present transactions, these customers are more vulnerable to customer fraud than larger customers. We may experience chargebacks arising from cardholder fraud more frequently than providers of payment processing services that service larger businesses and organizations.\nBusiness fraud occurs when a business or organization, rather than a cardholder, knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit card or card number to record a false sales transaction, or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Business fraud also occurs when employees of businesses change the business demand deposit accounts to their personal bank account numbers, so that payments are improperly credited to the employees personal account. We have established systems and procedures to detect and reduce the impact of business fraud, but there can be no assurance that these measures are or will be effective. Incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase our chargeback liability and other liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Visa rules associated with chargeback are now in effect that tighten monitoring and control of risks to combat the high rates of fraud and disputes. These new rules impact when merchants are enrolled in the Visa Fraud Monitoring Program (the VFMP) and the Visa Chargeback Monitoring Program (the VCMP). The VFMP and the VCMP target merchants with higher levels of chargebacks and fraud. Visa's new rules could have serious implications for the types of businesses that we can support, and high-risk merchants will be impacted by the changes.\nOn occasion, we experience increases in interchange and sponsorship fees; if we cannot pass these increases along to our customers, our profit margins will be reduced.\nWe pay interchange fees or assessments to issuing banks through the card associations for each transaction that is processed using their credit and debit cards. From time to time, the card associations increase the interchange fees that they charge processors and the sponsoring banks. At their sole discretion, our sponsoring banks have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us. In addition, our sponsoring banks may seek to increase their sponsorship fees charged to us, all of which are based upon the dollar amount of the payment transactions we process. If we are not able to pass these fee increases along to customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees, our profit margins will be reduced.\nThird-party hardware that we sell to our customers is generally procured from a limited number of suppliers. Thus, we are at risk of shortages, price increases, changes, delays or discontinuations of hardware, which could disrupt our business.\nMany of our solutions require or benefit from the use of third-party hardware products that we sell to our customers, such as payment terminals and point of sale equipment. A number of such products come from limited number of suppliers. Due to our reliance on the products produced by a limited number of suppliers, we are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of certain products. Additionally, various sources of supply-chain risk, including strikes or shutdowns at delivery ports or loss of or damage to our products while they are in transit or storage, intellectual property theft, losses due to tampering, issues with quality or sourcing control, failure by our suppliers to comply with applicable laws and regulation, potential tariffs or other trade restrictions, or other similar problems could limit or delay the supply of our products or harm our reputation. In the event of a shortage or supply interruption from suppliers, we may not be able to develop alternate sources quickly, cost-effectively, or at all. Any interruption or delay in manufacturing supply, any increases in costs, or the inability to obtain these products from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time, could harm our ability to provide products to our customers.\nOur systems and our third-party providers systems may fail, or our third-party providers may discontinue providing their services or technology generally or to us specifically, which in either case could interrupt our business, cause us to lose business and increase our costs.\nWe rely on third parties for specific services, software and hardware used in providing our products and services. Some of these organizations and service providers are our competitors or provide similar services and technology to our competitors, and we may not have long-term contracts with them. If these contracts are canceled or we are unable to renew them on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely impacted. The termination by our service or technology providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and, if we cannot find alternate providers quickly, may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.\nWe also rely in part on third parties for the development and access to new technologies, or for updates to existing products and services for which they provide ongoing support. Failure by these third-party providers to devote an appropriate level of attention to our products and services could result in delays in introducing new products or services, or delays in resolving any issues with existing products or services for which third-party providers provide ongoing support.\nOur systems and operations or those of our third-party technology vendors could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, acts of terrorism, human error, vandalism or sabotage, financial insolvency and similar events. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Likewise, while we have disaster recovery policies and arrangements in place, they have not been tested under actual disasters or similar events. Defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in:\nloss of revenues;\nloss of customers;\nloss of customer and cardholder data;\nfines imposed by payment networks or regulators;\nharm to our business or reputation resulting from negative publicity;\nexposure to fraud losses or other liabilities;\nadditional operating and development costs; or\ndiversion of management, technical and other resources, among other consequences.\nWe are subject to economic and political risk, the business cycles of our customers and distribution partners and changes in the overall level of consumer and commercial spending, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe electronic payment industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer and commercial spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, consumer spending, consumer discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions, particularly in the United States, continued uncertainty for an extended period of time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, persistent inflation, supply chain disruptions, or further increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or aggregate volume of transactions made using electronic payments. In general, demand for consumer products may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing. A reduction in the amount of consumer or commercial spending could result in a decrease in our revenue and profits. If our customers make fewer purchases or sales of products and services using electronic payments, or consumers spend less money through electronic payments, we will have fewer transactions to process at lower dollar amounts, resulting in lower revenue. Additionally, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. Any of these developments could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, credit card issuers may reduce credit limits and become more selective in their card issuance practices. We also have a certain amount of fixed and semi-fixed costs, including rent, debt service and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy.\nRapidly evolving domestic and global economic conditions are beyond our control and could materially adversely affect our business, operations, and results of operations.\nU.S. and international markets and, are experiencing uncertain and volatile economic conditions, including from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian aggression in Ukraine and related rises in fuel costs, sustained inflation, threats or concerns of recession, and supply chain disruptions. These conditions make it extremely difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Together, these circumstances create an environment in which it is challenging for us to predict future operating results. If these uncertain business, macroeconomic or political conditions continue or further decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA decline in the use of cards and ACH as payment mechanisms for consumers and businesses or adverse developments in the electronic payment industry in general could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf consumers and businesses do not continue to use cards or ACH as payment mechanisms for their transactions or if the mix of payments among the types of cards and ACH changes in a way that is adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Regulatory changes may also result in our customers seeking to charge their customers additional fees for use of credit or debit cards. Additionally, in recent years, increased incidents of security breaches have caused some consumers to lose confidence in the ability of businesses to protect their information, causing certain consumers to discontinue use of electronic payment methods. Security breaches could result in financial institutions canceling large numbers of credit and debit cards, or consumers or businesses electing to cancel their cards following such an incident.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions.\nOur future growth and profitability depend, in part, upon our continued expansion within the vertical markets in which we currently operate, the emergence of other vertical markets for electronic payments and our integrated solutions, and our ability to penetrate new vertical markets and our current distribution partners customer base. As part of our strategy to expand into new vertical markets, we look for acquisition opportunities and partnerships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration, technological capabilities, product offerings and distribution capabilities.\nAlthough we expect to continue to execute our acquisition strategy:\nwe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets on favorable terms;\nwe may compete with others to acquire assets, which competition may increase, and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates;\nwe may compete with others for select acquisitions and our competition may consist of larger, better-funded organizations with more resources and easier access to capital;\nwe may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates;\nwe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions; and\nwe may not be able to generate cash necessary to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our growth strategy.\nOur expansion into new vertical markets also depends upon our ability to adapt our existing technology or to develop new technologies to meet the particular needs of each new vertical market. We may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop effective and secure services or distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new vertical markets. Penetrating these new vertical markets may also prove to be more challenging or costly or take longer than we may anticipate. If we fail to expand into new vertical markets and increase our penetration into existing vertical markets, we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings.\nRevenues and profits generated via acquisition may be less than anticipated, the integration process could experience delays or difficulties, and we may fail to uncover all liabilities of acquisition targets through the due diligence process prior to an acquisition, resulting in unanticipated costs, losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges.\nIn evaluating and determining the purchase price for a prospective acquisition, we estimate the future revenues and profits from that acquisition based largely on historical financial performance. Following an acquisition, we may experience some attrition in the number of customers serviced by an acquired provider of payment processing services or included in an acquired portfolio of merchant accounts. Should the rate of post-acquisition customer attrition exceed the rate we forecasted, the revenues and profits from the acquisition may be less than we estimated, which could result in losses or a decline in profits, as well as potential impairment charges.\nWe perform a due diligence review of each of our acquisition partners. This due diligence review, however, may not adequately uncover all of the contingent or undisclosed liabilities we may incur as a consequence of the proposed acquisition, exposing us to potentially significant, unanticipated costs, as well as potential impairment charges. An acquisition may also subject us to additional regulatory burdens that affect our business in potentially unanticipated and significantly negative ways.\nThe acquisition of a provider of payment processing services, as well as a portfolio of merchant accounts, requires the transfer of various data processing functions and connecting links to our systems and those of our third-party service providers. If the transfer of these functions and links does not occur rapidly and smoothly, payment processing delays and errors may occur, resulting in a loss of revenues, increased customer attrition and increased expenditures to correct the transitional problems, which could preclude our attainment of, or reduce, our anticipated revenue and profits. Additionally, any integrations that do not occur rapidly and smoothly could divert the attention of management away from other strategic matters, including, but not limited to, acquisitions or product development.\nIn connection with some acquisitions, we may incur non-recurring severance expenses, restructuring charges or change of control payments. These expenses, charges or payments, as well as the initial costs of integrating the personnel and facilities of an acquired business with those of our existing operations, may adversely affect our operating results during the initial financial periods following an acquisition. In addition, the integration of newly acquired companies may lead to diversion of management attention from other ongoing business concerns.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our intellectual property.\nOur intellectual property is critical to our future success, particularly in our strategic verticals where we may offer proprietary software solutions to our customers. We rely on a combination of contractual license rights and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary technology. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our third-party licensors, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain service offerings or other competitive harm. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products and services, design around or reverse engineer our intellectual property, and in such cases neither we nor our third-party licensors may be able to assert intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual license arrangements may be subject to termination or renegotiation with unfavorable terms to us, and our third-party licensors may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other adverse business dynamics, any of which might affect our ability to use and exploit the products licensed to us by these third-party licensors. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights (including litigation against our third-party licensors), which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain third-party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims.\nWe may be subject to costly litigation if our products or services are alleged to infringe upon or otherwise violate a third partys proprietary rights. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our products and services. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our products and services. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for patent infringement, breach of copyright, trademark, license usage or other intellectual property rights. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products or services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards for which we may not have insurance, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstances, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nSome of our solutions contain \"open-source\" software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of applicable open-source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nWe use certain software licensed under open-source licenses and may continue to use such software in the future. Some open-source licenses require us to make available source code for modifications or derivative works that we create based upon the open-source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works pursuant to a particular open source license or other license allowing further use by third parties. Some open-source licenses could require us to release the source code of our proprietary software if we combine our proprietary software with the open-source software subject to that license. Additionally, the terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by United States or other courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. Using open-source software can also be riskier than using software subject to a more restrictive license because open-source licenses generally do not contain such protections as warranties. Many of the risks associated with using open-source software cannot be eliminated and using such software could adversely affect us.\nIf we lose key personnel, or if their reputations are damaged, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected, and proprietary information of our company could be shared with our competitors.\nWe depend on the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel, particularly Messrs. Daily, Whitson and Stanford, who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the vertical markets in which we offer our products and services. Many of our key personnel have worked for us for a significant amount of time or were recruited by us specifically due to their experience. Our success depends in part upon the reputation and influence within the industry of our senior managers who have, over the years, developed long standing and favorable relationships with our vendors, card associations, bank sponsors and other payment processing and service providers. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, contractual obligations related to confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property rights may be ineffective or unenforceable, and departing employees may share our proprietary information with competitors in ways that could adversely impact us.\nIn a dynamic industry like ours, our success and growth depend on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and develop qualified employees.\nOur business functions at the intersection of rapidly changing technological, social, economic and regulatory developments that require a wide-ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. For us to continue to successfully compete and grow, we must attract, recruit, develop and retain the necessary personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the entire spectrum of our intellectual capital needs. While we have a number of key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, we must also develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital. The market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart with qualified or effective successors. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. We can make no assurances that qualified employees will continue to be employed or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results and operating metrics are subject to seasonality and volatility, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and operating results or in perceptions of our business prospects.\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically our revenues have been strongest in our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters and weakest in our second fiscal quarter. This is due to the increase in the number and amount of electronic payment transactions related to seasonal retail events, such as holiday and vacation spending. The number of business days in a month or quarter also may affect seasonal fluctuations. We also experience volatility in certain other metrics, such as customers, transactions and dollar volume. Volatility in our key operating metrics or their rates of growth could have a negative impact on our financial results and investor perceptions of our business prospects. Furthermore, we are not able to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business.\nWe are a decentralized company, which presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business unit than we would in a more centralized environment, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a decentralized company. While we believe this structure has catalyzed our growth and enabled us to remain responsive to opportunities and to our customers needs, it necessarily places significant control and decision-making powers in the hands of local management. This presents various risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a key business unit than we would in a more centralized environment. In addition, it means that we may be slower to detect compliance related problems and that company-wide business initiatives, such as the integration of disparate information technology systems, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the problem or initiative in question, such failure could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of various claims and legal proceedings and may become the subject of claims, litigation or investigations, including commercial disputes and employee claims, such as claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, immigration violations or other local, state and federal labor law violations, and from time to time may be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Any claims asserted against us or our management, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, could harm our reputation or the reputation of our management and have an adverse impact on our relationship with our customers, distribution partners and other third parties and could lead to additional related claims. In light of the potential cost and uncertainty involved in litigation, we have in the past and may in the future settle matters even when we believe we have a meritorious defense. Certain claims may seek injunctive relief, which could disrupt the ordinary conduct of our business and operations or increase our cost of doing business. Our insurance or indemnities may not fully cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. Any judgments or settlements in any pending litigation or future claims, litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rates that result in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar increases the real cost of our products to our end-customers outside of the United States and may lead to reduced demand for our services. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, this could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Our operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies are increasing and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe employ resources outside of the United States to support on onshore operations. Countries outside of the United States may be subject to relatively higher degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. The occurrence of natural disasters, pandemics, such as COVID-19, or political or economic instability in these countries could interfere with work performed by these labor sources or could result in our having to replace or reduce these labor sources. If countries in which we operate experience civil or political unrest or acts of terrorism, our operations in such countries could be materially impaired. Our vendors in other countries could potentially shut down suddenly for any reason, including financial problems or personnel issues. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nWe are subject to extensive laws and government regulation, the costs of compliance with which can be significant, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations may subject us to penalties and otherwise have an unfavorable impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous federal and state regulations that affect the electronic payments industry. Regulation of our industry has increased significantly in recent years and is constantly evolving. We are also subject to other laws and regulations, including those addressing U.S. financial services, consumer protection, escheat and privacy and information security, among other subjects. Changes to statutes, regulations or industry standards, including interpretation and implementation of statutes, regulations or standards, could increase our cost of doing business or affect the competitive balance. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, including the limitation, suspension or termination of services provided to, or by, third parties, and the imposition of other penalties or fines. To the extent these laws and regulations negatively impact the business, operations or financial condition of our customers, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected because, among other matters, our customers could have less capacity to purchase products and services from us, could decide to avoid or abandon certain lines of business, or could seek to pass on increased costs to us by negotiating price reductions. In addition, we could be required to invest a significant amount of time and resources in response to new or changes to existing laws, regulations or oversight, or to modify the manner in which we contract with or provide products and services to our customers; and those laws and regulations could directly or indirectly limit how much we can charge for our services. We may not be able to update our existing products and services, or develop new ones, to satisfy our customers needs. Any of these events, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious laws and regulations, including those in other industries in which we provide services, even if such laws and regulations not directed at us, may require us to make significant efforts to change our products and services and may require that we incur additional compliance costs and change how we price our products and services to our customers and distribution partners. Implementing new compliance efforts is difficult because of the complexity of regulatory requirements, and we are devoting and will continue to devote significant resources to ensure compliance. Furthermore, regulatory actions may cause changes in business practices by us and other industry participants which could affect how we market, price and distribute our products and services, and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation.\nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal and state regulations may increase our compliance costs, limit our revenues and otherwise negatively affect our business.\nSince the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there have been substantial reforms to the supervision and operation of the financial services industry, including numerous new regulations that have imposed compliance costs and, in some cases, limited revenue sources for us and our financial institution partners and customers. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which is empowered to conduct rule-making and supervision related to, and enforcement of, federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has issued guidance that applies to supervised service providers, which the CFPB has defined to include service providers, like us, to CFPB supervised banks and nonbanks. In addition, federal and state agencies have recently proposed or enacted cybersecurity regulations, such as the Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies issued by the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Enhanced Cyber Risk Management Standards issued by The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in October 2016. Such cybersecurity regulations are applicable to large bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, as well as to service providers to those organizations. Any new rules and regulations implemented by the CFPB, state or other authorities or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act could, among other things, slow our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing industry, require us to make significant additional investments to comply with them, redirect time and resources to compliance obligations, modify our products or services or the manner in which they are provided, or limit or change the amount or types of revenue we are able to generate.\nInterchange fees, which the payment processor typically pays to the card issuer in connection with credit and debit card transactions, are subject to increasingly intense legal, regulatory and legislative scrutiny. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act regulates and limits debit card fees charged by certain card issuers and allows businesses and organizations to set minimum dollar amounts for the acceptance of credit cards. Specifically, under the so-called Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the interchange fees that certain issuers charge businesses and organizations for debit transactions are regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transactions. Rules released by the Federal Reserve in July 2011 to implement the Durbin Amendment mandate a cap on debit transaction interchange fees for card issuers with assets of $10 billion or greater. Since October 2011, a payment network may not prohibit a card issuer from contracting with any other payment network for the processing of electronic debit transactions involving the card issuers debit cards, and card issuers and payment networks may not inhibit the ability of businesses and organizations to direct the routing of debit card transactions over any payment networks that can process the transactions.\nRules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act also contain certain prohibitions on payment network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions. These restrictions could negatively affect the number of debit transactions processed, and prices charged per transaction, which would negatively affect our business.\nIf we violate the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA), it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our customers in our Education vertical and could harm our reputation. Further, if we disclose student information in violation of FERPA or PPRA, our access to student information could be suspended.\nOur systems and solutions must also comply, in certain circumstances, with FERPA and PPRA, as well as with rapidly emerging state student data privacy laws that require schools to protect student data and to adopt privacy policies which can significantly vary from one state to another. FERPA generally prohibits an educational institution from disclosing personally identifiable information from a students education records without a parents consent unless certain statutory exceptions apply. Our school customers and their students disclose to us, and we may store, certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. PPRA puts limits on survey, analysis or evaluations that may come into play when schools employ internet-based educational services. Schools are required to develop policies that address, among other things, the collection, disclosure or use of personal information collected from students for the purpose of marketing or selling that information, and can place restrictions on third parties use of that data. As an entity that provides services to educational institutions, we are indirectly subject to FERPAs and PPRAs privacy requirements, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose or use any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than on a basis and in a manner permitted under the statutes. If we violate FERPA or PPRA, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our customers and could reduce our revenues or harm our reputation. Further, if we disclose student information in violation of FERPA or PPRA, our access to student information could be suspended, thus inhibiting our business operations.\nActual or perceived failures to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and regulations could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our customers in our Healthcare vertical, harm our reputation and subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties under laws such as HIPAA and state privacy and security laws.\nThe data protection landscape is rapidly evolving, and we are or may become subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, disclosure, retention, and security of health-related and other personal information. The cost of compliance with the laws and regulations is high and is likely to increase in the future. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable data privacy and security laws or regulations, our internal policies and procedures or our contracts governing our processing of personal information could result in negative publicity, government investigations and enforcement actions, claims by third parties and damage to our reputation, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business.\nFor example, the HIPAA privacy and security regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of protected health information and require business associates such as our company to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. If we are unable to properly protect\nthe privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers and be subject to investigation by the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In the event OCR finds that we have failed to comply with applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. OCR has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. OCR has the discretion to impose penalties without being required to attempt to resolve violations through informal means. Further, OCR may require companies to enter into resolution agreements and corrective action plans which impose ongoing compliance requirements. OCR enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions under either HIPAA or similar state laws, seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Although we have implemented and maintain policies, processes and a compliance program infrastructure to assist us in complying with these laws and regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our Healthcare vertical operations. Further, the FTC has prosecuted certain data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act.\nIf we violate the federal AKS, the CMP Law, the federal FCA, the Cures Act or similar federal or state laws and regulations, it could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our customers in our Healthcare vertical, harm our reputation and subject us to substantial civil and criminal penalties.\nWe strive to comply with healthcare laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to us directly and to our customers and contractors, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by enforcement initiatives. We have been, and in the future may become, involved in governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory and other authorities or private whistleblowers could be expensive and time-consuming, could result in loss of business, exposure to adverse publicity and injury to our reputation and could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customers.\nHealthcare laws, regulations and other requirements impacting our Healthcare vertical operations include the following:\nAnti-Kickback Laws. A number of federal and state laws govern patient referrals, financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and inducements to providers and patients, including restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the AKS. The AKS contains a limited number of exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of HHS has created regulatory safe harbors to the AKS. Activities that comply with a safe harbor are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS. Certain of our contracts and other arrangements may not meet an exception or a safe harbor. Failure to qualify for safe harbor protection does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the AKS, but it may subject the arrangement to greater government scrutiny. We cannot provide assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the AKS. Allegations of violations of the AKS may be brought under the civil CMP Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than the AKS.\nThe HHS OIG has a longstanding concern that percentage-based billing arrangements may increase the risk of improper billing practices. The HHS OIG recommends that medical billing companies develop and implement comprehensive compliance programs to mitigate this risk. In addition, certain states have adopted laws or regulations forbidding splitting of fees with non-physicians, which may be interpreted to prevent business service providers, including medical billing providers, from using a percentage-based billing arrangement. While we have developed and implemented a comprehensive billing compliance program that we believe is consistent with the federal guidance, our failure to ensure compliance with controlling legal requirements, accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business and contracting model, or other failure to comply with regulatory requirements, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity and negatively affect our business.\nViolation of the AKS is a felony, and penalties may include imprisonment, criminal fines and substantial civil monetary penalties. In addition, submission of a claim for items or services generated in violation of the AKS may be subject to additional penalties under the federal FCA as a false or fraudulent claim.\nFalse or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding. Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations and sub-regulatory guidance. Our Healthcare vertical may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the federal FCA, the CMP Law and state equivalents. For example, errors or the unintended consequences of data manipulations by us or our systems with respect to the entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claims, coding, audit, eligibility and other information, may result in allegations of false or fraudulent claims.\nFalse or fraudulent claims under the FCA and other laws include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, making or causing to be made or used a false record or statement that is material to a false claim, failing to report and refund known overpayments within 60 days of identifying the overpayment, misrepresenting actual services rendered, improper coding and billing for medically unnecessary items or services. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim. In addition, the FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, \"knowingly\" submitting a false claim may result in liability. When an entity is determined to have violated the FCA, the government may impose substantial civil fines and penalties for each false claim, plus treble damages, and exclude the entity from participation in federal healthcare programs. Private parties are able to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, lawsuits on behalf of the government in connection with alleged false claims submitted to the government, and these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government. Several states, including states in which we operate, have adopted their own false claims provisions and their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private individual may file a civil lawsuit in state court.\nSome fraud and abuse laws, such as the CMP Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud, waste and abuse laws. Federal and state authorities increasingly assert liability under the CMP Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the various criminal healthcare fraud provisions. Current penalties under the CMP Law are significant and may result in penalties of up to three times the amount claimed or received. Civil monetary penalties, including those imposed under the AKS, FCA, and CMP Law are updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.\nAlthough we believe our processes are consistent with applicable reimbursement rules and industry practice, a court, government authority or whistleblower could challenge these processes. In addition, we cannot guarantee that federal and state authorities will regard any billing and coding errors we process or make as inadvertent or will not hold us responsible for any compliance issues related to claims, reports and other information we handle on behalf of our customers. We cannot predict the impact of any enforcement actions under the various false claims and fraud, waste and abuse laws applicable to our operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our practices could cause us to incur adverse publicity and significant legal and related costs.\nThe laws and regulations in this area are both broad and vague and judicial interpretation can be inconsistent. We review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to comply with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements. However, we are unable to predict how laws and regulations will be interpreted or the full extent of their application, particularly to services that are not directly billed to or reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, such as transaction processing services. Any determination by a federal or state regulatory authority that any of our activities or those of our customers or vendors violate any of these laws or regulations could: (i) subject us to civil or criminal penalties, (ii) require us to enter into corporate integrity agreements or similar agreements with government regulators to meet ongoing compliance obligations, (iii) require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, (iv) require us to refund a portion of our service fees, and/or (v) disqualify us from providing services to customers that are, or do business with, government programs. Any of these could result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response.\nThe Cures Act and Implementing Regulations (Information Blocking and HIT Standards and Certification Requirements). Standards regarding electronic exchange of information and interoperability are subject to regular revision and updates, and we are required to modify and enhance products and services accordingly. The Information Blocking Final Rule prohibits healthcare providers, HIEs, and HIT developers, including our subsidiary that provides electronic medical records, from information blocking, which is defined as practices likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI, except as\nrequired by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Civil monetary penalties for information blocking by HIT developers are substantial, up to $1 million per violation. The HIT Standards and Certification Criteria Final Rule imposes new criteria related to EHI export and standardized APIs for patient services, and HIT developers of certified HIT need to ensure that their products and services meet the requisite technical standards by the relevant deadlines and continue to evolve as developers and other stakeholders release revised versions of these standards. Additionally, HIT developers that participate in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, like i3, must make various certifications regarding their HIT and attest to compliance with applicable conditions of certification, including those related to information blocking.\nThese new rules are currently applicable to certain services we offer, and customers may insist that we develop additional solutions that comply with these various interoperability requirements, which could subject us to additional costs. We currently are and likely will continue to have certain solutions certified by ONC, which could further increase development costs and delay customer sales and implementations. We also may incur costs in periods prior to the corresponding recognition of revenue. To the extent current regulations are subsequently changed or supplemented, customers may postpone or cancel their decisions to purchase or implement such solutions.\nExclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. The OIG may or must exclude individuals and entities involved in misconduct related to federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, from participation in those programs. Federal law prohibits federal healthcare programs from paying for items or services furnished, ordered, or prescribed by an individual or entity excluded from participation. The prohibition against federal program payment extends to payment for administrative and management services not directly related to patient care. Civil penalties may be imposed against providers and entities that employ or enter into contracts with excluded individuals to provide items or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries. We have implemented compliance policies and procedures to screen for excluded individuals. However, if we are found to have employed or contracted with an excluded individual or entity, we could face significant consequences such as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, civil monetary penalties, and treble damages. In addition, we could be liable under our customer contracts, if we are excluded by the OIG or employ or contract with an excluded individual or entity.\nRecent and future developments in the healthcare industry, particularly those related to HIT, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA material portion of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences.\nThere are numerous federal, state and private initiatives seeking to increase the use of HIT as a means of improving care and reducing costs. For example, the HITECH Act and the Cures Act promote the use of EHR technology, interoperability and the efficient exchange of EHI. These statutes are implemented mainly through HIPAA, CMSs Promoting Interoperability Program, and ONCs Information Blocking Final Rule and HIT Standards and Certification Criteria Final Rule. The Information Blocking Final Rule, for example, prohibits health care providers, HIEs, and HIT developers from information blocking, which is defined as practices likely to interfere with, prevent, or materially discourage access, exchange, or use of EHI, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. The Company is subject to this rule as an HIT developer. Civil monetary penalties for information blocking by HIT developers are substantial, up to $1 million per violation. The HIT Standards and Certification Criteria Final Rule imposes criteria related to EHI export and standardized APIs for patient services, and HIT developers of certified HIT need to ensure that their products and services meet the requisite technical standards by the relevant deadlines and continue to evolve as developers and other stakeholders release revised versions of these standards. Additionally, HIT developers that participate in the ONC Health IT Certification Program, like i3, must make various certifications regarding their HIT and attest to compliance with applicable conditions of certification, including those related to information blocking.\nThese and other initiatives may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements, the cost of compliance with which may be significant; encourage more companies to enter our markets, provide advantages to our competitors; and/or result in the development of competitive technology solutions. Any such initiatives also may\nresult in a reduction of expenditures by existing or potential customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, other general reductions in expenditures by healthcare industry constituents could result from, among other things, government regulation or private initiatives that affect the manner in which providers interact with patients, payers or other healthcare industry constituents, including changes in pricing or means of delivery of healthcare solutions. In addition, cost containment efforts at the federal and state levels may affect industry expenditures. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on payments of Medicare claims in 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2030. In addition, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 increased the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggered an additional statutorily mandated sequestration. As a result, an additional payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2023.\nEven if general expenditures by healthcare industry constituents remain the same or increase, other developments in the healthcare industry may reduce spending on healthcare IT and services or in some or all of the specific markets we serve or are planning to serve. In addition, our customers expectations regarding pending or potential healthcare industry developments also may affect their budgeting processes and spending plans with respect to the types of solutions we provide. For example, use of our solutions could be affected by:\nchanges in the billing patterns of providers;\nchanges in the design of health insurance plans; and\nchanges in the contracting methods payers use in their relationships with providers.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly in recent years, and we expect that significant changes will continue to occur. The timing and impact of developments in the healthcare industry are difficult to predict. We cannot be sure that the markets for our solutions will continue to exist at their current levels or will not change in ways that adversely affect us, or that we will have adequate technical, financial and marketing resources to react to changes in those markets.\nWe may be a party to regulatory and other proceedings that could result in unexpected adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we have been, are and may in the future be, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings, including investigations, audits, and other reviews. There are an increasing number of investigations and proceedings in the healthcare industry that seek recovery under HIPAA, AKS, the FCA, the CMP, state laws and other statutes and regulations applicable to our business as described in more detail above. Such proceedings can result in verdicts, injunctive relief or other sanctions that may affect how we operate our business and/or have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Violations of applicable statutes and regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties, including exclusion from government healthcare programs, and settlements of lawsuits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require monetary penalties and corporate integrity agreements. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in managements evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Litigation is costly, time-consuming and disruptive to normal business operations. In addition, the defense of these matters could result in continued diversion of our managements time and attention away from business operations, which could also harm our business. Even if these matters are resolved in our favor, the uncertainty and expense associated with unresolved legal proceedings could harm our business and reputation.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe and many of our customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. In addition, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP), the Telemarketing Sales Act and other laws, rules and or regulations, may directly impact the activities of certain of our customers, and in some cases may subject us, as the electronic payment processor or provider of certain services, to investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds if we were deemed to have improperly aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal or improper activities of the customer through our services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general have authority to take action against non-banks that engage in UDAAP, or violate other laws, rules and regulations. To the extent we are processing payments or providing products and services for a customer that may be in violation of laws, rules and regulations, we may be subject to enforcement actions and as a result may incur losses and liabilities that may adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provide services or have employees.\nBecause of our international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provide services or have employees. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties and could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nNumerous other federal laws affect our business, and any failure to comply with those laws could harm our business.\nOur payment facilitator solutions present certain regulatory challenges, principally those relating to money transmitter issues. To address these challenges we, along with our third-party service providers, use structural arrangements designed to prevent us from receiving or controlling our customers funds and therefore remove our activities from the scope of money transmitter regulation. There can be no assurance that these structural arrangements will remain effective as money transmitter laws continue to evolve or that the applicable regulatory bodies, particularly state agencies, will view our payment facilitator activities as compliant.\nOur business may also be subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA), which regulates the use and reporting of consumer credit information and imposes disclosure requirements on entities that take adverse action based on information obtained from credit reporting agencies. We could be liable if our practices under the FCRA do not comply with the FCRA or regulations under it.\nThe Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 included an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), that requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by payment processing entities and third-party settlement organizations with respect to payments made in settlement of electronic payment transactions and third-party payment network transactions occurring in that calendar year. Reportable transactions are also subject to backup withholding requirements. We could be liable for penalties if our information returns are not in compliance with these regulations.\nDepending on how our products and services evolve, we may be subject to a variety of additional laws and regulations, including those governing money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, restrictions on foreign assets, gambling, banking and lending, U.S. Safe Harbor regulations, and import and export restrictions. Additionally, we are contractually required to comply with certain anti-money laundering regulations in connection with our payment processing activities. These regulations are generally governed by FinCEN and OFAC. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. Regulators continue to increase their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations, which may require us to further revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of our customers, and to monitor transactions. If we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our customers, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations could increase our tax burden and decrease the amount of revenues we receive, the value of any tax loss carryforwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet and the amount of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority which could increase our tax liabilities. Furthermore, companies in the payment processing industry, including us, may become subject to incremental taxation in various tax jurisdictions. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on this topic. If we are required to pay additional taxes and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our customers, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanging laws and governmental rules and regulations designed to protect or limit access to or use of personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services, and actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal and regulatory obligations may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to those laws and regulations discussed previously that are imposed by the card networks and NACHA, governmental bodies in the United States have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the use, collection, storage, transfer and disposal of, and requiring safeguarding of, personal information. Our operations are subject to certain provisions of these laws. Relevant federal privacy laws include, in addition to FERPA and PPRA described above, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. The U.S. Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act also regulates the collection of information by operators of websites and other electronic solutions that are directed to children under 13 years of age. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. They also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. In addition, there are state laws and regulations restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and drivers license numbers. Certain states impose similar privacy obligations as well as obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies that own data.\nIn connection with providing products and services to our customers, we are required by regulations, government-required standards, and by our contracts with customers and with our financial institution distribution partners to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These contracts may require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with applicable standards. The compliance standards relate to the security of our infrastructure, and include components and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of individuals non-public personal information that our customers share with us. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract, grow and maintain business in the future. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to data privacy and information security, we could be exposed to legal claims and actions or to regulatory enforcement proceedings. In addition, our relationships and reputation could be harmed, which could inhibit our ability to retain existing customers and distribution partners and obtain new customers and distribution partners.\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies (regardless of their location) that collect personal information of California residents to notify consumers about their data collection, use, and sharing practices. The CCPA also grants consumers specific rights to access and to delete their data and to opt out of certain data sharing with or sales to third parties. The California Attorney General is currently responsible for the enforcement of the CCPA and issued Final Regulations governing CCPA compliance on August 14, 2020. The California Attorney General can impose statutory fines for violations and consumers have a limited private right of action for unauthorized access to certain categories of information. Notably, it may be possible to have statutory damages imposed without proof of actual damages from the unauthorized access. On November 3, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 24, enacting the CPRA, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, but applies to certain personal information collected on or after January 1, 2022. CPRA amends and expands the CCPA to create additional consumer privacy rights, such as the right of correction and the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information. The CPRA also establishes a new privacy enforcement agency, the CPPA, which will assume responsibility for promulgating, revising, and implementing regulations interpreting the CCPA and CPRA by either July 1, 2021, or six months after the CPPA indicates it is ready to begin rulemaking (whichever is later). Unlike the CCPA, the CPRA cannot be repealed by the California legislature, but can be amended by a simple majority provided such amendments are consistent with and further the purpose and intent of the law.\nIn addition, several other states have introduced or passed similar legislation to the CCPA, including Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Maine, that may impose varying standards and requirements on our data collection, use and processing activities. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data.\nGovernment regulators, industry groups and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. Regulators and courts may expand interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business. If more restrictive privacy laws or rules and/or inconsistent legal requirements are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level, or regulators' enforcement priorities shift, our compliance costs may increase and our ability to perform due diligence on, and monitor the risk of, our current and potential customers may decrease, which could create liability for us. Additionally, if we suffer a data breach, other privacy or cybersecurity regulatory compliance failures or are subject to fines, sanctions or proceedings as a result of actual or perceived compliance failures, or any similar event causing reputational harm, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed, and our potential liability for security breaches may increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Any failure of our products or services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal liability and could, among other things, adversely affect demand for our services, invalidate all or portions of some of our contracts with our customers and financial institution partners, or require us to change or terminate some portions of our business. Further, reform efforts or changing healthcare regulatory requirements may also render our products or services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new products or services. This may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop or modify our products and services. Such healthcare reforms may also make introduction of new products and service costlier or more time-consuming than we currently anticipate. These changes may also prevent our introduction of new products and services or make the continuation or maintenance of our existing products and services unprofitable or impossible.\nWe will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company on September 30, 2023, and as a result, we will have to comply with increased disclosure and compliance requirements.\nWe are currently an emerging growth company (\"EGC\") as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \"JOBS Act\"). However, September 30, 2023 will be last day of the fiscal year in which the five-year anniversary of our IPO occurs, and at that point we will no longer qualify as an EGC. As such, we will be subject to certain disclosure and compliance requirements that apply to other public companies but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\nthe requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, including critical audit matters;\nthe requirement that we provide full and more detailed disclosures regarding executive compensation; and\nthe requirement that we hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect that the loss of EGC status and compliance will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and cause management and other personnel to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to public company reporting requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and competitive position.\nOn May 9, 2019, we replaced our existing senior secured credit facility with a new 2019 senior secured credit facility (the Senior Secured Credit Facility). The Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended in October 2022, consists of a $375 million revolving credit facility, together with an option to increase the revolving credit facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an additional principal amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate (subject to the receipt of additional commitments for any such incremental loan amounts). The Senior Secured Credit Facility accrues interest at Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") (based upon an interest period of one, three or six months), plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus an applicable margin of up to 3.25%, or the base rate (defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) Term SOFR, plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.25% (1.25% as of September 30, 2022), in each case depending upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to pay unused commitment fees of 0.15% to 0.30% (0.30% as of September 30, 2022) on any undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees of up to 3.25% on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit issued under the agreement. As of September 30, 2022, we had borrowings outstanding of $185.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. Although we may enter into interest rate swap agreements in the future, we and our subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate increases on the floating portion of our Senior Secured Credit Facility that are not covered by interest rate swaps, to the extent we have indebtedness outstanding. For additional information about our Senior Secured Credit Facility, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn February 18, 2020, i3 Verticals, LLC issued $138.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Exchangeable Notes. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.0% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020. Prior to August 15, 2024, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods described in the Indenture, and thereafter, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable on the terms set forth in the Indenture into cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at i3 Verticals, LLCs election. As of September 30, 2022, $117.0 million of the original aggregate principal amount of $138.0 million was outstanding.\nTo service our debt and any additional debt we may incur in the future, we need to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash is subject, to a certain extent, to our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, including acquisition activity, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. Although we currently expect that our cash flow from operations, current cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned expenditures and to service our debt obligations for at least the next twelve months, there can be no assurance that our business will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings or other financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt and fund our other liquidity needs. To the extent we are required to use our cash flow from operations or the proceeds of any future financing to service our debt instead of funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition activity or other general corporate purposes, we will be less able to plan for, or react to, changes in our business, industry and in the economy generally. This will place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that the terms of that debt will allow any of the above alternative measures or that these measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the value of our outstanding debt. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains, and any agreements evidencing or governing other future debt may contain, certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to engage in certain activities that are in our long-term best interests, including our ability to:\nincur liens on property, assets or revenues;\nincur or assume additional debt or amend our debt and other material agreements;\ndeclare or make distributions and redeem or repurchase equity interests or issue preferred stock;\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\nmake investments;\nenter into any sale-and-leaseback of property;\nengage in certain business activities; and\nengage in mergers and asset sales.\nThe restrictive covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facility also require us to maintain specified financial ratios. While we have not previously breached and are not in breach of any of these covenants, there can be no guarantee that we will not breach these covenants in the future. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events and factors beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. An event of default would permit the lending banks under the facility to take certain actions, including terminating all outstanding commitments and declaring all amounts outstanding under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable, including all outstanding borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable with respect to such borrowings and any terminated commitments. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them, which includes substantially all of our assets.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances, and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities or refinance existing debt for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all. As discussed above, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt and engage in other capital-raising activities. Any debt financing we obtain in the future could involve covenants that further restrict our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to operate our business, obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our then-existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle exchanges of the Exchangeable Notes or to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of our Exchangeable Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Exchangeable Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of Class A common stock to settle an exchange of the Exchangeable Notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of Exchangeable Notes surrendered therefor or Exchangeable Notes being exchanged. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or to pay cash upon exchanges of the Exchangeable Notes is limited by the agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including the Senior Secured Credit Facility) and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Exchangeable Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture that governs the Exchangeable Notes or to pay cash\npayable on future exchanges of the Exchangeable Notes if and/or as required by the Indenture would constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness (including the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility) and agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Exchangeable Notes or make cash payments upon exchanges thereof.\nThe conditional exchange feature of the Exchangeable Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional exchange feature of the Exchangeable Notes is triggered, holders of Exchangeable Notes will be entitled to exchange the Exchangeable Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to exchange their Exchangeable Notes, we may elect to settle all or a portion of our exchange obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to exchange their Exchangeable Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Our Company\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own, and our principal asset is our controlling membership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. Accordingly, we depend on distributions from i3 Verticals, LLC to pay our taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own and currently have no significant assets other than our ownership of common units of i3 Verticals, LLC. We currently have no independent means of generating revenue. Consequently, our ability to obtain operating funds depends upon distributions from i3 Verticals, LLC. Furthermore, i3 Verticals, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its net taxable income is generally allocated to its members, including us, pro rata according to the number of membership interests each member owns. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of i3 Verticals, LLC in addition to expenses related to our operations, and our ability to obtain funds to pay these income taxes currently depends upon distributions from i3 Verticals, LLC. We intend to cause i3 Verticals, LLC to distribute cash to us in an amount at least equal to the amount necessary to cover our respective tax liabilities, if any, with respect to our allocable share of the net income of i3 Verticals, LLC and to cover dividends, if any, we declare, as well as any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement (the Tax Receivable Agreement or \"TRA\") by and among i3 Verticals, Inc., i3 Verticals, LLC and each of the holders, other than i3 Verticals, Inc., of common units in i3 Verticals, LLC (the Continuing Equity Owners). See the detailed discussion under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Secured Credit Facility in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the restrictive covenants, including i3 Verticals, LLCs obligations to maintain specific financial ratios, that may limit its ability to make certain distributions to us.\nTo the extent that we need funds to pay our taxes or other liabilities or to fund our operations, and i3 Verticals, LLC is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements under which it is bound, including its financing agreements, laws or regulations, does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nThe interests of the other Continuing Equity Owners in our business may conflict with the interests of holders of shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe Continuing Equity Owners, who collectively hold approximately 31% of the combined voting power of our common stock as of November 17, 2022, may receive payments from us under the Tax Receivable Agreement upon a redemption or exchange of their common units in i3 Verticals, LLC, including the issuance of shares of our Class A common stock upon any such redemption or exchange. As a result, the interests of the Continuing Equity Owners may conflict with the interests of holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, the Continuing Equity Owners may have different tax positions from us which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of the Continuing Equity Owners even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nWe may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from future redemptions or exchanges of common units by holders.\nOur organizational structure, including the Tax Receivable Agreement, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Equity Owners that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit the Continuing Equity Owners. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are entitled to retain (a) 15% of the U.S. federal and state income tax savings we realize as a result of increases in tax basis created by any future redemptions or exchanges of common units held by our equity holders that are parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement for shares of our Class A common stock or cash for the tax years following a redemption or exchange covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (b) all of the U.S. federal and state income tax savings we realize from such redemptions or exchanges for tax periods ending after those covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement. Our ability to realize, and benefit from, these tax savings depends on several assumptions, including that we will earn sufficient taxable income each year during the period over which the deductions arising from any such basis increases and payments are available and that there are no adverse changes in applicable law or regulations. If our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits, and our cash flows and stockholders equity could be negatively affected.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Continuing Equity Owners may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations, or our successors obligations, under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments thereunder would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully use all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs a result of the foregoing, (a) we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (b) if we elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIn certain circumstances, i3 Verticals, LLC will be required to make distributions to us and the Continuing Equity Owners, and the distributions that i3 Verticals, LLC will be required to make may be substantial.\nFunds used by i3 Verticals, LLC to satisfy its tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business. Moreover, the tax distributions that i3 Verticals, LLC will be required to make may be substantial, and will likely exceed (as a percentage of i3 Verticals, LLCs net income) the overall effective tax rate applicable to a similarly situated corporate taxpayer.\nAs a result of potential differences in the amount of net taxable income allocable to us and to the Continuing Equity Owners, as well as the use of an assumed tax rate in calculating i3 Verticals, LLCs distribution obligations, we may receive distributions significantly in excess of our tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent, as currently expected, we do not distribute such cash balances as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to i3 Verticals, LLC, the Continuing Equity Owners would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances as a result of their ownership of Class A common stock following a redemption or exchange of their common units.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a significant and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nSince the completion of our IPO, we have been subject to a requirement, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), to conduct an annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and furnish a report by management on, among other things, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each fiscal year beginning with the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC. However, because we are an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the earlier of the fifth year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. Ensuring that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that must be evaluated frequently. Establishing and maintaining these internal controls is and will continue to be costly and may divert managements attention.\nWhen evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude, on an ongoing basis, that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and any remediation actions or the impact of the same on our operations. If we have not adequately implemented or complied with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, or suffer other adverse regulatory consequences, including penalties for violation of Nasdaq rules. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. A loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could occur if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we may be required to incur costs in improving our internal control system, including the costs of the hiring of additional personnel. Any such action could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could also lead to a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\nprohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; and\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain business combinations with any interested stockholder for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\nprior to such time, our board of directors (Board of Directors) approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\nupon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the votes of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\nat or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our Board of Directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the votes of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an interested stockholder is a person who, together with that persons affiliates and associates, owns, or within the previous three years owned, 15% or more of the votes of our outstanding voting stock. For purposes of this provision, voting stock means any class or series of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who would be an interested stockholder to effect various business combinations with our company for a three-year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring our company to negotiate in advance with our Board of Directors because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if our Board of Directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our Board of Directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to nominate directors for election to our Board of Directors and take other corporate actions.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock can be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe Continuing Equity Owners own common units in i3 Verticals, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners have the right to redeem their common units in i3 Verticals, LLC pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of i3 Verticals, LLC (the \"LLC Agreement\") for shares of Class A common stock or cash.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have an aggregate of 127,013,552 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including 10,118,142 shares of Class A common stock issuable, at our election, upon redemption of common units of i3 Verticals, LLC that are held by the Continuing Equity Owners. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the LLC Agreement, the Continuing Equity Owners are entitled to have their common units redeemed from time to time at each of their options (subject in certain circumstances to time-based and service-based vesting requirements and other limitations) for newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each Common Unit redeemed, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the LLC Agreement. At our election, however, we may effect a direct exchange by i3 Verticals, Inc. of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such common units in lieu of redemption. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their common units remain outstanding. We have also entered into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued to certain Continuing Equity Owners upon such redemption and the shares of Class A common stock issued to certain Continuing Equity Owners in connection with the Reorganization Transactions will be eligible for resale registration, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nHolders of our Class A common stock may be diluted by future issuances of preferred stock or additional Class A common stock or common units in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of our Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to our Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion. We could issue a significant number of shares of Class A common stock in the future in connection with investments or acquisitions. Any of these issuances could dilute our existing stockholders, and such dilution could be significant. Moreover, such dilution could have a material adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of shares of our Class A common stock, either by diluting the voting power of our Class A common\nstock if the preferred stock votes together with the common stock as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the Class A common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the Class A common stock may not wish to purchase Class A common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Class A common stock at the lower conversion price, causing economic dilution to the holders of Class A common stock.\nSales of shares of our Class A common stock in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nIn connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with certain Continuing Equity Owners. Any sales in connection with the Registration Rights Agreement, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially and adversely impact the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nIn the future, we may also issue additional securities if we need to raise capital, including, but not limited to, in connection with acquisitions, which could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nOur corporate headquarters is in Nashville, Tennessee where we occupy approximately 16,000 square feet of office space under a lease that expires in 2027. We lease properties located within various geographic regions in which we conduct business, including Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. Our properties include office spaces and call centers used for operational, sales, management and administrative purposes.\nFor leases that are scheduled to expire during the next 12 months, we may negotiate new lease agreements, renew existing lease agreements, exercise any respective options to extend the existing lease agreements, or use alternate facilities. We believe our facilities are adequate for our needs and believe that we should be able to renew any of our existing leases or secure similar property without an adverse impact on our operations.

Legal Proceedings\nThe information required with respect to this item can be found in Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements contained in this report and is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 3. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nOn June 21, 2018, our Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol IIIV. There is currently no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.\nStockholders\nAs of November 17, 2022, there were 79 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock. The number of record holders does not include persons who held shares of our Class A common stock in nominee or street name accounts through brokers. As of November 17, 2022, there were 53 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph and related information shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.\nThe following graph shows a comparison of cumulative total shareholder return for (1) our Class A common stock, (2) the S&P 500 Index and (3) the S&P Information technology Index. The graph assumes the value of the investment in our common stock and each index was $100.00 on June 21, 2018 and that all dividends, if any, were reinvested. The comparisons reflected in the graph and table are not intended to forecast the future performance of our stock and may not be indicative of our future performance.\nThe following table presents the corresponding data for the periods shown in the graph:\ni3 Verticals, Inc. S&P 500 S&P 500 Information Technology\nJune 21, 2018 $ 100.00 $ 100.00 $ 100.00\nSeptember 30, 2018 $ 176.77 $ 105.97 $ 105.71\nSeptember 30, 2019 $ 154.77 $ 108.25 $ 113.00\nSeptember 30, 2020 $ 194.23 $ 122.30 $ 164.27\nSeptember 30, 2021 $ 186.23 $ 156.65 $ 209.78\nSeptember 30, 2022 $ 154.08 $ 130.40 $ 166.30\nSales of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not issue any Class A common stock in exchange for Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of the LLC Limited Liability Agreement during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. All other sales of unregistered securities during the year ended September 30, 2022, have been previously disclosed in either a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nWe did not repurchase any shares of our Class A or Class B common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2022.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid a cash dividend on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors reviews our dividend policy from time to time and may declare dividends at its discretion; however, our Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined below) places restrictions on the payment of dividends. For further discussion of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, see Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\" Item 6. Reserved Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain amounts in this section may not foot due to rounding.\nExecutive Overview\nThe Company delivers seamless integrated software and services to customers in strategic vertical markets. Building on its broad suite of software and services solutions, the Company creates and acquires software products to serve the specific needs of its customers. The Company's primary strategic verticals are Public Sector (including Education) and Healthcare.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and other parts of the world. The spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains brought about many precautions at the state and local government levels to mitigate the spread of the virus, including the closure of local government facilities and parks, schools, restaurants, many businesses and other locations of public assembly. Throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 governments imposed restrictions in response to increased transmission rates of COVID-19 and eased such restrictions once the transmission rates declined across multiple cycles.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected overall economic conditions in the United States. The economic impact of these conditions materially impacted our business. Our payment volume fluctuated as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite positive developments, such as the availability of vaccines, there are no reliable estimates of how long the pandemic will continue, how many people are likely to be affected by it or the duration or types of restrictions that will be imposed. For that reason, we are unable to predict the long-term impact of COVID-19 and its variant strains on our business at this time.\nAcquisitions\nA core component of our growth strategy includes a disciplined approach to acquisitions of companies and technology, evidenced by numerous platform acquisitions and tuck-in acquisitions since our inception in 2012. Our acquisitions have opened new strategic vertical markets, increased the number of businesses and organizations to whom we provide solutions and augmented our existing payment and software solutions and capabilities.\nAcquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2022\nSubsequent to September 30, 2022, we completed the acquisition of two business. One of the businesses is within the Companys Public Sector vertical and is a leading provider of enterprise software solutions for the motor carrier and motor vehicle markets in the U.S. and Canada. The other business supplements our capabilities in the Merchant Services segment. Total purchase consideration included $89.5 million in cash on hand and revolving line of credit proceeds.\nAcquisitions during the year ended September 30, 2022\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we completed the acquisition of three businesses to expand our software offerings in the Public Sector and Healthcare verticals. Total purchase consideration was $107.7 million, including $101.4 million in cash on hand and proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility, and $6.3 million in contingent consideration.\nAcquisitions during the year ended September 30, 2021\nOn November 17, 2020, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of ImageSoft, Inc. to expand our software offerings, primarily in the Public Sector vertical. Total purchase consideration was $46.3 million, including $40.0 million in cash consideration, funded by proceeds from our revolving credit facility, and $6.3 million in contingent consideration.\nOn February 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Business Information Systems, GP, a Tennessee general partnership and Business Information Systems, Inc., a Tennessee corporation (collectively BIS) to expand our software offerings, primarily in the Public Sector vertical. Total purchase consideration was $95.5 million, including $52.5 million in cash on hand and proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility, 1,202,914 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, and $7.8 million in contingent consideration.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we also completed the acquisitions of six unrelated businesses, to expand the Companys software offerings in the Public Sector and Healthcare vertical markets, and to add proprietary technology that will augment the Companys existing platform across several verticals. Total purchase consideration was $65.5 million, including $57.0 million in revolving credit facility proceeds, and $8.5 million of contingent consideration.\nThe results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included in our financial statements since the applicable acquisition dates. For additional information, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur Revenue and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue from software licenses and subscriptions, other software related services, and volume-based payment processing fees (discount fees), and to a lesser extent, software licensing subscriptions, ongoing support and other POS-related solutions that we provide to our customers directly and through our distribution partners. Volume-based fees represent a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction processed. Revenues are also derived from a variety of fixed transaction or service fees, including authorization fees, convenience fees, statement fees, annual fees and fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks.\nInterchange and network fees. Interchange and network fees consist primarily of pass-through fees that make up a portion of discount fee revenue. These include assessment fees payable to card associations, which are a percentage of the processing volume we generate from Visa and Mastercard. Upon our adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) on October 1, 2019, these fees are presented net within revenue.\nExpenses\nOther costs of services. Other costs of services include costs directly attributable to processing and bank sponsorship costs. These also include related costs such as residual payments to our distribution partners, which are based on a percentage of the net revenues (revenue less interchange and network fees) generated from customer referrals. Losses resulting from excessive chargebacks against a customer are included in other cost of services. The cost of equipment sold is also included in cost of services. Interchange and other costs of services are recognized at the time the customers transactions are processed.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries and other employment costs, professional services, rent and utilities and other operating costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense consists of depreciation on our investments in property, equipment and computer hardware and software. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Amortization expense for acquired intangible assets and internally developed software is recognized using a proportional cash flow method. Amortization expense for internally developed software is recognized over the estimated useful life of the asset. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreement.\nInterest expense, net. Our interest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and Exchangeable Notes, and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.\nHow We Assess Our Business\nMerchant Services\nOur Merchant Services segment provides comprehensive payment solutions to businesses and organizations. Our Merchant Services segment includes third-party integrated payment solutions as well as traditional merchant processing services across our strategic vertical markets.\nSoftware and Services\nOur Software and Services segment delivers vertical market software solutions to customers across all of our strategic vertical markets. These solutions often include embedded payments or other recurring services.\nOther\nOur Other category includes corporate overhead expenses, when presenting reportable segment information.\nFor additional information on our segments, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe evaluate our performance through key performance indicators, including:\nannualized recurring revenue (\"ARR\");\nsoftware and related services as a percentage of total revenue; and\nthe dollar volume of payments our customers process through us (payment volume).\nARR is the annualized revenue derived from software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements, software monetized with transaction-based fees, software maintenance, recurring software-based services, payments revenue and other recurring revenue sources within the quarter. This excludes contracts that are not recurring or are one-time in nature. We focus on ARR because it helps us to assess the health and trajectory of our business. ARR does not have a standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. It should be reviewed independently of revenue and it is not a forecast. The active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. ARR for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $281.2 million and $210.8 million, respectively, representing a period-to-period growth rate of 33.4%.\nSoftware and related services revenue includes the sale of subscriptions, recurring services, ongoing support, licenses, and installation and implementation services specific to software. We focus on software and related services revenue as a percentage of total revenue because it is a strategic goal to expand the software services we provide our customers. Software and related services typically result in long-term partnerships with strong recurring revenues. Software and related services revenue as a percentage of total revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was 49% and 39%.\nOur payment volume for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $22.6 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively, representing a period-to-period growth rate of 20%. We focus on payment volume because it is a reflection of the scale and economic activity of our customer base and because a significant part of our revenue is derived as a percentage of our customers dollar volume receipts. Payment volume reflects the addition of new customers and same store payment volume growth of existing customers, partially offset by customer attrition during the period.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021\nThe following table presents our historical results of operations for the periods indicated:\nYear ended September 30, Change\n(in thousands) 2022 2021 Amount %\nRevenue $ 317,862 $ 224,124 $ 93,738 41.8 %\nOperating expenses\nOther costs of services 73,367 57,706 15,661 27.1 %\nSelling general and administrative 193,790 134,872 58,918 43.7 %\nDepreciation and amortization 29,424 24,418 5,006 20.5 %\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 23,725 7,140 16,585 n/m\nTotal operating expenses 320,306 224,136 96,170 42.9 %\nLoss from operations (2,444) (12) (2,432) n/m\nOther expenses\nInterest expense, net 14,775 9,799 4,976 50.8 %\nOther expense (income) 991 (2,595) 3,586 n/m\nTotal other expenses 15,766 7,204 8,562 118.9 %\nLoss before income taxes (18,210) (7,216) (10,994) 152.4 %\nProvision for income taxes 5,007 623 4,384 n/m\nNet loss (23,217) (7,839) (15,378) 196.2 %\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest (6,115) (3,382) (2,733) 80.8 %\nNet loss attributable to i3 Verticals $ (17,102) $ (4,457) $ (12,645) 283.7 %\nn/m = not meaningful\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $93.7 million, or 41.8%, to $317.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $224.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was principally driven by incremental revenue from acquisitions completed during the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years of $61.8 million, net of intercompany eliminations, all of which were within Software and Services. In addition to our growth through acquisitions, revenue from existing businesses grew, resulting from growth in software and related services revenues, primarily in our Public Sector verticals, and an increase in payment volume from new and existing customers across the Company.\nRevenue within Software and Services increased $79.0 million, or 69.0%, to $193.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $114.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was principally driven by growth in software and related services revenues in our Public Sector and Healthcare verticals.\nRevenue within Merchant Services increased $12.6 million, or 11.3%, to $124.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $111.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Payment volume from new and existing customers within Merchant Services increased $3.4 billion, or 19.5%, to $20.5 billion for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $17.1 billion for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nOther Costs of Services\nOther costs of services increased $15.7 million, or 27.1%, to $73.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $57.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in other cost of services within the Merchant Services segment, driven by the increase in payment volume.\nOther costs of services within Merchant Services increased $8.4 million, or 16.4%, to $59.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $51.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, driven primarily by the growth in payment volume.\nOther costs of services within Software and Services increased $5.2 million, or 60.0%, to $13.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $8.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Acquisitions completed during the 2021 and 2022 fiscal years contributed an incremental $3.4 million, net of intercompany eliminations, to our other cost of services for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $58.9 million, or 43.7%, to $193.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $134.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was principally driven by a $48.2 million increase in employment expense, primarily resulting from an increase in headcount that resulted from acquisitions and an increase in stock compensation expense. The majority of the remaining increase was comprised of increases in technology expense, travel expense, rental expense and advertising expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $5.0 million, or 20.5%, to $29.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $24.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Amortization expense increased $4.8 million to $26.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $22.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to greater amortization expense resulting from acquisitions completed during the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years. Depreciation expense increased $0.2 million to $2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $2.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration to be paid in connection with acquisitions was a charge of $23.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 due to the performance of some of our acquisitions exceeding our expectations. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended September 30, 2021 was a charge of $7.1 million.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net, increased $5.0 million, or 50.8%, to $14.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $9.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase reflected a higher average interest rate and a higher average outstanding debt balance for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nOther expense (income)\nOther expense was $1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, relating to adjustments of liabilities under our Tax Receivable Agreement related to the remeasurement of the underlying deferred tax asset for changes in estimated income tax rates. Other income was $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, relating to a net gain on sales of investments of $2.1 million and adjustments of liabilities under our Tax Receivable Agreement related to the remeasurement of the underlying deferred tax asset for changes in estimated income tax rates of $0.5 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was to $5.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The provision for deferred income taxes increased to an provision for the year ended September 30, 2022 from a benefit for the year ended September 30, 2021. Additionally, the provision for current income tax expense increased for the year ended September 30, 2022 from the year ended September 30, 2021, due to the mix of earnings within the Company. Our effective tax rate of (27)% for the year ended September 30, 2022 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the increase in the valuation allowance and as well as decrease in state taxes and increase in the tax effect of the revaluation of liabilities. i3 Verticals, Inc. is subject to federal, state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income of i3 Verticals, LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.\nYear Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2020\nFor discussion of our results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on November 22, 2021.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer and business spending patterns. Revenues during the first quarter of the calendar year, which is our second fiscal quarter, tend to decrease in comparison to the remaining three quarters of the calendar year on a same store basis. This decrease is due to the relatively higher number and amount of electronic payment transactions related to seasonal retail events, such as holiday and vacation spending in their second, third and fourth quarters of the calendar year. The number of business days in a month or quarter also may affect seasonal fluctuations. Revenue in our Education vertical fluctuates with the school calendar. Revenue for our Education customers is strongest in August, September, October, January and February, at the start of each semester, and generally weakens throughout the semester, with little revenue in the summer months of June and July. Operating expenses show less seasonal fluctuation, with the result that net income is subject to the same seasonal factors as our revenues. The growth in our business may have partially overshadowed seasonal trends to date, and seasonal impacts on our business may be more pronounced in the future. Furthermore, we are not able to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have historically financed our operations (not including acquisitions) and working capital through net cash from operating activities. As of September 30, 2022, we had $3.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of $90.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to the financial covenants. We usually minimize cash balances by making payments on our revolving credit facility to minimize borrowings and interest expense. As of September 30, 2022, we had borrowings outstanding of $185.0 million under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nOur primary cash needs are to fund working capital requirements, invest in our technology infrastructure, fund acquisitions and related contingent consideration, make scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and pay tax distributions to members. We historically have had positive cash flow provided by operations. We currently expect that our cash flow from operations, current cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures and to service our debt obligations for at least the next twelve months and foreseeable future.\nOur liquidity profile reflects our completed offering in February 2020 of an aggregate principal amount of $138.0 million in 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025, with substantially all the proceeds being used to pay down outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, as well as our September 2020 Public Offering as described below under the heading Follow-on Offerings. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased $21.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.4 million. We recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $2.3 million due to the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the repurchased portion of the Exchangeable Notes at the dates of repurchases. We may elect from time to time to purchase our outstanding debt in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such debt repurchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, applicable securities law and other factors.\nOur Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended, requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio not less than 3.00 to 1.00, a total leverage ratio not exceeding 5.00 to 1.00 and a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio not exceeding 3.25 to 1.00, provided that for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately following a qualified acquisition, the total leverage ratio and the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio would increase by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio of 8.17x, 3.68x and 2.24x, respectively. Although we believe our liquidity position remains strong, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds, in the form of debt or equity, or to amend our Senior Secured Credit Facility on terms acceptable to us, if at all, even if we determined such actions were necessary in the future.\nAny material adverse change in customer demand and our ability to retain customers, competitive market forces, as well as other factors listed under the heading Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements, and in our risk factors included herein could affect our ability to continue to fund our liquidity needs from business operations.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the following comparative periods.\nYear Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 45,846 $ 44,533\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (113,045) $ (149,306)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 73,033 $ 102,103\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $1.3 million to $45.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $44.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. While our net loss increased $15.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from the year ended September 30, 2021, most of this increase was driven by non-cash expenses that do not impact cash flows from operating activities. The primary reason cash provided by operating activities increased despite the increase in net loss was that the increase in net loss was driven by an increase in non-cash contingent consideration of $16.6 million, an increase in equity-based compensation expense of $5.4 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $5.0 million, all of which increase the net loss but are not cash expenditures. Other changes include decreases in operating assets and liabilities of $17.9 million, which are impacted by the timing of collections and payments, an increase in the provision for deferred income taxes of $2.9 million, a decrease in the gain on sale of investments of $2.1 million and an increase in non-cash lease expense of $1.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $36.3 million to $113.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $149.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The largest driver of cash used in investing activities for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we used $100.7 million of cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired compared to $142.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Additionally, expenditures for purchases of merchant portfolios and residual buyouts decreased $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. These changes in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by an increase in expenditures for capitalized software of $4.0 million and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments of $3.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities decreased $29.1 million to $73.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $102.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of an increase in payments on the revolving credit facility of $56.7 million and an increase in cash paid for contingent consideration up to our original estimates of $22.4 million, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the revolving credit facility of $32.9 million and an increase in proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of $17.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from year ended September 30, 2021.\nYear Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2020\nFor a discussion of the cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the year ended September 30, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 22, 2021.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn May 9, 2019, we replaced our then existing credit facility with a new Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the guarantors and lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the Senior Secured Credit Facility). The Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended in October, 2022, consists of a $375.0 million revolving credit facility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility provides that we have the right to seek additional commitments to provide additional term loan facilities or additional revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount up to $50.0 million so long as, among other things, after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such additional borrowings and any related transactions, our consolidated interest coverage ratio would not be less than 3.00 to 1.00, our total leverage ratio would not exceed 5.00 to 1.00 and our consolidated senior leverage ratio would not exceed 3.25 to 1.00, provided that for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately following a qualified acquisition, the total leverage ratio and the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio would increase by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations.\nThe provision of any such additional amounts under the additional term loan facilities or additional revolving credit commitments are subject to certain additional conditions and the receipt of certain additional commitments by existing or additional lenders. The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are not under any obligation to provide any such additional term loan facilities or revolving credit commitments.\nThe proceeds of the Senior Secured Credit Facility, together with proceeds from any additional amounts under the additional term loan facilities or additional revolving credit commitments, may only be used by us to (i) finance working capital, capital expenditures and other lawful corporate purposes, (ii) finance permitted acquisitions and (iii) to refinance certain existing indebtedness.\nBorrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility will be made, at our option, at the base rate or the Term SOFR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The base rate is a fluctuating rate of interest per annum equal to the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus \u00bd of 1%, (b) the interest announced from time to time by\nBank of America as its prime rate and (c) the Term SOFR rate plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1%. The Term SOFR rate will be the rate of interest per annum equal to SOFR (based upon an interest period of one, three or six months), plus an adjustment of 0.10%. The applicable margin is based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio, as reflected in the schedule below:\nConsolidated Total Leverage Ratio Commitment Fee Letter of Credit Fee Term SOFR Rate Loans Base Rate Loans\n> 3.00 to 1.0 0.30% 3.25% 3.25% 1.25%\n> 2.50 to 1.0 but < 3.00 to 1.0 0.25% 2.75% 2.75% 0.75%\n> 2.00 to 1.0 but < 2.50 to 1.0 0.20% 2.50% 2.50% 0.50%\n< 2.00 to 1.0 0.15% 2.25% 2.25% 0.25%\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, we will be required to pay a commitment fee equal to the product of between 0.15% and 0.30% (the applicable percentage depending on our consolidated total leverage ratio as reflected in the schedule above) times the actual daily amount by which $375.0 million exceeds the total amount outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and available to be drawn under all outstanding letters of credit.\nWe will be permitted to voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount and repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, whether such amounts are issued under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or under the additional term loan facilities or additional revolving credit facilities, at any time without premium or penalty.\nIn addition, if the total amount borrowed under the Senior Secured Credit Facility exceeds $375.0 million at any time, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires us to prepay such excess outstanding amounts.\nAll obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by i3 Verticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and each of i3 Verticals, Inc.s existing and future direct and indirect material, wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by first-priority security interests in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets, i3 Verticals, Inc. and each subsidiary guarantor, in each case whether owned on the date of the initial borrowings or thereafter acquired.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility places certain restrictions on the ability of us, i3 Verticals, Inc. and their restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt and liens; merge, consolidate or liquidate; dispose of assets; enter into hedging arrangements; make certain restricted payments; undertake transactions with affiliates; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; make certain investments; prepay or modify the terms of certain indebtedness; and modify the terms of certain organizational agreements.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, certain ERISA events, invalidity of loan documents and certain changes in control.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants with a consolidated interest coverage ratio, total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio of 8.17x, 3.68x and 2.24x, respectively.\nFollow-on Offerings\nOn September 15, 2020, we completed a public offering (the September 2020 Public Offering) of 3,737,500 shares of our Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $23.50 per share, which included a full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 487,500 additional shares of Class A common stock from us. We received approximately $83.4 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering expenses. We used the net proceeds to purchase (1) 3,250,000 Common Units directly from i3 Verticals, LLC, and (2) 487,500 Common Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in full and an equivalent number of Class B common stock (which shares were then canceled) from certain Continuing Equity Owners, in each case at a price per Common Unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of our Class A common stock in the offering. i3 Verticals, LLC received $72.0 million in net\nproceeds from the sale of Common Units to the Company, which we used to repay outstanding indebtedness. In connection with this offering, we recognized an additional deferred tax asset of $3.0 million related to the Tax Receivable Agreement and a corresponding liability of $2.5 million.\nExchangeable Notes\nOn February 18, 2020, i3 Verticals, LLC issued $138.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due February 15, 2025. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.0% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020. The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable on the terms set forth in the Indenture into cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at i3 Verticals, LLCs election. The Exchangeable Notes mature on February 15, 2025, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. We received approximately $132.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Exchangeable Notes, as determined by deducting estimated offering expenses paid to third-parties from the aggregate principal amount. i3 Verticals, LLC used a portion of the net proceeds of the Exchangeable Notes offering to pay down outstanding borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facility in connection with the effectiveness of the operative provisions of the Amendment and to pay the cost of the note hedge transactions. During the year ended September 30, 2020, we repurchased $21.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.4 million. As of September 30, 2022, $117.0 million of the original aggregate principal amount of $138.0 million was outstanding.\nAt-the-Market Program\nOn August 20, 2021, we, together with i3 Verticals, LLC, entered into an at-the-market offering sales agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and BTIG, LLC (each a Sales Agent), under which we may issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $125 million (the ATM Program). During the quarter and year ended September 30, 2022, we sold 722,000 shares of Class A common stock, raising $17.9 million in net proceeds under the ATM Program. The aggregate compensation paid by the Company to the Sales Agents with respect to such sales was $0.4 million. As of September 30, 2022, we had a remaining capacity to sell up to $107.1 million of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program.\nThe proceeds from these issuances were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and for other general corporate purposes.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes our material cash requirements as of September 30, 2022 related to contracts, leases and borrowings:\nPayments Due by Period\nMaterial Cash Requirements Total\nLess than 1 year\n1 to 3 years\n3 to 5 years\nMore than 5 years\n(in thousands)\nProcessing minimums(1)\n$ 5,832 $ 4,512 $ 1,320 $ - $ -\nFacility leases 21,166 5,492 8,798 4,865 2,011\nSenior Secured Credit Facility and related interest(2)\n204,763 11,260 193,503 - -\nExchangeable Notes and related interest(3)\n119,779 1,170 118,609 - -\nContingent consideration(4)\n22,833 21,385 1,448 - -\nTotal $ 374,373 $ 43,819 $ 323,678 $ 4,865 $ 2,011\n__________________________\n1.We have non-exclusive agreements with several processors to provide us services related to transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. Certain of these agreements require us to submit a minimum monthly number of transactions for processing. If we submit a number of transactions that is lower than the minimum, we are required to pay to the processor the fees it would have received if we had submitted the required minimum number of transactions.\n2.We estimated interest payments through the maturity of our Senior Secured Credit Facility by applying the interest rate of 6.24% in effect on the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022, plus the unused fee rate of 0.30% in effect as of September 30, 2022.\n3.We calculated interest payments through the maturity of our Exchangeable Notes by applying the coupon interest rate of 1.00% on the outstanding principal balance as of September 30, 2022 of $117.0 million.\n4.In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we may be obligated to pay the seller of the acquired entity certain amounts of contingent consideration as set forth in the relevant purchasing documents, whereby additional consideration may be due upon the achievement of certain specified financial performance targets. i3 Verticals, Inc. accounts for the fair values of such contingent payments in accordance with the Level 3 financial instrument fair value hierarchy at the close of each subsequent reporting period. The acquisition-date fair value of contingent consideration is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. i3 Verticals, Inc. subsequently reassesses such fair value based on probability estimates with respect to the acquired entitys likelihood of achieving the respective financial performance targets.\nPotential payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not reflected in this table. See -Tax Receivable Agreement below.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nWe are a party to a Tax Receivable Agreement with i3 Verticals, LLC and each of the Continuing Equity Owners, as described in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the Tax Receivable Agreement, we have been required to establish a liability in our consolidated financial statements. That liability, which will increase upon the redemptions or exchanges of Common Units for our Class A common stock, generally represents 85% of the estimated future tax benefits, if any, relating to the increase in tax basis associated with the Common Units we received as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and other redemptions or exchanges by holders of Common Units. If this election is made, the accelerated payment will be based on the present value of 100% of the estimated future tax benefits and, as a result, the associated liability reported on our consolidated financial statements may be increased. We expect that the payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the holders of Common Units, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the redemption or exchange, whether such redemptions or exchanges are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future and the tax rate then applicable as well as the portion of our payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement constituting imputed interest. We intend to fund the payment of the amounts due under the Tax Receivable Agreement out of the cash savings that we actually realize in respect of the attributes to which Tax Receivable Agreement relates.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the total amount due under the Tax Receivable Agreement was $40.8 million, and payments to the Continuing Equity Owners related to exchanges through September 30, 2022 will range from approximately $0 to $3.3 million per year and are expected to be paid over the next 26 years years. The amounts recorded as of September 30, 2022, approximate the current estimate of expected tax savings and are subject to change after the filing of the Companys U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement with respect to subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. Estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration paid and identifiable assets acquired and assumed in acquisitions, goodwill and intangible asset impairment review, determination of performance obligations for revenue recognition, loss reserves, assumptions used in the calculation of equity-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes, and certain tax assets and liabilities as well as the related valuation allowances.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a summary of our critical accounting estimates for which the nature of managements assumptions are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and for which the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nContingent Consideration in Acquisitions\nOn occasion, we may have acquisitions that include contingent consideration. Accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of any contingent purchase consideration at the acquisition date. Where relevant, the fair value of material contingent consideration included in an acquisition is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe contingent consideration is revalued each period until it is settled. Management reviews the historical and projected performance of each acquisition with contingent consideration and uses an income probability method to revalue the contingent consideration. The revaluation requires management to make certain assumptions and represent management's best estimate at the valuation date. The probabilities are determined based on a management review of the expected likelihood of triggering events that would cause a change in the contingent consideration paid. For example, if managements forecasted performance for an acquisition increased, we would have anticipated a higher probability of contingent consideration being paid on the acquisition and would have recorded additional losses from the change in fair value of contingent consideration. Conversely, if managements forecasted performance for an acquisition decreased, we would have anticipated a higher probability of contingent consideration being paid on the acquisition and would have recorded a gain from change in fair value of contingent consideration. As of September 30, 2022, the fair value of contingent consideration recorded is $22.8 million, with maximum contingent consideration payout of $81.3 million dependent upon achievement of specified financial performance targets, as defined in the purchase agreements.\nGoodwill\nWe test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at least annually, absent some triggering event that would require an interim impairment assessment. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of July 1 each year.\nIn our goodwill impairment review, we use significant estimates and assumptions that include the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Our assessment of qualitative factors involves significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. In a quantitative assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on a combination of techniques, including the present value of future cash flows, applicable multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding discount rates, growth rates and our future long-term business plans. Changes in any of these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the associated goodwill impairment charge for each reporting unit. For example, if managements forecasted earnings decreased for a reporting unit, we may have recorded an impairment loss for that reporting unit.\nRelated Parties\nTransactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out at an arm's length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-dealing markets may not exist. A description of related-party transactions is provided in Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended, consisted of a $275 million revolving credit facility, together with an option to increase the revolving credit facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an additional principal amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate (subject to the receipt of additional commitments for any such incremental loan amounts). As discussed in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, effective October 3, 2022, the Senior Secured Credit Facility was amended to, among other things, increase the maximum amount of the revolving credit facility to $375 million.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Senior Secured Credit Facility accrues interest at Term SOFR (based upon an interest period of one, three or six months), plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 3.25% (3.25% as of September 30, 2022), or the base rate (defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) Term SOFR, plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.25% (1.25% as of September 30, 2022), in each case depending upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to pay unused commitment fees of 0.15% to 0.30% (0.30% as of September 30, 2022) on any undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees of up to 3.25% on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit issued under the agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires maintenance of certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis as follows: (i) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00, provided, that for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately following a qualified acquisition (each a Leverage Increase Period), the required ratio set forth above may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations and (iii) a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, provided, that for each Leverage Increase Period, the consolidated senior leverage ratio may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations. As of September 30, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants and there was $90.0 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, subject to the financial covenants.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had borrowings of $185.0 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facility. A 1.0% increase or decrease in the interest rate applicable to such borrowing (which was the Term SOFR rate) would have had a $1.9 million dollar impact on the results of the business.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nAs a result of our international operations, we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks. Because our international operations are not yet material to our consolidated results of operations, a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, \"Leases\", using the modified retrospective adoption method on October 1, 2020.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nNashville, Tennessee\nNovember 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2020.\ni3 Verticals, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3,490 $ 3,641\nAccounts receivable, net 53,334 38,500\nSettlement assets 7,540 4,768\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 19,445 11,214\nTotal current assets 83,809 58,123\nProperty and equipment, net 5,670 5,902\nRestricted cash 12,735 9,522\nCapitalized software, net 52,341 41,371\nGoodwill 353,639 292,243\nIntangible assets, net 195,919 171,706\nDeferred tax asset 43,458 49,992\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 17,678 14,479\nOther assets 5,063 8,462\nTotal assets $ 770,312 $ 651,800\nLiabilities and equity\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 9,342 $ 7,865\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 57,833 50,815\nSettlement obligations 7,540 4,768\nDeferred revenue 31,975 29,862\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 4,568 3,201\nTotal current liabilities 111,258 96,511\nLong-term debt, less current portion and debt issuance costs, net 287,020 200,605\nLong-term tax receivable agreement obligations 40,812 39,122\nOperating lease liabilities, less current portion 13,994 11,960\nOther long-term liabilities 9,540 14,011\nTotal liabilities 462,624 362,209\nCommitments and contingencies (see Note 15)\nStockholders' equity\nPreferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 10,000,000 shares authorized; 0 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\n- -\nClass A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 150,000,000 shares authorized; 22,986,448 and 22,026,098 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n2 2\nClass B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, 40,000,000 shares authorized; 10,118,142 and 10,229,142 shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n1 1\nAdditional paid-in-capital 241,958 211,237\nAccumulated deficit (23,582) (6,480)\nTotal stockholders' equity 218,379 204,760\nNon-controlling interest 89,309 84,831\nTotal equity 307,688 289,591\nTotal liabilities and equity $ 770,312 $ 651,800\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ni3 Verticals, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRevenue $ 317,862 $ 224,124 $ 150,134\nOperating expenses\nOther costs of services 73,367 57,706 47,230\nSelling general and administrative 193,790 134,872 78,323\nDepreciation and amortization 29,424 24,418 18,217\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 23,725 7,140 (1,409)\nTotal operating expenses 320,306 224,136 142,361\n(Loss) income from operations (2,444) (12) 7,773\nOther expenses\nInterest expense, net 14,775 9,799 8,926\nOther expense (income) 991 (2,595) 2,621\nTotal other expenses 15,766 7,204 11,547\nLoss before income taxes (18,210) (7,216) (3,774)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 5,007 623 (2,795)\nNet loss (23,217) (7,839) (979)\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest (6,115) (3,382) (560)\nNet loss attributable to i3 Verticals, Inc. $ (17,102) $ (4,457) $ (419)\nNet loss per share attributable to Class A common stockholders:\nBasic $ (0.77) $ (0.21) $ (0.03)\nDiluted $ (0.77) $ (0.22) $ (0.03)\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding:\nBasic 22,249,656 20,994,598 14,833,378\nDiluted 22,249,656 31,714,191 27,429,801\nSee Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\ni3 Verticals, Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nClass A Common Stock Class B Common Stock Additional Paid-In Capital Retained Earnings (Deficit) Non-Controlling Interest Total Equity\nShares Amount Shares Amount\nBalance at September 30, 2019 14,444,115 $ 1 12,921,637 $ 1 $ 82,380 $ (2,309) $ 62,368 $ 142,441\nAdjustment related to prior periods -

ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS\ni3 Verticals, Inc. (the Company) was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 17, 2018. The Company was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering (IPO) of its Class A common stock and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of i3 Verticals, LLC and its subsidiaries. i3 Verticals, LLC was founded in 2012 and delivers seamlessly integrated software and payment solutions to customers in strategic vertical markets. The Companys headquarters are in located Nashville, Tennessee, with operations throughout the United States. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to we, us, our, i3 Verticals and the Company refer to i3 Verticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including i3 Verticals, LLC.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company completed certain reorganization transactions, which among other things, resulted in i3 Verticals, Inc. being the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC (the \"Reorganization Transactions\").\nFollowing the completion of the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, the Company is a holding company and the principal asset that it owns are the common units in i3 Verticals, LLC. i3 Verticals, Inc. operates and controls all of i3 Verticals, LLC's operations and, through i3 Verticals, LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts i3 Verticals, LLC's business. i3 Verticals, Inc. has a majority economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. As the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC, i3 Verticals, Inc. consolidates the financial results of i3 Verticals, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by other owners other (the Continuing Equity Owners).\nPublic Offerings\nOn September 15, 2020, the Company completed a primary public offering (the September 2020 Public Offering) of 3,737,500 shares of its Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $23.50 per share, which included a full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 487,500 additional shares of Class A Common Stock from the Company. The Company received approximately $83,400 of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds to purchase (1) 3,250,000 Common Units directly from i3 Verticals, LLC, and (2) 487,500 Common Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in full and an equivalent number of Class B common stock (which shares were then canceled) from certain Continuing Equity Owners, in each case at a price per Common Unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of the Company's Class A common stock in the offering. i3 Verticals, LLC received $72,018 in net proceeds from the sale of Common Units to the Company, which it used to repay outstanding indebtedness.\ni3 Verticals, Inc. is the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC and as a result, consolidates the financial results of i3 Verticals, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners.\nAs the Reorganization Transactions are considered transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements retroactively reflect the accounts of i3 Verticals, LLC for periods prior to the IPO and Reorganization Transactions.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe Continuing Equity Owners who own Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC may redeem at each of their options (subject in certain circumstances to time-based vesting requirements) their Common Units for, at the election of i3 Verticals, LLC, cash or newly-issued shares of the Company's Class A common stock.\nAs of September 30, 2022, i3 Verticals, Inc. owned 69.4% of the economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. As of September 30, 2022, the Continuing Equity Owners owned Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC representing approximately 30.6% of the economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC, shares of Class A common stock in the Company representing approximately 0.6% of the economic interest and voting power in the Company, and shares of Class B common stock in i3 Verticals, Inc., representing approximately 30.6% of the voting power in the Company. Combining the Class A common stock and Class B common stock, the Continuing Equity Holders hold approximately 31.1% of the economic interest and voting power in i3 Verticals, Inc.\nAt-the-Market Program\nOn August 20, 2021, the Company, together with i3 Verticals, LLC, entered into an at-the-market offering sales agreement with Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and BTIG, LLC (each a Sales Agent), under which the Company may issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of the Company's Class A common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $125,000 (the ATM Program). During the quarter and year ended September 30, 2022, the Company sold 722,000 shares of Class A common stock, raising $17,869 in net proceeds under the ATM Program. The aggregate compensation paid by the Company to the Sales Agents with respect to such sales was $440. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had a remaining capacity to sell up to $107,131 of our Class A common stock under the ATM Program.\nThe proceeds from these issuances were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility and for other general corporate purposes.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and pursuant to the reporting and disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash on hand, checking accounts, and savings accounts to be cash and cash equivalents. At times, the balance in these accounts may exceed federal insured limits. Cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments readily transferable into cash with an original maturity less than 90 days.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash represents funds held in escrow related to acquisitions or held-on-deposit with processing banks pursuant to agreements to cover potential merchant losses. It is presented as long-term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since the related agreements extend beyond the next twelve months. Following the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230), the Company includes restricted cash along with the cash and cash equivalents balance for presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Policies\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of uncollateralized credit card processing residual payments due from processing banks requiring payment within thirty days following the end of each month. Accounts receivable also include amounts due from the sales of the Companys technology solutions to its customers. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary, which reflects managements best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The allowance is estimated based on managements knowledge of its customers, historical loss experience and existing economic conditions. Accounts receivable and the allowance are written-off when, in managements opinion, all collection efforts have been exhausted. The Companys allowance for doubtful accounts was $590 and $181 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively; however, actual write-offs may exceed estimated amounts.\nSettlement Assets and Obligations\nSettlement assets and obligations result when funds are temporarily held or owed by the Company on behalf of merchants, consumers, schools, and other institutions. Timing differences, interchange expenses, merchant reserves and exceptional items cause differences between the amount received from the card networks and the amount funded to counterparties. These balances arising in the settlement process are reflected as settlement assets and obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of merchant reserves, settlement assets or settlement obligations are generally collected and paid within one to four days. Settlement assets and settlement obligations were $7,540 as of September 30, 2022 and $4,768 as of September 30, 2021.\nInventories\nInventories consist of point-of-sale equipment to be sold to customers and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average or specific basis, or net realizable value. Inventories were $4,121 and $2,220 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost or, if acquired through a business combination or an asset acquisition, fair value at the date of acquisition. Depreciation and amortization are provided over the assets estimated useful lives (or, if obtained in connection with a business acquisition, over their estimated remaining useful lives) using the straight-line method, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term.\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for renewals or betterments are capitalized. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset. There were no impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nCapitalized Software\nDevelopment costs for software to be sold or leased to customers are capitalized once technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established when the Company has completed a detailed program design and has determined that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is generally available to customers. Software development costs are amortized using the greater of the straight-line method or the usage method over its estimated useful life, which is generally estimated to be three years.\nAdditionally, development costs for software to be used internally is capitalized under similar guidance as discussed above. Once the software product is in the application development stage, costs are required to be capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary product phase or post implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Overhead, general and administrative, and training costs are not capitalized.\nSoftware development costs may become impaired in situations where development efforts are abandoned due to the viability of a planned project becoming doubtful or due to technological obsolescence of a planned software product. Management evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of capitalized software at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, to determine whether significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in value may have occurred. To the extent estimated net realizable values, which are estimated to equal future undiscounted cash flows, exceed the carrying value, no impairment is necessary. If estimated net realizable values are less than the carrying values, an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were nominal.\nIdentifiable software technology intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are amortized using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding their remaining estimated useful lives. GAAP requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values, and reviewed for impairment. Acquisition technology intangibles net book values are included in capitalized software, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nNotes Receivable\nNotes receivable consist of loans made to unrelated entities. Notes receivable were $5,125 and $4,695 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAcquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions have been recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. Where relevant, the fair value of contingent consideration included in an acquisition is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of customer relationships and non-compete assets acquired is identified using the Income Approach. The fair values of trade names and internally-developed software acquired are identified using the Relief from Royalty Method. The fair value of deferred revenue is identified using the Adjusted Fulfillment Cost Method. After the purchase price has been allocated, goodwill is recorded to the extent the total consideration paid for the acquisition, including the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration, if any, exceeds the sum of the fair values of the separately identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Acquisition costs for business combinations are expensed when incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nAcquisitions not meeting the accounting criteria to be accounted for as a business combination are accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at its purchase price, inclusive of acquisition costs, which is allocated among the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.\nThe operating results of an acquisition are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of such acquisition. Acquisitions completed during the year ended September 30, 2022 contributed $35,840 and $5,170 of revenue and net income, respectively, to the results in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year then ended.\nGoodwill\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company tests goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.\nThe Companys goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in business combinations. The goodwill generated from the business combinations is primarily related to the value placed on the employee workforce and expected synergies. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred. Such changes may include, among others, a significant decline in expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, and unforeseen competition. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit. Factors the Company considers in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of the Companys reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of its reporting units, sustained decrease in its share price, and other relevant entity specific events. If the Company determines not to perform the qualitative assessment or if it determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative test for that reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. Subsequent to the adoption on January 1, 2017 of ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment equal to the excess carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFor a discussion of the estimation methodology, the qualitative factors considered when performing a qualitative assessment and the significance of various inputs, please see the subheading below titled Use of Estimates.\nThe Company has determined that it has five reporting units as of the date of the most recent annual good impairment test. For each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company performed a quantitative assessment for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that none of the reporting units were impaired.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets include acquired customer relationships, residual buyouts, referral agreements, trademarks, trade names, website development costs and non-compete agreements. Customer relationships represent the fair value of customer relationships purchased by the Company. Residual buyouts represent the right to not have to pay a residual to an independent sales agent related to certain future transactions with the agents referred\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nmerchants. Referral agreements represent the right to exclusively obtain referrals from a partner for their customers' credit card processing services.\nThe Company amortizes definite lived identifiable intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed or otherwise utilized. The estimated useful lives of the Companys customer-related intangible assets approximate the expected distribution of cash flows, whether straight-line or accelerated, generated from each asset. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreement.\nManagement evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, at least annually, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, to determine whether significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in the useful life or impairment in value may have occurred. There were no impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nIncome Taxes\ni3 Verticals, Inc. is taxed as a corporation and pays corporate federal, state and local taxes on income allocated to it from i3 Verticals, LLC based on i3 Verticals, Inc.'s economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. i3 Verticals, LLC's members, including the Company, are liable for federal, state and local income taxes based on their share of i3 Verticals, LLC's pass-through taxable income. i3 Verticals, LLC is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, but is subject to and reports entity level tax in both Tennessee and Texas. In addition, certain subsidiaries of i3 Verticals, LLC are corporations that are subject to state and federal income taxes.\nThe amount provided for state income taxes is based upon the amounts of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable at the date of the consolidated financial statements as a result of all events recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of enacted tax laws.\nUnder GAAP, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. See additional discussion in Note 11.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration\nOn occasion, the Company may have acquisitions which include contingent consideration. Accounting for business combinations requires the Company to estimate the fair value of any contingent purchase consideration at the acquisition date. For a discussion of the estimate methodology and the significance of various inputs, please see the subheading below titled Use of Estimates. Changes in estimates regarding the fair value contingent purchase consideration are reflected as adjustments to the related liability and recognized within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Short and long-term contingent liabilities are presented within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\nClassification of Financial Instruments\nThe Company classifies certain financial instruments issued as either equity or as liabilities. Determination of classification is based upon the underlying properties of the instrument. See specific discussion regarding the nature of instruments issued, the presentation on the consolidated financial statements and the related valuation method applied in Notes 10, 13, and 14.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nRevenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The Company accrues for rights of refund, processing errors or penalties, or other related allowances based on historical experience. The Company utilized the portfolio approach practical expedient within ASC 606-10-10-4 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Objectives and the significant financing component practical expedient within ASC 606-10-32-18 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-The Existence of a Significant Financing Component in the Contract in performing the analysis.\nThe Company's revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is derived from the following sources:\nSoftware and related services - Includes sales of software as a service, transaction-based fees, ongoing software maintenance and support, software licenses and other professional services related to our software offerings\nPayments - Includes volume-based payment processing fees (discount fees), gateway fees and other related fixed transaction or service fees\nOther - Includes sales of equipment, non-software related professional services and other revenues\nRevenues from sales of the Companys software are recognized when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Sales of software licenses are categorized into one of two categories of intellectual property in accordance with ASC 606, functional or symbolic. The key distinction is whether the license represents a right to use (functional) or a right to access (symbolic) intellectual property. The Company generates sales of one-time software licenses, which is functional intellectual property. Revenue from functional intellectual property is recognized at a point in time, when delivered to the customer. The Company also offers access to its software under software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements, which represent services arrangements. Revenue from SaaS arrangements is recognized over time, over the term of the agreement.\nDiscount fees represent a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction processed or a specified per transaction amount, depending on the card type. The Company frequently enters into agreements with customers under which the customer engages the Company to provide both payment authorization services and transaction settlement services for all of the cardholder transactions of the customer, regardless of which issuing bank and card network to which the transaction relates. The Companys core performance obligations are to stand ready to provide continuous access to the Companys payment authorization services and transaction settlement services in order to be able to process as many transactions as its customers require on a daily basis over the contract term. These services are stand ready obligations, as the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed is not determinable. Under a stand-ready obligation, the Companys performance obligation is defined by each time increment rather than by the underlying activities satisfied over time based on days elapsed. Because the service of standing ready is substantially the same each day and has the same pattern of transfer to the customer, the Company has determined that its stand-ready performance obligation comprises a series of distinct days of service. Discount fees are recognized each day based on the volume or transaction count at the time the merchants transactions are processed.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe Company follows the requirements of ASC 606-10-55 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Principal versus Agent Considerations, which states that the determination of whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. The determination of gross versus net recognition of revenue requires judgment that depends on whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the merchant or whether the Company is acting as an agent of a third party. The assessment is provided separately for each performance obligation identified. Under its agreements, the Company incurs interchange and network pass-through charges from the third-party card issuers and card networks, respectively, related to the provision of payment authorization services. The Company has determined that it is acting as an agent with respect to these payment authorization services, based on the following factors: (1) the Company has no discretion over which card issuing bank will be used to process a transaction and is unable to direct the activity of the merchant to another card issuing bank, and (2) interchange and card network rates are pre-established by the card issuers or card networks, and the Company has no latitude in determining these fees. Therefore, revenue allocated to the payment authorization performance obligation is presented net of interchange and card network fees paid to the card issuing banks and card networks, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nWith regards to the Company's discount fees, generally, where the Company has control over merchant pricing, merchant portability, credit risk and ultimate responsibility for the customer relationship, revenues are reported at the time of sale equal to the full amount of the discount charged to the merchant, less interchange and network fees. Revenues generated from merchant portfolios where the Company does not have control over merchant pricing, liability for merchant losses or credit risk or rights of portability are reported net of interchange and network fees as well as third-party processing costs directly attributable to processing and bank sponsorship costs.\nRevenues are also derived from a variety of fixed transaction or service fees, including authorization fees, convenience fees, statement fees, annual fees, gateway fees, which are charged for accessing our payment and software solutions, and fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Revenues derived from service fees are recognized at the time the services are performed and there are no further performance obligations. Revenue from fixed transactions, which principally relate to the sale of equipment, is recognized upon transfer of ownership and delivery to the customer, after which there are no further performance obligations.\nArrangements may contain multiple performance obligations, such as payment authorization services, transaction settlement services, hardware, software products, maintenance, and professional installation and training services. Revenues are allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each good or service. The selling price for a deliverable is based on standalone selling price, if available, the adjusted market assessment approach, estimated cost plus margin approach, or residual approach. The Company establishes estimated selling price, based on the judgment of the Company's management, considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. In arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company determines allocation of the transaction price at inception of the arrangement and uses the standalone selling prices for the majority of the Company's revenue recognition.\nRevenues from sales of the Companys combined hardware and software element are recognized when each performance obligation has been satisfied which has been determined to be upon the delivery of the product. Revenues derived from service fees are recognized at the time the services are performed and there are no further performance obligations. The Companys professional services, including training, installation, and repair services are recognized as revenue as these services are performed.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe tables below present a disaggregation of the Company's revenue from contracts with customers by product by segment.

Therefore, the Company may have contract assets other than trade accounts receivable for performance obligations that are partially completed, which would typically represent consulting services provided before a milestone is completed in a contract. For the Companys time and materials professional services contracts and transaction processing services, the Company periodically bills the customer after services have been provided but has the right to invoice the customer for services performed to date at any time. Unbilled amounts associated with these services are presented as accounts receivable as the Company has an unconditional right to payment for services performed.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Companys contract assets from contracts with customers was $9,716 and $1,505, respectively\nContract Liabilities\nDeferred revenue represents amounts billed to customers by the Company for services contracts. Payment is typically collected at the start of the contract term. The initial prepaid contract agreement balance is deferred. The balance is then recognized as the services are provided over the contract term. Deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year is recorded as short-term deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The terms for most of the Company's contracts with a deferred revenue component are one year. Substantially all of the Company's deferred revenue is anticipated to be recognized within the next year.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe following table presents the changes in deferred revenue as of and for the year ended September 30, 2022:\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 11,054\nDeferral of revenue 29,966\nRecognition of unearned revenue (10,996)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 30,024\nDeferral of revenue 31,926\nRecognition of unearned revenue (29,861)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 32,089\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nThe Company capitalizes incremental costs to obtain new contracts and contract renewals and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis as an expense over the benefit period, which is generally the contract term, unless a commensurate payment is not expected at renewal. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had $4,185 of capitalized contract costs, compared to $3,851 of capitalized contract costs as of September 30, 2021. The contract costs relate to commissions paid to employees and agents as well as other incentives given to customers to obtain new sales, included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets\" on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded commissions expense related to these costs for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 of $707, $533 and $398 respectively.\nThe Company expenses sales commissions as incurred for the Company's sales commission plans that are paid on recurring monthly revenues, portfolios of existing customers, or have a substantive stay requirement prior to payment.\nOther Cost of Services\nOther costs of services include third-party processing costs directly attributable to processing and bank sponsorship costs, which may not be based on a percentage of volume. These costs also include related costs such as residual payments to sales groups, which are based on a percentage of the net revenues generated from merchant referrals. In certain merchant processing bank relationships the Company is liable for chargebacks against a merchant equal to the volume of the transaction. Losses resulting from chargebacks against a merchant are included in other cost of services on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company evaluates its risk for such transactions and estimates its potential loss from chargebacks based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. The reserve for merchant losses is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The cost of equipment sold is also included in other cost of services. Other costs of services are recognized at the time the associated revenue is earned.\nThe Company accounts for all governmental taxes associated with revenue transactions on a net basis.\nSelling General and Administrative\nSelling general and administrative include all personnel costs such as salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock based compensation and commissions, as well as marketing and advertising costs, contractor services, legal and other professional services fees, software and technological services, rental expenses and other general expenses.\nAdvertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $4,028, $2,623 and $1,813 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nEquity-based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for grants of equity awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. This standard requires compensation expense to be measured based on the estimated fair value of the share-based awards on the date of grant and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.\nEquity-based compensation was $26,230, $20,860 and $10,452 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration paid and identifiable assets acquired and assumed in acquisitions, goodwill and intangible asset impairment review, determination of performance obligations for revenue recognition, loss reserves, assumptions used in the calculation of equity-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes, and certain tax assets and liabilities as well as the related valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a $2,668 reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to the Companys investment in partnership and a corresponding reduction in the Company's income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. Management determined an additional portion of the deferred tax asset will be more likely than not realized based off an evaluation of the four sources of taxable income. See Note 11 for a discussion of the current period changes in valuation allowances.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company elected to make a policy change to allocate stock compensation expense to the holders of shares of Class B common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. This change resulted in a $235 reduction in the benefit from income taxes and a corresponding reduction in the Company's net loss, a $3,728 increase to the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest and a $3,493 decrease to the net loss attributable to i3 Verticals, Inc. for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. ASU 2020-06 also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As the Company is an emerging growth company and has elected to use the extended transition period afforded to such companies, the Company will not be required to adopt ASU 2020-06 until October 1, 2022. Effective October 1, 2022, the adoption of ASU 2020-06 will result in an increase in long-term debt, less current portion and debt issuance costs, net of $11,933, a decrease in additional paid-in-capital of $23,382 and a decrease in accumulated deficit of $11,449. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have no impact on net income.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\n3. CREDIT RISK AND OTHER CONCENTRATIONS\nThe Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions which provide Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions and does not expect any losses related to such concentrations.\nThe Companys revenues are earned by processing transactions for merchant businesses and other institutions under contract with the Company. The Company utilizes the funds settlement services of primarily seven processing banks, from which most accounts receivable are remitted monthly.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company believes that the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company uses third party payment processors, three of which facilitate more than 10% of our processing revenues for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n4. ACQUISITIONS\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company acquired the following intangible assets and businesses:\nResidual Buyouts\nFrom time to time, the Company acquires future commission streams from sales agents in exchange for an upfront cash payment. This results in an increase in overall gross processing volume to the Company. The residual buyouts are treated as asset acquisitions, resulting in recording a residual buyout intangible asset at cost on the date of acquisition. These assets are amortized using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be utilized over their estimated useful lives.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company purchased $52, $1,819 and $1,788, respectively, in residual buyouts using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. The acquired residual buyout intangible assets weighted average estimated amortization periods of eight years.\n2022 Business Combinations\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company completed the acquisitions of three businesses to expand the Companys software offerings in the Public Sector and Healthcare vertical markets. Certain of the purchase price allocations assigned for these acquisitions are considered preliminary as of September 30, 2022.\nTotal purchase consideration was $107,681, including $101,400 in cash consideration, funded by proceeds from the Company's revolving credit facility, and $6,281 of contingent consideration.\nThe goodwill associated with one of the three acquisitions is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired customer relationships intangible assets have estimated amortization periods of between ten and nineteen years. The trade names have estimated weighted-average amortization periods of four years. The weighted-average amortization period for all intangibles acquired is fifteen years.

The Company\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nreceived approximately $132,762 in net proceeds from the sale of the Exchangeable Notes, as determined by deducting estimated offering expenses paid to third-parties from the aggregate principal amount.\nThe Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on February 15, 2025, unless converted or repurchased at an earlier date.\ni3 Verticals, LLC issued the Exchangeable Notes pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of February 18, 2020 (the Indenture), among i3 Verticals, LLC, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.\nPrior to August 15, 2024, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods described in the Indenture, and thereafter, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable on the terms set forth in the Indenture into cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at i3 Verticals, LLCs election. The exchange rate is initially 24.4666 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $40.87 per share of Class A common stock). The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or i3 Verticals, LLCs delivery of a notice of redemption, i3 Verticals, LLC will increase, in certain circumstances, the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its Exchangeable Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be.\nIf the Company or i3 Verticals, LLC undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require i3 Verticals, LLC to repurchase all or part of their Exchangeable Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of September 30, 2022, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the Exchangeable Notes to early convert have been met.\ni3 Verticals, LLC may not redeem the Exchangeable Notes prior to February 20, 2023. On or after February 20, 2023, and prior to the 47th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the exchange price for the Exchangeable Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), i3 Verticals, LLC may redeem all or any portion of the Exchangeable Notes at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on such note to, but not including, the redemption date.\nThe Exchangeable Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of i3 Verticals, LLC and the guarantee is the Companys senior unsecured obligation and rank senior in right of payment to all of i3 Verticals, LLCs and the Companys future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Exchangeable Notes or the guarantee, as applicable. The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of i3 Verticals, LLCs and the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so expressly subordinated in the right of payment to the Exchangeable Notes or the guarantee, as applicable. The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee are effectively subordinated to any of the Companies existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness (including obligations under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility, defined below). The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and obligations (including the debt and trade payables) of the Companys subsidiaries, other than i3 Verticals, LLC.\nIn accounting for the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the Company separated the Exchangeable Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component before the allocation of any transaction costs was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated exchangeable feature. The carrying amount of the equity component (before the allocation of any transaction costs), representing the conversion option, which does not require separate accounting as a derivative as it meets\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\na scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Exchangeable Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes and the liability component represents the debt discount, which is recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheet and accreted over the period from the date of issuance to the contractual maturity date, resulting in the recognition of non-cash interest expense. The equity component of the Exchangeable Notes of approximately $28,662 is included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet and is not remeasured as longs as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. Transaction costs were allocated to the liability and equity components in the same proportion as the allocation of the proceeds. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as debt issuance costs in the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Exchangeable Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders' equity.\nThe Company incurred third-party issuance costs totaling $5,238, in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes for the year ended September 30, 2020. The Company capitalized $4,150 of debt issuance costs in connection with the Exchangeable Notes and allocated $1,088 of the third-party issuance costs to equity during the year ended September 30, 2020. Non-cash interest expense for amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Exchangeable Notes for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $666 and $588, respectively. The Company also wrote off a portion of the debt issuance costs in connection with the repurchase transactions in April and September 2020, as described below. Total unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Exchangeable Notes were $1,939 as of September 30, 2022.\nThe estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was $102,761 as of September 30, 2022. The estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was determined through consideration of quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 13.\nThe Company can choose to purchase its Exchangeable Notes on the open market. In April and September 2020, the Company paid $17,414 in aggregate to repurchase $21,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes and to repay approximately $24 in accrued interest on the repurchased portion of the Exchangeable Notes. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $2,297 due to the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the repurchased portion of the Exchangeable Notes at the dates of repurchases. The Company wrote off $592 of debt issuance costs in connection with the repurchase transactions.\nExchangeable Note Hedge Transactions\nOn February 12, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Exchangeable Notes, and on February 13, 2020, concurrently with the exercise by the initial purchasers of their right to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes, i3 Verticals, LLC entered into exchangeable note hedge transactions with respect to Class A common stock (the Note Hedge Transactions) with certain financial institutions (collectively, the Counterparties). The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Exchangeable Notes, the same number of shares of Class A common stock that initially underlie the Exchangeable Notes in the aggregate and are exercisable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes. The Note Hedge Transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon any exchange of the Exchangeable Notes. The Note Hedge Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the Exchangeable Notes, if not earlier exercised. The Note Hedge Transactions are separate transactions, entered into by i3 Verticals, LLC with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Exchangeable Notes. Holders of the Exchangeable Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedge Transactions. i3 Verticals, LLC used approximately $28,676 of the net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes (net of the premiums received for the warrant transactions described below) to pay the cost of the Note Hedge Transactions.\nThe Note Hedge Transactions do not require separate accounting as a derivative as they meet a scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity. The premiums paid for the Note Hedge Transactions have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nWarrant Transactions\nOn February 12, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Exchangeable Notes, and on February 13, 2020, concurrently with the exercise by the initial purchasers of their right to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes, the Company entered into warrant transactions to sell to the Counterparties warrants (the Warrants) to acquire, subject to customary adjustments, up to initially 3,376,391 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate at an initial exercise price of $62.88 per share. The Company offered and sold the Warrants in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Warrants will expire over a period beginning on May 15, 2025.\nThe Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Exchangeable Notes. Holders of the Exchangeable Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The Company received approximately $14,669 from the offering and sale of the Warrants. The Warrants do not require separate accounting as a derivative as they meet a scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity. The premiums paid for the Warrants have been included as a net increase to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn May 9, 2019, the Company replaced its then existing credit facility with a new credit agreement (the Senior Secured Credit Facility). As of September 30, 2022, the Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended, consisted of a $275,000 revolving credit facility, together with an option to increase the revolving credit facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an additional principal amount of up to $50,000 in the aggregate (subject to the receipt of additional commitments for any such incremental loan amounts). The Senior Secured Credit Facility accrues interest at Term SOFR (based upon an interest period of one, three or six months), plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 3.25% (3.25% as of September 30, 2022), or the base rate (defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) Term SOFR, plus an adjustment of 0.10%, plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.25% (1.25% as of September 30, 2022), in each case depending upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to pay unused commitment fees of 0.15% to 0.30% (0.30% as of September 30, 2022) on any undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees of up to 3.25% on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit issued under the agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires maintenance of certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis as follows: (i) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00, provided, that for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately following a qualified acquisition (each a Leverage Increase Period), the required ratio set forth above may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations and (iii) a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, provided, that for each Leverage Increase Period, the consolidated senior leverage ratio may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations. The maturity date of the Senior Secured Credit Facility is May 9, 2024. As of September 30, 2022, there was $89,983 available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, subject to the financial covenants.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company. The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility hold senior rights to collateral and principal repayment over all other creditors.\nThe provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility place certain restrictions and limitations upon the Company. These include, among others, restrictions on liens, investments, indebtedness, fundamental changes and dispositions; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and certain non-financial covenants pertaining to the activities of the Company during the period covered. The Company was in compliance with such covenants as of September 30, 2022. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility restricts the Company's ability to make dividends or other distributions to the holders of the Company's equity. The Company is permitted to (i) make cash distributions to the holders of the Company's equity in order to pay taxes incurred by owners of equity in i3 Verticals, LLC, by reason of such ownership, (ii) move intercompany cash between subsidiaries that are joined to\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nthe Senior Secured Credit Facility, (iii) repurchase equity from employees, directors, officers or consultants in an aggregate amount not to exceed $3,000 per year, (iv) make certain payments in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (v) make other dividends or distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the net cash proceeds received from any additional common equity issuance. The Company is also permitted to make non-cash dividends in the form of additional equity issuances. Each subsidiary may make ratable distributions to persons that own equity interests in such subsidiary. All other forms of dividends or distributions are prohibited under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nOn September 30, 2022, i3 Verticals, LLC entered into a LIBOR Transition Amendment (the LIBOR Amendment) with Bank of America, N.A and the other parties to the Credit Agreement. The LIBOR Amendment modified the Senior Secured Credit Agreement to reflect that the loans and other extensions of credit provided thereunder that incur interest, fees, commissions or other amounts based on the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), will no longer incur interest based on LIBOR but instead will incur interest based on the forward-looking SOFR term rate administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited (based upon an interest period of, at the borrowers election, one, three or six months). Except as set forth in the LIBOR Amendment, the other terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect. All other material terms included in the Credit Agreement, as amended, remain unchanged as a result of the execution of the LIBOR Amendment.\nOn October 3, 2022, i3 Verticals, LLC entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement, which increased the maximum amount of the revolving credit facility to $375,000. See Note 21 for a discussion of the Third Amendment.\nDebt issuance costs\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company capitalized $4,212 in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrants and in connection with entering into the second amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the related term of the debt using the effective interest rate method, and are presented net against long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not incur any additional issuance costs. The amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense and amounted to approximately $1,046, $968 and $758 during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n11.

Federal tax credits were $359, resulting in a deferred tax asset of $9,438 as of September 30, 2022 compared to $661 of federal tax credits, resulting in a deferred tax asset of $8,077 as of September 30, 2021. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and the federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2037. The use of federal net operating losses and credits are limited to the future taxable income of separate legal entities. As a result, a valuation allowance of $808 has been provided for certain federal deferred tax assets, an increase of $15 during the year ended September 30, 2022. State net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2022 totaled $108,992, resulting in a deferred tax asset of $6,913. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2026. The use of certain state net operating losses are limited to future taxable earnings of separate legal entities. As a result, a valuation allowance of $4,909 has been provided for state loss carryforwards, an increase of $880 during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company also considered a valuation allowance on its $56,388 outside basis of investment in i3 Verticals, LLC deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2022. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $21,838 against the portion of the deferred tax benefit that is capital in nature and against the amount not expected to be realized, resulting in an increase in valuation allowance of $6,391 during the year ended September 30, 2022. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation allowance.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe components of the Companys liability for uncertain tax benefits are as follows:\nGross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2020 $ 184\nIncrease in current year tax positions -\nIncrease in prior year tax positions -\nSettlements and other reductions 76\nGross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2021 108\nIncrease in current year tax positions -\nIncrease in prior year tax positions -\nSettlements and other reductions 25\nGross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2022 $ 83\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had accrued interest of no and no accrued penalties in either period related to uncertain tax positions. It is the Companys policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were unrecognized tax benefits of $83 and $108 that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nOn June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with i3 Verticals, LLC and each of the Continuing Equity Owners (the Tax Receivable Agreement) that provides for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that it actually realizes, or in some circumstances, is deemed to realize in its tax reporting, as a result of (i) future redemptions funded by the Company or exchanges, or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances, of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC for Class A common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. or cash, and (ii) certain additional tax benefits attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. These tax benefit payments are not conditioned upon one or more of the Continuing Equity Owners maintaining a continued ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. If a Continuing Equity Owner transfers Common Units but does not assign to the transferee of such units its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such Continuing Equity Owner generally will continue to be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising in respect of a subsequent exchange of such Common Units. In general, the Continuing Equity Owners rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement may not be assigned, sold, pledged or otherwise alienated to any person, other than certain permitted transferees, without (a) the Company's prior written consent, which should not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (b) such persons becoming a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement and agreeing to succeed to the applicable Continuing Equity Owners interest therein. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of the tax benefits, if any, that the Company may realize.\nWhen Class B common stock is exchanged for Class A common stock, this triggers an increase in the tax basis of the Company's Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,021,016 common units of i3 Verticals, LLC in connection with the redemption of common units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result of these exchanges, during the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized an increase to its net deferred tax assets in the amount of $6,307, and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of $5,361, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,671,479 common units of i3 Verticals, LLC in connection with the redemption of common units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result of these exchanges, during the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized an increase to\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nits net deferred tax assets in the amount of $13,990, and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of $11,892, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company acquired an aggregate of 111,000 common units of i3 Verticals, LLC in connection with the redemption of common units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result of these exchanges, during the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized an increase to its net deferred tax assets in the amount of $898, and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of $763, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners.\nThe deferred tax asset and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liability balances were $40,981 and $40,832, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.\nPayments to the Continuing Equity Owners related to exchanges through September 30, 2022 will range from $0 to $3,315 per year and are expected to be paid over the next 26 years. The amounts recorded as of September 30, 2022, approximate the current estimate of expected tax savings and are subject to change after the filing of the Companys U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement with respect to subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts.\n12. LEASES\nAs discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted ASC 842 effective October 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective transition method, under which the prior period financial statements were not restated for the new guidance.\nThe Companys leases consist primarily of real estate leases throughout the markets in which the Company operates. At contract inception, the Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, and for each identified lease, evaluates the classification as operating or financing. The Company had no finance leases as of September 30, 2022. Leased assets and obligations are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of fixed lease payments to be made over the term of the lease. Renewal and termination options are factored into determination of the lease term only if the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. The weighted-average remaining lease term at September 30, 2022 was five years. The Company had no significant short-term leases during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe Companys leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit interest rate and the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. The incremental borrowing rates were determined based on a portfolio approach considering the Companys current secured borrowing rate adjusted for market conditions and the length of the lease term. The weighted-average discount rate used in the measurement of our lease liabilities was 6.4% as of September 30, 2022.\nOperating lease cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating lease costs for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $5,815 and $4,096, respectively, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nTotal operating lease costs for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, include variable lease costs of approximately $59 and $6, respectively, which are primarily comprised of costs of maintenance and utilities and changes in rates, and are determined based on the actual costs incurred during the period. Variable payments are expensed in the period incurred and not included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities.\nShort-term rent expense for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $177 and $304, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nAs of September 30, 2022, maturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nYears ending September 30:\n2023 $ 5,492\n2024 4,703\n2025 4,095\n2026 3,344\n2027 1,521\nThereafter 2,011\nTotal future minimum lease payments (undiscounted)(1)\n21,166\nLess: present value discount (2,604)\nPresent value of lease liability $ 18,562\n_________________________\n1.Total future minimum lease payments excludes payments of $26 for leases designated as short-term leases, which are excluded from the Company's right-of-use assets. These payments will be made within the next twelve months.\n13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability as of the measurement date. A three-tier, fair-value reporting hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements based on the observability of the inputs to the valuation of financial assets and liabilities. The three levels are:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.\nLevel 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable in active exchange markets.\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, settlement assets and obligations, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximated their fair values as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, because of the relatively short maturity dates on these instruments. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, because interest rates on these instruments approximate market interest rates.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe Company has no Level 1 or Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables present the changes in the Company's Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nAccrued Contingent Consideration\nBalance at September 30, 2020 $ 13,034\nContingent consideration accrued at time of business combination 22,577\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration included in Operating expenses 7,140\nContingent consideration paid (6,522)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 $ 36,229\nContingent consideration accrued at time of business combination 6,281\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration included in Operating expenses 23,725\nContingent consideration paid (43,402)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 22,833\nThe fair value of contingent consideration obligations includes inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The amount to be paid under these obligations is contingent upon the achievement of certain growth metrics related to the financial performance of the entities subsequent to acquisition. The fair value of material contingent consideration included in an acquisition is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The contingent consideration is revalued each period until it is settled. Management reviews the historical and projected performance of each acquisition with contingent consideration and uses an income probability method to revalue the contingent consideration. The revaluation requires management to make certain assumptions and represent management's best estimate at the valuation date. The probabilities are determined based on a management review of the expected likelihood of triggering events that would cause a change in the contingent consideration paid. The Company develops the projected future financial results based on an analysis of historical results, market conditions, and the expected impact of anticipated changes in the Company's overall business and/or product strategies.\nApproximately $21,385 and $25,768 of contingent consideration was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Approximately $1,448 and $10,461 of contingent consideration was recorded in other long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDisclosure of Fair Values\nThe Company's financial instruments that are not remeasured at fair value include the Exchangeable Notes (see Note 10). The Company estimates the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes through consideration of quoted market prices of similar instruments, classified as Level 2 as described above. The estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was $102,761 as of September 30, 2022.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\n14. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\nA summary of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nStock options $ 25,163 $ 20,860 $ 10,452\nRestricted stock units 1,067 - -\nEquity-based compensation expense $ 26,230 $ 20,860 $ 10,452\nAmounts are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Income tax benefits of $468, $1,083 and $604 were recognized related to equity-based compensation during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock Options\nIn May 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan) under which the Company may grant up to 3,500,000 stock options and other equity-based awards to employees, directors and officers. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan includes an annual increase on the first day of each year, beginning with the 2019 calendar year, equal to 4.0% of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year, unless the Companys board of directors determines prior to the last trading day of December of the immediately preceding calendar year that the increase shall be less than 4%. As of September 30, 2022, there were 834,807 options available to grant under the 2018 Plan.\nIn September 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Acquisition Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Inducement Plan) under which the Company may grant up to 1,500,000 stock options and other equity-based awards to individuals that were not previously employees of the Company or its subsidiaries in connection with acquisitions, as a material inducement to the individual's entry into employment with the Company or its subsidiaries within the meaning of Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. In May 2021, the Company amended the 2020 Inducement Plan to increase the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock available for issuance from 1,500,000 to 3,000,000 shares. As of September 30, 2022, there were 992,848 equity awards available for grant under the 2020 Inducement Plan.\nShare-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates.\nThe Company has issues stock option awards under the 2018 Plan and the 2020 Inducement Plan. The fair value of the stock option awards during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following weighted-average assumptions:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nExpected volatility(1)\n55.7 % 59.7 %\nExpected dividend yield(2)\n- % - %\nExpected term(3)\n6 years 6 years\nRisk-free interest rate(4)\n1.6 % 0.7 %\n_________________\n1.For the year ended September 30, 2022, expected volatility is based on the volatility of the Company's own share price. For the year ended September 30, 2021, expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a selected peer group over a period equivalent to the expected term.\n2.The Company has assumed a dividend yield of zero as management has no plans to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\n3.Expected term represents the estimated period of time until an award is exercised and was determined using the simplified method as details of employee exercise behavior are limited due to limited historical data.\n4.The risk-free rate is an interpolation of yields on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equivalent to the expected term.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nA summary of stock option activity for the year ended September 30, 2022 is as follows:\nStock Options Weighted Average Exercise Price\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 7,547,622 $ 25.26\nGranted 1,672,808 24.50\nExercised (343,865) 17.08\nForfeited (654,243) 30.05\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 8,222,322 $ 25.07\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 4,479,276 $ 23.09\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $12.92.\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were 8,222,322 stock options outstanding, of which 4,479,276 were exercisable. As of September 30, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, including an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, was $33,562, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The Company's policy is to account for forfeitures of stock-based compensation awards as they occur.\nThe total fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $24,586.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company has issued Class A common stock in the form of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") under the 2018 Plan.\nA summary of activity related to restricted stock units as of September 30, 2022 is as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units Weighted Average Exercise Price\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 - $ -\nGranted 504,903 24.99\nVested - -\nForfeited (18,251) 26.53\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 486,652 $ 24.93\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $24.99.\nAs of September 30, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs, including an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, was $6,187, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.6 years.\nThere were no RSUs that vested during the year ended September 30, 2022.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\n15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases\nThe Company utilizes office space and equipment under operating leases. Rent expense under these leases amounted to $5,992, $4,400 and $2,820 during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion and a table of the future minimum payments under these leases.\nMinimum Processing Commitments\nThe Company has non-exclusive agreements with several processors to provide The Company services related to transaction processing and transmittal, transaction authorization and data capture, and access to various reporting tools. Certain of these agreements require the Company to submit a minimum monthly number of transactions for processing. If the Company submits a number of transactions that is lower than the minimum, it is required to pay to the processor the fees it would have received if the Company had submitted the required minimum number of transactions. As of September 30, 2022, such minimum fee commitments were as follows:\nYears ending September 30:\n2023 $ 4,512\n2024 1,230\n2025 90\n2026 -\n2027 -\nThereafter -\nTotal $ 5,832\nThird Party Sales Organization Buyout Agreement\nThe Company has conditionally committed to a future buyout of a third party's business at the earlier of (a) the 60th day following the date upon which the founder of the third party sales organization dies or becomes disabled or (b) the 60th day following July 1, 2023. The buyout amount is dependent on certain financial metrics but is capped at $29,000, which would be net of repayment of secured loans. The buyout also contains certain provisions to provide additional consideration of up to $9,000, in the aggregate, to be paid based on the achievement of specified financial performance targets, following the buyout. As the eventual financial metrics are not known, the amount of the buyout transaction as well as the additional consideration are not able to be estimated at this time.\nLitigation\nWith respect to all legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings, and in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies-Loss Contingencies, the Company considers the likelihood of a negative outcome. If the Company determines the likelihood of a negative outcome with respect to any such matter is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an accrual for the estimated amount of loss for the expected outcome of the matter. If the likelihood of a negative outcome with respect to material matters is reasonably possible and the Company is able to determine an estimate of the amount of possible loss or a range of loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Company discloses the estimate of the amount of possible loss or range of loss. However, the Company in some instances may be unable to estimate an amount of possible loss or range of loss based on the significant uncertainties involved in, or the preliminary nature of, the matter, and in these instances the Company will disclose the nature of the contingency and describe why the Company is unable to determine an estimate of possible loss or range of loss.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe Company is involved in ordinary course legal proceedings, which include all claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including unasserted claims, which are probable of being asserted, arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company has considered all such ordinary course legal proceedings in formulating its disclosures and assessments. After taking into consideration the evaluation of such legal matters by the Company's legal counsel, the Company's management believes at this time such matters will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows.\nS&S Litigation\nOn June 2, 2021, the State of Louisiana, Division of Administration (the State) and a putative class of Louisiana law enforcement districts filed a Petition (as amended on October 4, 2021, the Petition), in the 19th Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge against i3-Software & Services, LLC (S&S), a subsidiary of the Company located in Shreveport, Louisiana, the Company, i3 Verticals, LLC, the current leader of the S&S business, the former leader of the S&S business, and 1120 South Pointe Properties, LLC (South Pointe), the former owner of the assets of the S&S business. See State of Louisiana, by and through its Division of Administration, East Baton Rouge Parish Law Enforcement District, by and through the duly elected East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff, Sid J. Gautreaux, III, et. al., individually and as class representatives vs. i3-Software & Services, LLC; 1120 South Pointe Properties, LLC, formerly known as Software and Services of Louisiana, L.L.C.; i3 Verticals, Inc.; i3 Verticals, LLC; Gregory R. Teeters; and Scott Carrington.\nThe Petition was amended on October 4, 2021 to add a putative class of Louisiana sheriffs (the Sheriffs) and subsequently removed to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The Petition seeks monetary damages for the cost of network remediation of $15,000 purportedly spent by the State and $7,000 purportedly spent by the Sheriffs, return of purchase prices, potential additional expenses related to remediation and any obligation to notify parties of an alleged data breach as and if required by applicable law, and reasonable attorneys fees. The claimed damages relate to a third-party remote access software product used in connection with services provided by S&S to certain Louisiana Parish law enforcement districts and alleged inadequacies in the Companys cybersecurity practices. Plaintiffs moved to remand the action to state court on November 5, 2021, and the motion was referred to a magistrate to make a report and recommendation to the district court judge. On July 5, 2022 the magistrate recommended that the matter be remanded to state court. On July 19, 2022 the Company and all other defendants filed objections to the recommendation. On August 3, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed a response to those objections. On August 16, 2022, the district court granted the Plaintiffs motion to remand, and all Defendants appealed, filling their opening appellant brief on October 28, 2022. The Plaintiffs appellee brief is due November 28, 2022.\nThe assets of the S&S business were acquired from South Pointe by the Company in 2018 for $17,000, including upfront cash consideration and contingent consideration, and provides software and payments services within the Companys Public Sector vertical to local government agencies almost exclusively in Louisiana.\nThe Company is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation. While we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, we cannot give assurance that this matter will not have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which it is resolved.\nOther\nThe Company's subsidiary CP-PS, LLC has certain indemnification obligations in favor of FDS Holdings, Inc. related to the acquisition of certain assets of Merchant Processing Solutions, LLC in February 2014. The Company has incurred expenses related to these indemnification obligations in prior periods and may have additional expenses in the future. However, after taking into consideration the evaluation of such matters by the Companys legal counsel, the Companys management believes at this time that the anticipated outcome of any existing or potential indemnification liabilities related to this matter will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\n16. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn connection with the Company's IPO, the Company and i3 Verticals, LLC entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Continuing Equity Owners that provides for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that it actually realizes, or in some circumstances, is deemed to realize in its tax reporting, as a result of (i) future redemptions funded by the Company or exchanges, or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances, of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC for Class A common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. or cash, and (ii) certain additional tax benefits attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See Note 11 for further information. As of September 30, 2022, the total amount due under the Tax Receivable Agreement was $40,832.\nIn April 2016, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to purchase certain assets of Axia, LLC. On April 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Processing Services Agreement (the AxiaMed Agreement) with Axia Technologies, LLC (which has since been incorporated as Axia Technologies, Inc., doing business as AxiaMed (AxiaMed)), an entity controlled by the previous owner of Axia, LLC. Under the AxiaMed Agreement, the Company agreed to provide processing services for certain merchants as designated by AxiaMed from time to time. In accordance with ASC 606-10-55, revenue from the processing services is recognized net of interchange, residual expense and other fees.\nIn March 2021, the Company became aware of an observable price change in the AxiaMed equity investment, due to a planned third party acquisition of AxiaMed. This resulted in an increase of $2,353 to the fair value of the AxiaMed investment at March 31, 2021, which the Company recognized in other income. On April 1, 2021, AxiaMed was sold to a third party and the Company received $2,453 for its investment in AxiaMed. Greg Daily, the Companys chief executive officer; Clay Whitson, the Companys chief financial officer; and the Company no longer have ownership interest in AxiaMed following the sale. The Company earned net revenues related to the AxiaMed Agreement of $117 and $95 during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\n17. SEGMENTS\nThe Company determines its operating segments based on ASC 280, Segment Reporting, in alignment with how the chief operating decision making group monitors and manages the performance of the business as well as the level at which financial information is reviewed. The Companys operating segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.\nThe Company's core business is delivering seamlessly integrated payment and software solutions to customers in strategic vertical markets. This is accomplished through the Merchant Services and Software and Services (formerly known as Proprietary Software and Payments) segments.\nThe Merchant Services segment provides comprehensive payment solutions to businesses and organizations.

NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\ni3 Verticals, Inc. is the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC and as a result, consolidates the financial results of i3 Verticals, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners. Changes in i3 Verticals, Inc.s ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC while i3 Verticals, Inc. retains its controlling interest in i3 Verticals, LLC will be accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC by the Continuing Equity Owners will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in capital when i3 Verticals, LLC has positive or negative net assets, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively, i3 Verticals, Inc. owned 22,986,448 and 22,026,098 of i3 Verticals, LLC's Common Units, representing a 69.4% and 68.3% economic ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes the impact on equity due to changes in the Company's ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC:\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest $ (6,115) $ (3,382) $ (560)\nTransfers to (from) non-controlling interests:\nDistributions to non-controlling interest holders - - (3)\nRedemption of common units in i3 Verticals, LLC (918) (11,714) (5,080)\nAdjustment related to prior periods - - 2,730\nCumulative effect of adoption of new accounting standard - - 640\nAllocation of equity to non-controlling interests 11,511 15,337 24,495\nNet transfers to (from) non-controlling interests 10,593 3,623 22,782\nChange from net income attributable to non-controlling interests and transfers to (from) non-controlling interests $ 4,478 $ 241 $ 22,222\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company corrected for immaterial misstatements of equity between the Company and non-controlling interest related to its June 2019 Secondary Public Offering by increasing non-controlling interest and reducing additional paid-in capital. This adjustment related to immaterial errors associated with the ownership percentage change used in the underlying calculation giving effect to the offering.\n19. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to i3 Verticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to i3 Verticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities.\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nThe following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nBasic net loss per share:\nNumerator\nNet loss\n$ (23,217) $ (7,839) $ (979)\nLess: Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n(6,115) (3,382) (560)\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders\n$ (17,102) $ (4,457) $ (419)\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding(1)\n22,249,656 20,994,598 14,833,378\nBasic net loss per share(2)\n$ (0.77) $ (0.21) $ (0.03)\nDilutive net loss per share(4):\nNumerator\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders\n$ (4,457) $ (419)\nReallocation of net loss assuming conversion of common units(5)\n(2,556) (422)\nNet loss attributable to Class A common stockholders - diluted\n$ (7,013) $ (841)\nDenominator\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding(1)\n20,994,598 14,833,378\nWeighted average effect of dilutive securities(2)(3)\n10,719,593 12,596,423\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding - diluted\n31,714,191 27,429,801\nDiluted net loss per share\n$ (0.22) $ (0.03)\n____________________\n1.Excludes 6,706 and 204,969 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n2.For the year ended September 30, 2020, the following securities were excluded from the weighted average effect of dilutive securities in the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:\na.1,327,500 options to purchase shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020, were excluded because the exercise price of these options exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock during the period (out-of-the-money) and the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive, and\nb.1,179,538 shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020, resulting from estimated stock option exercises as calculated by the treasury stock method, and 204,969 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020 were excluded because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.\n3.For the year ended September 30, 2021, the following securities were excluded from the weighted average effect of dilutive securities in the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:\na.2,495,922 options to purchase shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2021, were excluded because the exercise price of these options exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock during the period (out-of-the-money) and the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive, and\nb.1,471,027 shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2021, resulting from estimated stock option exercises as calculated by the treasury stock method, and 6,706 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2021 were excluded because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.\n4.For the year ended September 30, 2022, all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive, so diluted net loss per share was equivalent to basic net loss per share. The following securities were excluded from the weighted average effect of dilutive securities in the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:\na.10,170,668 shares of weighted average Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2022, along with the reallocation of net income assuming conversion of these shares, were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive,\nb.4,580,844 options to purchase shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2022, were excluded because the exercise price of these options exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock during the period (out-of-the-money) and the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive, and\ni3 VERTICALS, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except unit, share and per share amounts)\nc.679,858 shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2022, resulting from estimated stock option exercises as calculated by the treasury stock method were excluded because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.\n5.The reallocation of net income assuming conversion of common units represents the tax effected net income attributable to non-controlling interest using the effective income tax rates described in Note 11 above and assuming all common units of i3 Verticals, LLC were exchanged for Class A common stock at the beginning of the year. The common units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners are potentially dilutive securities, and the computations of pro forma diluted net income per share assume that all common units of i3 Verticals, LLC were exchanged for shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the year.\nSince in September 2022 the Company made the irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of its Exchangeable Notes only in cash, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company's Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the exchange price of $40.87 per share for the Exchangeable Notes.\nThe Warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes are considered to be dilutive when the average price of the Company's Class A common stock during the period exceeds the Warrants' stock price of $62.88 per share. The effect of the additional shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Warrants will be included in the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding-diluted using the treasury stock method. The Note Hedge Transactions purchased in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes are considered to be anti-dilutive and therefore do not impact our calculation of diluted net income per share. Refer to Note 10 for further discussion regarding the Exchangeable Notes.\nShares of the Company's Class B common stock do not participate in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.\n20. SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS\nThe Company engaged in the following significant non-cash investing and financing activities during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nRestricted Class A common stock issued as part of acquisition purchase consideration (Note 4) $ - $ 35,245 $ -\nAcquisition date fair value of contingent consideration in connection with business combinations $ 6,281 $ 22,577 $ 4,748\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations $ 7,846 $ 16,879 $ -\n21.

Based on such evaluations, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective (at the reasonable assurance level) to ensure that the information required to be included in this report has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and to ensure that the information required to be included in this report was accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report from our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit emerging growth companies, which we are, to provide only management's report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 that materially affected, or which are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
