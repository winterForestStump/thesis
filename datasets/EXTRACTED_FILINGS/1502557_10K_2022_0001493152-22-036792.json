    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nRegulatory Overview - Legal and Operational Risks\nKun Peng International Ltd. (KPIL) is not a Chinese operating company but rather a Nevada holding company with operations in the PRC conducted by our PRC subsidiary (King Eagle (China) Co., Ltd.) through contractual agreements with a variable interest entity (VIE) (King Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd.), as discussed in greater detail below, which structure involves unique risks to shareholders and investors including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications, and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, our operations and business in the PRC are conducted through contractual arrangements (VIE Agreements) with King Eagle VIE which give us effective control over and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from these business operations.\n\u25cf Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and the King Eagle VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect and that the VIE Agreements are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect, but have not been tested in court, KPIL faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect the enforceability of the VIE Agreements, King Eagle VIEs financial performance, and the value of a shareholders KPIL shares.\n\u25cf Although the PRCs Ministry of Commerce and its National Development and Reform Commission have announced new edicts regarding the use of VIEs for new overseas offerings, they have indicated that such new requirements will not affect the foreign ownership of companies already listed overseas. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that such new rules and regulations will not be applied retroactively which may have a substantial impact on KPILs business and consequently on the value of KPILs securities.\n\u25cf Shareholders do not have a direct equity ownership interest in King Eagle VIE but control and receive the economic benefits of its business operations in China through the VIE Agreements. Therefore, should the Chinese government disallow or limit the use of the VIE, it could result in your shares significantly declining in value or becoming worthless.\n\u25cf Because all of our operations are conducted in the PRC through our wholly owned subsidiary the Chinese government may exercise significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of your shares.\n\u25cf Regulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection and more stringent laws and regulations may be introduced in China. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. However, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux, and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data, and there can be no assurance that in the future our operations may not be subject to these regulations which could have a significant material impact on our financial performance and the value of our securities.\n\u25cf KPILs PRC subsidiarys ability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable earnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to its shareholders only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. This reserve is not distributable as cash dividends.\n\u25cf To address persistent capital outflows and the RMBs depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the Peoples Bank of China, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments, and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiarys dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments.\n\u25cf\u202f In addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC subsidiary.\nPlease see ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include risk factors in this report. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on the Company and its operations:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Companys ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan.\nThe audited consolidated financial statements of KPIL included in this report include a paragraph that indicates that they were prepared assuming that we would continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2022, the Company incurred cash outflows from operating activities of $1,592,130, a net loss of $1,972,841, and negative working capital of $4,254,598. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. In order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of consumer health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting its own brand of preventive health care related products on its new online platform to reduce its costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors. Management may seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity securities for cash or loans from our officers and controlling stockholders, to operate our business and estimates that additional capital will be necessary to support our operations and growth.\nWe may continue to incur losses in the future, and may not be able to return to profitability, which may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nKPIL incurred a net loss of $1,972,841 and $1,774,734, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have generated very limited revenue. Our current operations are small with a short history. We may be unable to achieve our performance targets, which will impact the Companys operating results. Our ability to achieve profitability depends on the competitiveness of our products and services as well as our ability to control costs and to provide new products and services to meet the market demands and attract new customers. Due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our business, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve profitability in the short-term or long-term. The Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting its own brand of preventive health care related products on its new online platform to reduce its costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors. Management may seek additional funds, primarily through the issuance of equity securities for cash and loans from our officers and controlling stockholders, to operate our business and estimates that additional capital will be necessary to support our operations and growth.\nWe have a limited operating history and face many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by development stage companies.\nOur operating entity and our VIE, King Eagle (China) and King Eagle VIE, commenced their operations in June 2020 and September 2020, respectively. As a result of our limited operating history, our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or changed due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks and uncertainties successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe market for health care and household products and services is fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for certain applications and services. Some of our competitors may enjoy better competitive positions in certain geographic regions or user demographics that we currently serve or may serve in the future. We expect competition in the online personal products business to continue to increase because there are no substantial barriers to entry. We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf the size and diversity of our member and paying subscriber bases;\n\u25cf the timing and market acceptance of our apps, including the developments and enhancements to those apps and features relative to those offered by our competitors;\n\u25cf customer service and support efforts;\n\u25cf selling and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf our brand strength in the marketplace relative to our competitors.\nWe compete with traditional health care and household product retailers. We also compete with a number of large and small companies, including internet portals and specialty-focused media companies, that provide online and offline products and services to the markets we serve. Our principal mobile-based social e-commerce competitors include Pinduoduo (based on the group buying model), Weimeng (providing services for micro-businesses), Taobao, and JD. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources, and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer preferences. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies that may allow them to build larger member and paying subscriber bases than ours. Our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. These activities could attract members and paying subscribers away from our websites and reduce our market share.\nIn addition, current and potential competitors are making, and are expected to continue to make, strategic acquisitions or are establishing cooperatives and, in some cases, establishing exclusive relationships with significant companies or competitors to expand their businesses or to offer more comprehensive products and services. To the extent that these competitors or potential competitors establish exclusive relationships with major portals, search engines, and Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, our ability to reach potential members through online advertising may be restricted. Any of these competitors could cause us difficulty in attracting and retaining members and in converting members into paying subscribers and could jeopardize our existing affiliate program and relationships with portals, search engines, ISPs, and other online properties.\nIf we fail to stay current with new technologies and trends in social e-commerce platforms and preventive health care and household products and services, our applications could become obsolete.\nWe incur compensation costs for our internal technology support team not only for the creation of new applications, but also for ensuring that our current applications will be compatible with new technologies. If our technology support team fails to upgrade our applications to stay current with new technologies or to add new features that are popular for preventative healthcare and household uses, our applications could become obsolete, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on key personnel, and turnover of key employees and senior management could harm our business.\nOur future business and results of operations depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our management, marketing, and technical personnel. They also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management, technical, marketing, and sales and support personnel for our operations. As China is building its powerful technology industry and enhancing its market-oriented economic system, competition for talent becomes increasingly fierce. Many of our potential competitors have greater financial, personnel, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do. If we lose a key employee or if a key employee fails to perform in his or her current position, or if we are not able to attract and retain skilled employees as needed, our business could suffer. We depend on the skills and abilities of these key employees in managing the technical, marketing, and sales aspects of our business, any part of which could be harmed by significant turnover.\nWe may not be able to manage the expansion of our operations effectively.\nWe are in the process of developing our business in order to meet the potentially increasing demand for our products, as well as to capture new market opportunities. Our current business operations are small with a short history. We may be unable to achieve our performance targets, which will impact our operating results. As we continue to grow, we must continue to improve our operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls, increase service capacity and output, and expand, train, and manage our growing employee base. In order to fund our ongoing operations and our future growth, we need to have sufficient internal sources of liquidity or access to additional financing from external sources. Furthermore, our management will be required to maintain and strengthen our relationships with our customers and other third parties. Currently, we only have 26 full time employees. As a result, our continued expansion has placed, and will continue to place, significant strains on our management personnel, systems, and resources. We also will need to further strengthen our internal control and compliance functions to ensure that we will be able to comply with our legal and contractual obligations and minimize our operational and compliance risks. Our current and planned operations, personnel, systems, internal procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future growth. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute our business strategies, or respond to competitive pressures.\nThe spread of COVID-19 may cause delays or limit our ability to expand our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings, and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world. Due to restrictions, quarantines and closures in certain affected areas and government agencies in the PRC, the approval process of our applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and construction projects of Smart Kiosks were therefore postponed.\nBusinesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel or launch face-to-face marketing activities. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the Companys average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 34.4%, from $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nTherefore, we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of global situation of COVID-19. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.\nOur holding company structure may limit the payment of dividends.\nWe have no direct business operations, other than our ownership of our subsidiaries. While we have no current intention of paying dividends, should we decide in the future to do so, as a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and meet our other obligations depends upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our PRC subsidiaries and other holdings and investments. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries, from time to time, may be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us, including as a result of restrictive covenants in loan agreements, restrictions on the conversion of local currency into U.S. dollars or other hard currency, and other regulatory restrictions as discussed below. If future dividends are paid in RMB, fluctuations in the exchange rate for the conversion of RMB into U.S. dollars may reduce the amount received by U.S. stockholders upon conversion of the dividend payment into U.S. dollars.\nChinese regulations currently permit the payment of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Our subsidiaries in China are also required to set aside a portion of their after-tax profits according to Chinese accounting standards and regulations to fund certain reserve funds. Currently, our subsidiaries in China are the only sources of revenue or investment holdings for the payment of dividends. If they do not accumulate sufficient profits under Chinese accounting standards and regulations to first fund certain reserve funds as required by Chinese accounting standards, we will be unable to pay any dividends.\nAfter-tax profits/losses with respect to the payment of dividends out of accumulated profits and the annual appropriation of after-tax profits as calculated pursuant to PRC accounting standards and regulations do not result in significant differences as compared to after-tax earnings as presented in our financial statements. However, there are certain differences between PRC accounting standards and regulations and U.S. GAAP, arising from different treatment of items such as amortization of intangible assets and change in fair value of contingent consideration rising from business combinations.\nRisks Relating to our Commercial Relationship with our VIE\nPRC laws and regulations governing our business and the validity of certain of our contractual arrangements are uncertain. If we are found to be in violation of such PRC laws and regulations, our business may be negatively affected, and we may be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.\nPRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that operate Internet information and content, value added telecommunications, and certain other businesses in which we are engaged or could be deemed to be engaged. Consequently, we conduct certain of our operations and businesses in the PRC through our VIE. Our VIE Agreements give us effective control over King Eagle VIE and enable us to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits arising from it as well as consolidate its financial results in our results of operations. Although the structure we have adopted is commonly adopted by comparable companies in China, the PRC government may not agree that these arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration, or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies, or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future.\nKPIL, KP International Holding, and KP Industrial are considered foreign investors or foreign invested enterprises under PRC law. As a result, KPIL, KP International Holding, and KP Industrial are subject to certain limitations under PRC law on foreign ownership of Chinese companies. These laws and regulations are relatively new and may be subject to change, and their official interpretation and enforcement may involve substantial uncertainty. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations, or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.\nWe have been advised by our PRC counsel that the ownership structures of our PRC subsidiary and our VIE in China do not violate any applicable PRC law, regulation, or rule currently in effect; and that the contractual arrangements between King Eagle (China), King Eagle VIE, and its equity holders governed by PRC law are valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, our PRC counsel has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current PRC laws, rules, and regulations. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities and PRC courts may in the future take a view that is contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.\nThe PRC government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business and other licenses, and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to us by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new PRC laws or regulations on our business. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found in violation of any current or future PRC laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. If the imposition of any of these government actions causes us to lose our right to direct the activities of our VIE or to otherwise separate from them and if we are not able to restructure our ownership structure and operations in a satisfactory manner, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of our VIE in our consolidated financial statements. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur arrangements with our VIE and its shareholders may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities. Any adjustment of related party transaction pricing could lead to additional taxes, and therefore could have an adverse effect on our income and expenses.\nThe tax regime in China is rapidly evolving and there is significant uncertainty for taxpayers in China as PRC tax laws may be interpreted in significantly different ways. The PRC tax authorities may assert that we or our subsidiaries or VIE, or its equity holders, owe and/or are required to pay additional taxes on previous or future revenue or income. In particular, under applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties, such as the contractual arrangements with our VIE, may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that our agreements with our VIE and its shareholders were not entered into based on arms length negotiations. As a result, they may adjust our income and expenses for PRC tax purposes in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. Such an adjustment may require that we pay additional PRC taxes plus applicable penalties and interest, if any.\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be substantially affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress promulgated the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. Since it is relatively new, substantial uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements as foreign invested enterprises even if they are ultimately controlled by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign investment that includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations, or the State Council. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, at which time it will be uncertain whether our contractual arrangements will be deemed to be in violation of the market access requirements for foreign investment in the PRC, and if they are deemed to be in violation, how our contractual arrangements should be dealt with.\nThe Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries specified as either restricted or prohibited from foreign investment in the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access jointly promulgated by MOFCOM and the NDRC that took effect in July 2020. The Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. If our control over our VIE through contractual arrangements is deemed to be foreign investment in the future, and if any business of our VIE is restricted or prohibited from foreign investment under the negative list effective at the time, we may be deemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over our VIE may be deemed to be invalid and illegal, and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and/or restructure our business operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations, or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations.\nOur contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing control over our variable interest entity as direct ownership.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our VIE to operate our electronic platform in China and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited. These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our VIE.\nIf we had direct ownership of the VIE, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes in the Board of Directors of the entity, which could effect changes at the management and operational level. Under our contractual arrangements, we would be able to change the members of the Board of Directors of the entity exclusively by influencing the equity holders votes, and we would have to rely on the variable interest entity and the variable interest entity equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements in order to exercise our control over the variable interest entity. The variable interest entity equity holders may have conflicts of interest with us or our shareholders, and they may not act in the best interests of our Company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. For example, our VIE and its equity holders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct their operations, including maintaining our website and using our domain names and trademarks, which the variable interest entity has the exclusive right to use, in an acceptable manner, or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. Pursuant to the call option, we may replace the equity holders of the VIE at any time pursuant to the contractual arrangements. However, if any equity holder is uncooperative and any dispute relating to these contracts or to the replacement of the equity holder were to remain unresolved, we would have to enforce our rights under the contractual arrangements through the operation of PRC law and arbitral or judicial agencies, which may be costly and time-consuming and would be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Consequently, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in ensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations.\nAny failure by our VIE or its equity holders to perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our VIE or its equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. Although we have entered into an option agreement in relation to our variable interest entity, which provides that we may exercise an option to acquire, or nominate a person to acquire, ownership of the equity in that entity or, in some cases, its assets, to the extent permitted by applicable PRC laws, rules, and regulations, the exercise of the option is subject to the review and approval of the relevant PRC governmental authorities. We have also entered into an equity interest pledge agreement with respect to the variable interest entity to secure certain obligations of such VIE or its equity holders to us under the contractual arrangements. However, the enforcement of such agreement through arbitral or judicial agencies may be costly and time-consuming and would be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Moreover, our remedies under the equity pledge agreement are primarily intended to help us collect debts owed to us by the variable interest entity equity holders under the contractual arrangements and may not help us in acquiring the assets or equity of the variable interest entity.\nThe contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration or court proceedings in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. Moreover, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC law, and as a result it may be difficult to predict how an arbitration panel or court would view such contractual arrangements. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the contractual arrangements. Under PRC law, if the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards or court judgments within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards or court judgments in PRC courts, which would require additional expense and delay. In the event we are unable to enforce the contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over our variable interest entity, and our ability to conduct our business, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in international trade or investment policies and barriers to trade or investment and the ongoing geopolitical conflict may have an adverse effect on our business and expansion plans and could lead to the delisting of our securities from U.S. exchanges and/or other restrictions or prohibitions on investing in our securities.\nIn recent years, international market conditions and the international regulatory environment have been increasingly affected by competition among countries and geopolitical frictions. In particular, the U.S. administration has advocated for and taken steps toward restricting trade in certain goods, particularly from China. From 2018 to late 2019, the United States announced several tariff increases that applied to products imported from China, totaling over US$550 billion. By the end of 2019, the two countries had reached a phase one trade deal to roll back tariffs and suspend certain tariff increases by the United States that were scheduled to take effect from December 2019, and in January 2020, the two sides entered into a formal phase one agreement on trade. The progress of trade talks between China and the United States is subject to uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to whether the United States will maintain or reduce tariffs or impose additional tariffs on Chinese products in the near future. Furthermore, in August 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department labelled China as a currency manipulator, which label was officially dropped by the U.S. Treasury Department in January 2020. However, it is uncertain whether the U.S. government may issue any similar announcements in the future. As a result of such announcement, the United States may take further actions to eliminate perceived unfair competitive advantages created by alleged manipulating actions. Changes to national trade or investment policies, treaties and tariffs, fluctuations in exchange rates, or the perception that these changes could occur could adversely affect the financial and economic conditions in China, as well as our future international and cross-border operations, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the United States is considering ways to limit U.S. investment portfolio flows into China. For example, in May 2020, under pressure from U.S. administration officials, the independent Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board suspended its implementation of plans to change the benchmark of one of its retirement asset funds to an international index that includes companies in emerging markets, including China. China-based companies, including us, may become subject to executive orders or other regulatory actions that may, among other things, prohibit U.S. investors from investing in these companies and delist the securities of these companies from U.S. exchanges. As a result, U.S. and certain other persons may be prohibited from investing in the securities of our Company, whether or not they are listed on U.S. exchanges. For example, in November 2020, the U.S. administration issued U.S. Executive Order 13959, prohibiting investments by any U.S. person in publicly traded securities of certain Chinese companies that are deemed owned or controlled by the Chinese military. In May 2021, the American depositary shares of China Telecom, China Mobile, and China Unicom were delisted from the NYSE to comply with this executive order. In June 2021, the U.S. administration expanded the scope of the executive order to Chinese defense and surveillance technology companies. Geopolitical tensions between China and the United States may intensify and the United States may adopt even more drastic measures in the future.\nChina and other countries have retaliated and may further retaliate in response to new trade policies, treaties and tariffs implemented by the United States. For instance, in response to the tariffs announced by the United States, in 2018 and 2019, China announced it would stop buying U.S. agricultural products and imposed tariffs on over US$185 billion worth of U.S. goods. Although China subsequently granted tariff exemptions for certain U.S. products as a result of trade talks and the phase one trade deal with the United States, it is uncertain whether there will be any further material changes to Chinas tariff policies. Any further actions to increase existing tariffs or impose additional tariffs could result in an escalation of the trade conflict, which would have an adverse effect on manufacturing, trade, and a wide range of industries that rely on trade, including logistics, retail sales, and other businesses and services, which could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, China has issued regulations to give itself the ability to unilaterally nullify the effects of certain foreign restrictions that are deemed to be unjustified to Chinese individuals and entities. The Rules on Counteracting Unjustified Extra-territorial Application of Foreign Legislation and Other Measures promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) on January 9, 2021 with immediate effect, provide that, among other things, Chinese individuals or entities are required to report to the MOFCOM within 30 days if they are prohibited or restricted from engaging in normal business activities with third-party countries or their nationals or entities due to non-Chinese laws or measures; and the MOFCOM, following the decision of the relevant Chinese authorities, may issue prohibition orders contravening such non-Chinese laws or measures. Furthermore, on June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Anti-foreign Sanctions Law, which came into effect on the same day. The Anti-foreign Sanctions Law prohibits any organization or individual from implementing or providing assistance in implementation of discriminatory restrictive measures taken by any foreign state against the citizens or organizations of China. In addition, all organizations and individuals in China are required to implement the retaliatory measures taken by relevant departments of the State Council. Since the aforesaid laws and rules were newly promulgated, there exist high uncertainties as to how such regulations will be interpreted and implemented and how they would affect our business and results of operations or the trading prices of our Shares.\nThe institution of trade tariffs both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically carries the risk of negatively affecting Chinas overall economic condition, which could have a negative impact on us.\nTrade tensions and policy changes have also led to measures that could have adverse effects on China-based issuers, including proposed legislation in the United States that would require listed companies whose audit reports and/or auditors who are subject to review by PCAOB to be subject to enhanced disclosure obligations and be subject to delisting if they do not comply with the requirements.\nThe market price for our shares could be adversely affected by increased tensions between the United States and China.\nRecently there have been heightened tensions in the economic and political relations between the United States and China. On June 30, 2020, the Standing Committee of the PRC National Peoples Congress issued the Law of the Peoples Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). This law defines the duties and government bodies of the HKSAR for safeguarding national security and four categories of offences-secession, subversion, terrorist activities and collusion with a foreign country or external elements to endanger national security-and their corresponding penalties. On July 14, 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, or HKAA, into law, authorizing the U.S. administration to impose blocking sanctions against individuals and entities who are determined to have materially contributed to the erosion of Hong Kongs autonomy. On August 7, 2020, the U.S. government imposed HKAA-authorized sanctions on eleven individuals, including HKSAR chief executive Carrie Lam. The HKAA further authorizes secondary sanctions, including the imposition of blocking sanctions, against foreign financial institutions that knowingly conduct a significant transaction with foreign persons sanctioned under this authority. The imposition of sanctions such as those provided in the HKAA is in practice discretionary and highly political, especially in a relationship as extensive and complex as that between the United States and China. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the HKAA on Hong Kong and companies like the Company. Furthermore, legislative, or administrative actions in respect of Sino-U.S. relations could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us, and the market price of our Shares could be adversely affected.\nThe Chinese government may exert substantial influence over the way we conduct our business operations in China.\nThe Chinese government has exercised, and continues to exercise, substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to conduct our operations in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to regulation of the health product industry, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property ownership and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future could have a significant effect on us and our business.\nChanges in Chinas economic, political, or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nSubstantially all of our operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are affected to a significant extent by economic, political, and legal developments in the PRC or changes in government relations between China and the United States or other governments. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and China with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nThe PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the extent of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies.\nThe PRC government also exercises significant control over Chinas economic growth by allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, regulating financial services and institutions, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past four decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Since 2020 due to the global pandemic, growth of the Chinese economy has slowed down. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall PRC economy but may also have a negative effect on us. Our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In addition, the PRC government has implemented in the past certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRCs economy will continue to grow, or that if there is growth, such growth will be steady and uniform, or that if there is a slowdown, such slowdown will not have a negative effect on its business and results of operations.\nIn July 2021, the Chinese government provided new guidance on China-based companies raising capital outside of China, including through VIE arrangements. In light of such developments, the SEC has imposed enhanced disclosure requirements on China-based companies seeking to register securities with the SEC. As substantially all of our operations are based in China, any future Chinese, U.S. or other rules and regulations that place restrictions on capital raising or other activities by China based companies could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If the business environment in China deteriorates from the perspective of domestic or international investment, or if relations between China and the United States or other governments deteriorate, the Chinese government may intervene with our operations and our business in China and in the United States.\nUncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to you and us.\nWe conduct substantially all of business through our operating subsidiary in the PRC. Our PRC subsidiary, the VIE and subsidiaries of the VIE are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws applicable to FIEs as well as various PRC laws and regulations generally applicable to companies incorporated in China. The PRC legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, a series of new PRC laws and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to evolve rapidly, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform, and enforcement of these laws, regulations, and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit legal protections available to you and us.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may impede our ability to enforce the contracts we have entered into and could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all and may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such unpredictability towards our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights could adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nIn addition, the PRC government has recently announced its plans to enhance its regulatory oversight of Chinese companies listing overseas. The Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities issued on July 6, 2021, called for:\n\u25cf tightening oversight of data security, cross-border data flow and administration of classified information, as well as amendments to relevant regulation to specify responsibilities of overseas listed Chinese companies with respect to data security and information security;\n\u25cf enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies; and\n\u25cf extraterritorial application of Chinas securities laws.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users.\nThe aforementioned policies and any related implementation rules to be enacted may subject us to additional compliance requirement in the future. As these opinions were recently issued, official guidance and interpretation of the opinions remain unclear in several respects at this time. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will remain fully compliant with all new regulatory requirements of these opinions or any future implementation rules on a timely basis, or at all. The Chinese government may promulgate relevant laws, rules and regulations that may impose additional and significant obligations and liabilities on overseas listed Chinese companies regarding data security, cross-border data flow, and compliance with Chinas securities laws. These laws and regulations can be complex and stringent, and many are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, which could result in claims, change to our data and other business practices, regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise affect our business.\nWe may face obstacles from the communist system in the PRC.\nForeign companies conducting operations in the PRC face significant political, economic, and legal risks. The communist regime in the PRC may hinder Western investment in the Company.\nWe may have difficulty establishing adequate management, legal and financial controls in the PRC.\nThe PRC historically has been deficient in Western style management and financial reporting concepts and practices, as well as in modern banking, computer, and other control systems. We may have difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of qualified employees to work in the PRC. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management, legal and financial controls, collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices that meet Western standards.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations can be complex and stringent, and many are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, which could result in claims, changes to its data and other business practices, regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise affect its business. Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the recently enacted or proposed regulations or rules, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules, and if required, whether such clearance can be timely obtained, or at all.\nRegulatory authorities in China have implemented and are considering further legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. New laws and regulations that govern new areas of data protection or impose more stringent requirements may be introduced in China. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in China are often uncertain, in flux and complicated, including differentiated requirements for different groups of people or different types of data.\nThe PRC regulatory and enforcement regime with regard to privacy and data security is evolving. The PRC Cybersecurity Law provides that personal information and important data collected and generated by operators of critical information infrastructure in the course of their operations in the PRC should be stored in the PRC, and the law imposes heightened regulation and additional security obligations on operators of critical information infrastructure. According to the Cybersecurity Review Measures promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China and certain other PRC regulatory authorities in April 2020, which became effective in June 2020, operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security. We do not believe that our company constitutes a critical information infrastructure operator pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures that became effective in April 2020. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period.\nOn July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) for public comments, which proposes to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. The PRC National Security Law defines various types of national security, including technology security and information security.\nOn November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China released the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) and will accept public comments until December 13, 2021. The draft Regulations on Network Data Security provide that data processors refer to individuals or organizations that autonomously determine the purpose and the manner of processing data. If a data processor that processes personal data of more than one million users intends to list overseas, it shall apply for a cybersecurity review. In addition, data processors that process important data or are listed overseas shall carry out an annual data security assessment on their own or by engaging a data security services institution, and the data security assessment report for the prior year should be submitted to the local cyberspace affairs administration department before January 31 of each year.\nWe currently have less than one million registered users on our digital and only require and obtain user information after users register with it. Given that we sell and service products through our digital platform, we may constitute a data processor, but the number of our online registered users is far less than one million. As a result, even if enacted, we would not be required to apply for a cybersecurity review under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments). Nevertheless, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments) or the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments) are still being formulated and subject to further changes Although we believe we currently are not required to obtain clearance from the Cyberspace Administration of China under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), the Regulations on Network Data Security (draft for public comments), or the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, we face uncertainties as to the interpretation or implementation of such regulations or rules and we may in the future be required to perform a data security assessment annually either by ourselves or by retaining a third party data security service provider and submitting such data security assessment report to the local agency every year under the draft Regulations on Network Data Security\nOn June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Data Security Law which took effect on September 1, 2021. The Data Security Law provides for data security and privacy obligations of entities and individuals carrying out data activities, prohibits entities and individuals in China from providing any foreign judicial or law enforcement authority with any data stored in China without approval from competent PRC authority, and sets forth the legal liabilities of entities and individuals found to be in violation of their data protection obligations, including rectification order, warning, fines of up to RMB10 million, suspension of relevant business, and revocation of business permits or licenses.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress of China promulgated the Personal Information Protection Law which took effect on November 1, 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the Personal Information Protection Law specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts, and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individuals rights and interests. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of the Personal Information Protection Law, we cannot assure you that we will comply with the Personal Information Protection Law in all respects and regulatory authorities may order us to rectify or terminate our current practice of collecting and processing sensitive personal information.\nCompliance with the PRC Cybersecurity Law, the PRC National Security Law, the Data Security Law, the Cybersecurity Review Measures, the Personal Information Protection Law, as well as additional laws and regulations that PRC regulatory bodies may enact in the future, may result in additional expenses to us and subject us to negative publicity, which could harm our reputation among users and negatively affect the trading price of our common stock in the future. PRC regulators, including the Department of Public Security, the MIIT, the SAMR and the CAC, have been increasingly focused on regulation in the areas of data security and data protection, and are enhancing the protection of privacy and data security by rulemaking and enforcement actions at central and local levels. We expect that these areas will receive greater and continued attention and scrutiny from regulators and the public going forward, which could increase our compliance costs and subject us to heightened risks and challenges associated with data security and protection. If we are unable to manage these risks, we could become subject to penalties, including fines, suspension of business, prohibition against new user registration (even for a short period of time) and revocation of required licenses, and our reputation and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the above and other regulatory requirements or privacy protection-related laws, rules and regulations could result in reputational damages or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, consumers, or others. These proceedings or actions could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our data and other business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock.\nYou may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us.\nMost of our assets are located outside of the United States and most of our current operations are conducted in the PRC. In addition, all of our directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States. A substantial portion of the assets of these persons is located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these persons. It may also be difficult for you to enforce in U.S. courts judgments on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws against us and our officers and directors, most of whom are not residents in the United States and the substantial majority of whose assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the PRC would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts. Our counsel as to PRC law has advised us that the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments are provided for under the PRC Civil Procedures Law. Courts in China may recognize and enforce foreign judgments in accordance with the requirements of the PRC Civil Procedures Law based on treaties between China and the country where the judgment is made or on reciprocity between jurisdictions. China does not have any treaties or other arrangements that provide for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments with the United States. In addition, according to the PRC Civil Procedures Law, courts in the PRC will not enforce a foreign judgment against us or our directors and officers if they decide that the judgment violates basic principles of PRC law or national sovereignty, security, or the public interest. So, it is uncertain whether a PRC court would enforce a judgment rendered by a court in the United States.\nThe PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities.\nThe PRC government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in China may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, land use rights, property, and other matters. We believe that our operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which we operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations.\nAccordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties or joint ventures.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties, which could limit law enforcement availability.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, decided legal cases have little precedence. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past several decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. Our PRC operating subsidiary and affiliate is subject to PRC laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations change frequently, and the interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For instance, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we are entitled to by law or contract. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative court proceedings and the level of law enforcement that we would receive in more developed legal systems. Such uncertainties, including the inability to enforce our contracts, could affect our business and operations. In addition, confidentiality protections in China may not be as effective as in the United States or other countries. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in the PRC legal system, particularly with regard to our business, including the promulgation of new laws. This may include changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. These uncertainties could limit the availability of law enforcement, including our ability to enforce our agreements.\nOur shares may be delisted under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act if the PCAOB is unable to inspect our auditors. The delisting of our shares, or the threat of their being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuers securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.\nOn June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuers securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three. On September 22, 2021, the PCAOB adopted a final rule implementing the HFCAA, which provides a framework for the PCAOB to use when determining, as contemplated under the HFCAA, whether the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a foreign jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction.\nFurthermore, various equity-based research organizations have recently published reports on China-based companies after examining their corporate governance practices, related party transactions, sales practices and financial statements, and these reports have led to special investigations and listing suspensions on U.S. national exchanges. Any similar scrutiny on us, regardless of its lack of merit, could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to fall, divert management resources and energy, cause us to incur expenses in defending ourselves against rumors, and increase the premiums we pay for director and officer insurance.\nThe SEC may propose additional rules or guidance that could impact us if our auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspection. For example, on August 6, 2020, the Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets, or the PWG, issued the Report on Protecting United States Investors from Significant Risks from Chinese Companies to the then President of the United States. This report recommended the SEC implement five recommendations to address companies from jurisdictions that do not provide the PCAOB with sufficient access to fulfil its statutory mandate. Some of the concepts of these recommendations were implemented with the enactment of the HFCA Act. However, some of the recommendations were more stringent than the HFCA Act. For example, if a companys auditor was not subject to PCAOB inspection, the report recommended that the transition period before a company would be delisted would end on January 1, 2022.\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as having a non-inspection year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above\nThe implications of the requirements of the HFCAA are uncertain. While we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with requirements imposed by U.S. regulators. Such uncertainty could cause the market price of our Shares to be materially and adversely affected, and our securities could be delisted and prohibited from being traded on the national securities exchange earlier than would be required by the HFCAA. If our securities are unable to be listed on another securities exchange by then, such a delisting would substantially impair your ability to sell or purchase our Shares when you wish to do so, and the risk and uncertainty associated with a potential delisting would have a negative impact on the price of our Shares.\nTo the extent that our independent registered public accounting firms audit documentation related to their audit reports for the Company are located in China, the PCAOB may not be able to inspect such audit documentation and, as a result, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued audit opinions on the financial statements included in this Annual Report and will issue audit reports related to the Company in the future. As the auditor of a company filing reports with the SEC and as a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. Our auditor is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and is keeping and safeguarding the working papers of the relevant years in their office in Malaysia. However, to the extent that our auditors work papers are or become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Recent developments with respect to audits of companies of which the major operations are in China, such as us, create uncertainty about the ability of our auditor to fully cooperate with the PCAOBs request for audit work papers without the approval of the Chinese authorities. As a result, our investors may be deprived of the benefits of PCAOBs oversight of our auditors through such inspections.\nShould the PCAOB be unable to fully conduct inspections of our auditors work papers due to a position taken by one or more authorities in the foreign jurisdiction, it will make it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditors audit procedures or quality control procedures. Shareholders may consequently lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements, which would adversely affect the market price of Shares.\nIn addition, trade tensions and policy changes between China and the United States have also led to measures that could have adverse effects on China-based issuers. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCAA, was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA states that, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our Shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the U.S. On March 24, 2021, the SEC adopted interim final rules relating to the implementation of certain disclosure and documentation requirements of the HFCAA. We will be required to comply with these rules if the SEC identifies us as having a non-inspection year under a process to be subsequently established by the SEC. The SEC is assessing how to implement other requirements of the HFCAA, including the listing and trading prohibition requirements described above. Further, the United States Senate passed the Accelerated Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCAAA to require the SEC to prohibit and issuers securities from trading on any U.S, stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three.\nIf our auditor is sanctioned or otherwise penalized by the PCAOB or the SEC as a result of failure to comply with inspection or investigation requirements, our financial statements could be determined to be not in compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or other laws or rules in the United States, which could ultimately result in our Shares being delisted from whatever exchange they may become listed on.\nThe enforcement of the PRC labor contract law may materially increase our costs and decrease our net income.\nChina adopted a new Labor Contract Law, effective on January 1, 2008, and issued its implementation rules, effective on September 18, 2008. The Labor Contract Law and related rules and regulations impose more stringent requirements on employers with regard to, among others, minimum wages, severance payment and non-fixed-term employment contracts, time limits for probation periods, as well as the duration and the times that an employee can be placed on a fixed-term employment contract. Due to the limited period of effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations, and the lack of clarity with respect to their implementation and potential penalties and fines, it is uncertain how they will impact our current employment policies and practices. In particular, compliance with the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may increase our operating expenses. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules and regulations may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable and could result in a material decrease in our profitability.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in China.\nIn recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and highly fluctuating rates of inflation. During the past ten years, the rate of inflation in China has been as high as 5.9% and as low as -0.8%. These factors have led to the adoption by the Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and our company.\nRestrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to receive and use our sales effectively.\nCurrently, all of our revenues are settled in RMB, and any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in RMB to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the RMB for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that FIEs may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks in China authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of RMB for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items. We cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the RMB.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nThe value of our Shares will be indirectly affected by the foreign exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB and between those currencies and other currencies in which our sales may be denominated. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars, as well as earnings from, and the value of, any U.S. dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.\nSince July 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nRestrictions under PRC law on our PRC subsidiaries ability to make dividends and other distributions could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could benefit our business, pay dividends to you, and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nSubstantially all of our sales are earned by our PRC subsidiaries. However, PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent companies. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our PRC subsidiaries are also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of their annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with PRC generally accepted accounting principles to a statutory general reserve fund until the amount in said fund reaches 50% of their registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserve funds can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends. Any limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends and otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nThe PRC government may issue further restrictive measures in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRCs government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC governments restrictive regulations and measures could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIf our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity are found incompliant with the employment and social security, taxation, marketing, tele-communication, or other rules of China, they may face penalties imposed by the PRC government.\nOur PRC subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entity failed to strictly comply with PRC laws and regulations to contribute towards social insurance premium and housing fund on behalf of their employees, as required by the applicable laws and regulations. We may be required by relevant authorities to make up the shortfall of social insurance premium and housing fund. Although we have made efforts to settle tax payables and take compliance measures, if any PRC government authority takes the position that there is non-compliance with the taxation, marketing, tele-communication, or other rules by our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity, they may be exposed to penalties from PRC government authorities, in which case the operation and financial conditions of our PRC subsidiary or consolidated affiliated entity may be adversely affected.\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, we may be classified as a resident enterprise of China. Such classification will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nOn March 16, 2007, the National Peoples Congress of China passed the EIT Law, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules, which took effect on January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties of the enterprise.\nOn April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Concerning Relevant Issues Regarding Cognizance of Chinese Investment Controlled Enterprises Incorporated Offshore as Resident Enterprises pursuant to Criteria of de facto Management Bodies, or the Notice, further interpreting the application of the EIT Law and its implementation non-Chinese enterprise or group controlled offshore entities. Pursuant to the Notice, an enterprise incorporated in an offshore jurisdiction and controlled by a Chinese enterprise or group will be classified as a non-domestically incorporated resident enterprise if (i) its senior management in charge of daily operations reside or perform their duties mainly in China; (ii) its financial or personnel decisions are made or approved by bodies or persons in China; (iii) its substantial assets and properties, accounting books, corporate chops, board and shareholder minutes are kept in China; and (iv) at least half of its directors with voting rights or senior management often resident in China. A resident enterprise would be subject to an enterprise income tax rate of 25% on its worldwide income and must pay a withholding tax at a rate of 10% when paying dividends to its non-PRC shareholders. However, it remains unclear as to whether the Notice is applicable to an offshore enterprise incorporated by a Chinese natural person. Nor are detailed measures on imposition of tax from non-domestically incorporated resident enterprises are available. Therefore, it is unclear how tax authorities will determine tax residency based on the facts of each case.\nWe may be deemed to be a resident enterprise by Chinese tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. In our case, this would mean that income such as interest on financing proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiaries would qualify as tax-exempt income, we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, it is possible that future guidance issued with respect to the new resident enterprise classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC stockholders from transferring our shares.\nIf we were treated as a resident enterprise by PRC tax authorities, we would be subject to taxation in both the U.S. and China, and our PRC tax may not be creditable against our U.S. tax.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Public Notice Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-Tax Resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which came into effect on the same day, revised in October 2017 and December 2017. SAT Bulletin 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to transactions involving the transfer of taxable assets through offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT Bulletin 7 has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Bulletin 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets, as such persons need to determine whether their transactions are subject to these rules and whether any withholding obligation applies.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-Resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017, and revised in June 2018. The SAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nWhere a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such. Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a substance over form principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding, or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who pays for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or may be taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. For transfers of shares of our company by investors who are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident shareholders to penalties and limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries, limit our PRC subsidiaries ability to distribute profits to us, or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe SAFE promulgated the notice on relevant issues relating to domestic residents investment and financing and roundtrip investment through special purpose vehicles (SPV(s)), or Notice 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore SPV undergoes material events relating to material change of capitalization or structure of the PRC resident itself (such as capital increase, capital reduction, share transfer or exchange, merger or spin off).On February 28, 2015, SAFE issued a notice according to which the aforesaid PRC residents or entities are no longer required to register with SAFE or its local branch, instead the aforesaid PRC residents or entities need to register with local banks. We have notified substantial beneficial owners of our ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and to the best of our knowledge, most of those shareholders whom we know are PRC residents have completed the registration. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. In addition, we do not have control over our beneficial owners and cannot assure you that all of our PRC resident beneficial owners will comply with SAFE Circular 37. Failure by an individual to comply with the required SAFE registration and updating requirements described above may result in penalties up to RMB50, 000 imposed on such individual and restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV, including increasing the registered capital of payment of dividends and other distributions to, and receiving capital injections for the offshore SPV. Failure to comply with Notice 37 may also subject relevant PRC resident beneficial owners or the PRC subsidiaries of such offshore SPV to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nFailure to comply with the individual foreign exchange rules relating to the overseas direct investment or the engagement in the issuance or trading of securities overseas by our PRC resident stockholders may subject such stockholders to fines or other liabilities.\nOther than Notice 37, our ability to conduct foreign exchange activities in the PRC may be subject to the interpretation and enforcement of the implementation rules of the administrative measures for individual foreign exchange promulgated by SAFE in January 2007 (as amended and supplemented, the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules). Under the individual foreign exchange rules, any PRC individual seeking to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate registrations in accordance with SAFE provisions. PRC individuals who fail to make such registrations may be subject to warnings, fines or other liabilities.\nWe may not be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. For example, because the investment in or trading of our shares will happen in an overseas public or secondary market where shares are often held with brokers in brokerage accounts, it is unlikely that we will know the identity of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Furthermore, we have no control over any of our future beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the individual foreign exchange rules.\nIt is uncertain how the individual foreign exchange rules will be interpreted or enforced and whether such interpretation or enforcement will affect our ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether the failure by any of our PRC resident stockholders to make the required registration will subject our PRC subsidiaries to fines or legal sanctions on their operations, delay or restriction on repatriation of proceeds of this offering into the PRC, restriction on remittance of dividends or other punitive actions that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Chinese anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or FCPA, and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make most of our sales in China. The PRC also strictly prohibits bribery of government officials. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nIf we become directly subject to the recent scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies, we may have to expend significant resources to investigate and resolve the matter which could harm our business operations, stock price and reputation and could result in a loss of your investment in our stock, especially if such matter cannot be addressed and resolved favorably.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in China, particularly companies like us which have completed so-called reverse merger transactions, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities and mistakes, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in many cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our Company, our business and our stock price. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend our company. This situation will be costly and time consuming and distract our management from growing our company.\nThe disclosures in our reports and other filings with the SEC and our other public pronouncements are not subject to the scrutiny of any regulatory bodies in the PRC. Accordingly, our public disclosure should be reviewed in light of the fact that no governmental agency that is located in China where substantially all of our operations and business are located have conducted any due diligence on our operations or reviewed or cleared any of our disclosure.\nWe are regulated by the SEC and our reports and other filings with the SEC are subject to SEC review in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Unlike public reporting companies whose operations are located primarily in the United States, however, substantially all of our operations are located in China. Since substantially all of our operations and business takes place in China, it may be more difficult for the staff of the SEC to overcome the geographic and cultural obstacles that are present when reviewing our disclosure. These same obstacles are not present for similar companies whose operations or business take place entirely or primarily in the United States. Furthermore, our SEC reports and other disclosure and public pronouncements are not subject to the review or scrutiny of any PRC regulatory authority. For example, the disclosure in our SEC reports and other filings are not subject to the review of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, a PRC regulator that is tasked with oversight of the capital markets in China. Accordingly, you should review our SEC reports, filings and our other public pronouncements with the understanding that no local regulator has done any due diligence on our company and with the understanding that none of our SEC reports, other filings or any of our other public pronouncements has been reviewed or otherwise been scrutinized by any local regulator.\nRisks Related to the Market for Our Securities\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC market, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC market. The OTC market is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. The quotation of our shares on the OTC market may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future. We plan to list our common stock as soon as practicable. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of any stock exchange, or that we will be able to maintain any such listing.\nWe are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, and you may have difficulty selling shares of our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define so-called penny stocks to be an equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. Our common stock is a penny stock and is subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, or the Penny Stock Rule. This rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally, individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual incomes exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouses). For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to sale. As a result, this rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell any of our securities in the secondary market, thus possibly making it more difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nFor any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require delivery, prior to any transaction in penny stock, of a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. Disclosure is also required to be made about sales commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements are required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the Penny Stock Rule. In any event, even if our common stock were exempt from the Penny Stock Rule, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of penny stock, if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common shares less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until September 30, 2024, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if we become a large accelerated filer or if we have issued an aggregate of $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding 3 years. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board deems relevant.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nAs a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require us to implement various corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements and complex accounting rules. Compliance with these public company obligations requires us to devote significant time and resources and places significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increased auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses.\nWe are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to document and test the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we are required under the Exchange Act to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective controls or implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. This could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the public markets and public reporting. Our management team will need to invest significant management time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Nevada law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our Board of Directors has the right to determine the authorized number of directors and to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to control the size of or fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. In addition, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock, in one or more classes or series as may be determined by our Board of Directors. The issuance of shares of common stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nThe Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item because the Company is a smaller reporting company. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nAll land in China is owned by the State. Individuals and companies are permitted to acquire rights to use land or land use rights for specific purposes. In the case of land used for industrial purposes, the land use rights are granted for a certain period of no more than 50 years. This period may be renewed at the expiration of the initial and any subsequent term. Granted land use rights are transferable and may be used as security for borrowings and other obligations. We do not own or have not been granted land use rights to any property in China or any other countries.\nOwned Real Property\nNeither our Company nor the VIE owns any real property.\nLeased Real Property\nKing Eagle (China), King Eagle VIE, and King Eagle (Beijing) entered into multiple lease arrangements in Beijing and Tianjin, the PRC, for their office spaces which they believe are adequate and suitable for their current operations:\nEntity\nDescription of Use\nLeased Square\nMeters\nLocation\nKing Eagle (China)\nOffice space\n970.0\nChaoyang District, Beijing, PRC\nKing Eagle VIE\nOffice space\n178.5\nTianjin Airport Economic Zone, Tianjin, PRC.\nKing Eagle (Beijing)\nOffice space\n146.0\nChaoyang District, Beijing, PRC ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOther than ordinary routine litigation (in which we are not currently involved), we know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against us, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation, and there are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers, or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our Company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nThe information required by Item 4 is not applicable to us, as we have no mining operations in the United States.\nPart II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock was quoted on the OTCBB from November 3, 2017 under the designation CXKJ until November 8, 2021 when the OTCBB was discontinued and our stock commenced trading on the OTC Pink Sheets. On November 9, 2022, our trading symbol was changed to KPEA and on November 14, 2022, our common stock commenced trading on the OTCQB. However, our common stock has not been traded on the OTC market except on a limited and sporadic basis and there is no assurance that a regular public trading market will ever develop. OTC market securities are not listed and traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC market securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers. OTC market issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.\nPrice Range of Common Stock\nThe following table shows, for the periods indicated, the high and low bid prices per share of our post-split common stock as reported by the OTC Markets, Inc. These bid prices represent prices quoted by broker-dealers on the OTCBB quotation service. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down, or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions.\nHigh Low\nFiscal Year 2021\nFirst quarter ended December 31, 2020 $ 0.059 $ 0.048\nSecond quarter ended March 31, 2021 $ 0.225 $ 0.190\nThird quarter ended June 30, 2021 $ 0.415 $ 0.401\nFourth quarter ended September 30, 2021 $ 0.600 $ 0.360\nFiscal Year 2022(1)\nFirst quarter ended December 31, 2021 $ 0.0700 $ 0.0265\nSecond quarter ended March 31, 2022 $ 0.1460 $ 0.0272\nThird quarter ended June 30, 2022 $ 0.2510 $ 0.1000\nFourth quarter ended September 30, 2022 $ 0.2000 $ 0.1400\n(1) Data for fiscal year 2022 is derived from https://finance.yahoo.com.\nHolders\nAs of December 22, 2022, there were 23 registered holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. We will rely on dividends from our PRC operating entity for our funds and PRC regulations may limit the amount of funds distributed to us from our PRC operating entity, which will affect our ability to declare any dividends.\nStock Option and Warrant Grants\nWe have no stock options or warrants granted to our executives, employees, vendors, consultants, or any other parties as of the reporting date.\nRegistration Rights\nWe have not granted anyone any registration rights.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has not adopted any equity compensation plan.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nOur shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various rules under that Act. In general terms, penny stock is defined as any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The rules provide that any equity security is considered to be a penny stock unless that security is registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC, issued by a registered investment company, and excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least $5.00 per share), or based on the issuers net tangible assets or revenues. In the last case, the issuers net tangible assets must exceed $3,000,000 if in continuous operation for at least three years or $5,000,000 if in operation for less than three years, or if the issuers average revenues for each of the past three years exceeds $6,000,000.\nTrading in shares of penny stock is subject to additional sales practice requirements for broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Accredited investors, in general, include individuals with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 (or $300,000 together with their spouse), and certain institutional investors. For transactions covered by these rules, broker-dealers must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of the security and must have received the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the first transaction, of a risk disclosure document relating to the penny stock. A broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, and current quotations for the security. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stocks. These rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to trade or maintain a market in our common stock to the extent that it is penny stock, and may affect the ability of shareholders to sell their shares.\nRule\nIn general, under Rule 144 a person, or persons whose shares are aggregated, who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned shares of our common stock for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner except if the prior owner was one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell all of their shares, provided that current public information about our company is available.\nSales under Rule 144 also may be subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about our Company. Any substantial sale of common stock pursuant to any resale registration statement or Rule 144 may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock by creating an excessive supply.\nBecause we were a shell company with no operations prior to the close of the 2018 Share Exchange, sales of our shares were required to be compliant with Rule 144(i). Pursuant to Rule 144(i), none of our shares of common stock could be sold under Rule 144 until March 2019, which was 12 months after we filed the current report on Form 8-K reporting the closing of the 2018 Share Exchange. Additionally, stockholders could not sell our shares pursuant to Rule 144 unless, at the time of the sale, we had filed with the SEC all reports, other than reports on Form 8-K, required under the Exchange Act for the preceding 12 months.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nInformation regarding any equity securities we have sold within the past three years that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), is set forth below. Each such transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of the provisions of Regulation S (Regulation S), which was adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the Securities Act. Unless stated otherwise: (i) the securities were offered and sold only to non-US Persons, as defined in Regulation S.\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into a share exchange agreement (Share Exchange Agreement) with (i) KP International, a limited liability company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on April 20, 2021; and (ii) the five members of KP International to acquire all the issued and outstanding capital stock of KP International in exchange for the issuance to those members of an aggregate of 34,158,391 shares of our common stock (Reverse Acquisition). Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, and as a condition to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company also agreed to enter into an agreement with Wenhai Xia (the Stockholder), to cancel an aggregate of 15,535,309 shares of the Companys common stock owned by the Stockholder. The Reverse Acquisition was closed on May 17, 2021. None of the KP Internationals stockholders is a U.S. Person (as that term is defined in Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933) and KP International acquired our shares in the Reverse Merger outside of the United States.\nIn issuing these securities to KP Internationals stockholders, we relied upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC. Among other things, the offer or sale was made in an offshore transaction and no directed selling efforts were made in the United States by the issuer, a distributor, any of their respective affiliates, or any person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing. In addition, each of the recipients of the shares certified that he/she/it is not a U.S. Person, as defined in Regulation S, and is not acquiring the securities for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person and agreed to resell such securities only in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption from registration, and agreed not to engage in hedging transactions with regard to such securities unless in compliance with the Securities Act. ITEM 6. RESERVED ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview of the Business\nDue to global health issues and the pandemic, people have increased their health and nutrition consciousness. We believe preventive care is the most effective investment in health.\nTo promote awareness of preventive care among the people in the PRC, we have developed and launched our mobile platform (King Eagle Mall). We have also started planning the development of physical (Smart Kiosk) platforms, with the cooperation of Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd. Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd was formerly our related party due to its being wholly owned by Guoxin Ruilian which also owns Guoxin Zhengye. Guoxin Zhengye was the 8% shareholder of King Eagle (China) but transferred its entire ownership interest in King Eagle (China) to KP Industrial on August 26, 2022.\nKing Eagle Mall\nKing Eagle Mall is a mobile social e-commerce platform which was launched in July 2020 and promotes preventive health care products and services as our core business. It adopts the S2B2C business model and integrates many major health care products and services. We focus on health-related products and services. King Eagle Mall is designed to enable health-related products to be sold by us and by third parties. King Eagle Malls products are divided into two sectors: self-operated products and selected products which promote preventive health care. Our team screens and examines products that are and will be offered both by us and by affiliated merchants. Our major products include health care products such as dietary supplements, nutritional health foods, beauty cosmeceuticals, and other categories of health foods (for instance, milk powder, dried fruits) for supporting the cardiovascular system and bone joint health. We also offer collagen peptides, probiotics, and health foods for improving blood circulation and vein health, as well as household products that can promote and improve a healthier lifestyle for our members. We receive customer orders and may arrange fulfillment through our merchants who are responsible for delivery or we may fulfill customer orders through our outsourced networks. As of December 22, 2022 and September 30, 2022, King Eagle Mall had approximately 15,172 and 15,077 members, respectively.\nWe also operate customer service centers with whom our members can communicate directly for any assistance related to product purchases, suggestions for health care products and services, and delivery logistics.\nSmart Kiosks\nWe introduced the Smart Kiosk concept with support from our related party, Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd, which is wholly owned by Guoxin Ruilian Group Co., Ltd. Guoxin Ruilian Group Co. Ltd. wholly owns Guoxin Zhengye, the former 8% shareholder of King Eagle (China). The smart service kiosk functions as a physical customer service center and as community marketing for attracting customers, providing customer service, promoting our 500+ preventive health care and health related household products, and introducing concepts of maintaining a healthy life. 5G Internet connection is also available for our customers to connect to our online application, King Eagle Mall, so that our customers can access King Eagle Mall and place orders for our products.\nThe construction of Smart Kiosks will be initiated and originally administered by Guoxin Star Network Co., Ltd. However, the central and local governments of the PRC have imposed quarantines and closures in certain affected areas since 2021. The approval process for our applications for construction permits of Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies. Although mainland China relaxed its COVID-19 policies and controls in early December 2022, the number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to rise. We expect the approval process at the local government agencies will be initiated in early 2023.\nRecent Developments\nA new online platform\nIn October 2022, we introduced and implemented a new online platform where we focus on promoting and selling our own brand of preventive health care related products, such as the thermal therapy cabin, to wholesalers and retailers. As of late December 2022, our new online platform had approximately 270 wholesaler members.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings, and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world. Due to restrictions, quarantines, and closures in certain affected areas and government agencies in the PRC, the approval process for our applications for construction permits of Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and the construction projects for Smart Kiosks were therefore postponed.\nBusinesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel or launch face-to-face marketing activities. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the Companys average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 34.4%, from $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nTherefore, we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of the global situation with COVID-19. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.\nRecent Regulatory Developments in China\nUnder current Chinese laws and regulations, the Company believes that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold KP International. Such SAFE registration was effected on May 14, 2021. These shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) were also required to register their equity pledge arrangement by the Equity Pledge Agreement with King Eagle (China). However, the Company faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect King Eagle (Tianjin)s financial performance and the enforceability of the VIE Agreements.\nOn July 6, 2021, the PRC government issued the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities, calling for: (i) tightening oversight of data security, cross-border data flow and administration of classified information, as well as amendments to relevant regulations to specify responsibilities of overseas listed Chinese companies with respect to data security and information security; (ii) enhanced oversight of overseas listed companies as well as overseas equity fundraising and listing by Chinese companies; and (iii) extraterritorial application of Chinas securities laws. As the Opinions on Strictly Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities were recently issued, there is great uncertainty with respect to the interpretation and implementation thereof. We will closely monitor further developments.\nIn addition, on July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (Revision Draft for Comments), or the Measures, for public comment, which propose to authorize the relevant government authorities to conduct cybersecurity review on a range of activities that affect or may affect national security, including listings in foreign countries by companies that possess the personal data of more than one million users. The Measures are soliciting comments and subject to change. As we have less than one million users, we believe that the Measures are not applicable to us even after they take effect in current form. The PRC government is increasingly focused on data security, recently launching cybersecurity review against a number of mobile apps operated by several US-listed Chinese companies and prohibiting these apps from registering new users during the review period. There are great uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws, rules and regulations regarding data and privacy security. We may be required to change our data and other business practices and be subject to regulatory investigations, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in issuer growth or engagement as a result of these laws and policies. Further, our consulting business with respect to overseas listing and capital raising may be adversely affected.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nResults of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nSeptember 30,\nAmount % of\nrevenue Amount % of\nrevenue\nRevenues $ 7,510,059 100.0 % $ 5,587,446 100.0 %\nCost of revenues 1,195,624 15.9 1,001,777 17.9\nGross profit 6,314,435 84.1 4,585,669 82.1\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,680,560 22.4 2,619,588 46.9\nSelling expense 6,641,485 88.4 3,741,389 67.0\nTotal operating expenses 8,322,045 110.8 6,360,977 113.9\nLoss from operations (2,007,610 ) (26.7 ) (1,775,308 ) (31.8 )\nOther income 34,769 0.5 (0.0 )\nLoss before income taxes (1,972,841 ) (26.2 ) (1,774,734 ) (31.8 )\nIncome tax expense - - - -\nNet loss $ (1,972,841 ) (26.2 )% $ (1,774,734 ) (31.8 )%\nRevenues\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, revenues amounted to $7,510,059 and $5,587,446, respectively. Our revenue primarily included the sale of consumer health care and health related household products to our customers via our mobile application, King Eagle Mall, which was launched in July 2020. We recognized our revenue on a gross basis, net of sub-charges and value-added tax (VAT) of gross sales. Compared to the same period in 2021, we generated a higher revenue amount during the year ended September 30, 2022 as our service agents initiated more marketing and promotional activities for our online platform and products during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nCost of revenue\nOur cost of revenue for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $1,195,624 and $1,001,777, respectively. This primarily included the purchase of consumer health care and health related household products from our suppliers. We incurred a higher cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to that in the same period of 2021 because we generated a higher revenue amount during the year ended September 30, 2022 as discussed above.\nGross profit\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our gross profit amounted to $6,314,435, or 84.1%, and $4,585,669, or 82.1%, respectively. Our gross profit margin for the year ended September 30, 2022 was slightly higher than for the year ended September 30, 2021 because our customers tended to purchase fewer selected products during the year ended September 30, 2022. Our selected products mainly consist of agricultural products, which have a higher cost of revenue than the self-operated products such as dietary and nutritional supplements. As such, we generated a higher profit margin during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses and selling expenses. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, our total operating expenses were $8,322,045 and $6,360,977, respectively. The higher operating expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily due to a significant rise in selling expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $1,680,560 and $2,619,588, respectively.\nOur general and administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were comprised of the following:\nSeptember 30,\nEmployee compensation and benefit $ 586,266 $ 729,377\nOffice rent and building management 451,695 425,660\nOffice supplies and meeting 59,450 66,289\nProfessional services fee 408,477 990,889\nBusiness registration 12,794 3,496\nTravel, transportation and gasoline 26,170 63,252\nMeals and entertainment 41,004 35,911\nDepreciation and amortization 50,919 19,546\nRepair and maintenance 15,637 257,881\nOthers 28,148 27,287\nTotal $ 1,680,560 $ 2,619,588\nThe decline in general and administrative expenses by $939,028 was triggered by a decline in employee compensation and benefits by $143,111, office supplies and meeting expenses by $6,839, professional fees by $582,412, travel, transportation and gasoline by $37,082, and repair and maintenance by $242,244, offset by increases in office rent and building management expenses of $26,035, business registration of $9,298, meals and entertainment of $5,093, depreciation and amortization of $31,373, and other increases aggregating $861.\nThe former CEO of the Company resigned on December 1, 2021. Thereafter, we reduced the compensation of our new CEO and existing executives to trim down our administrative costs. Our office supplies and meeting expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 also decreased compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 due to the fact that we did not incur additional office supplies and decoration expense related to the opening of a new business during the year ended September 30, 2022 as we did in the year ended September 30, 2021. Compared to the same period in 2022, we incurred higher professional fees in the year ended September 30, 2021 as we recruited more consultants to assist with our reverse acquisition that was completed in May 2021. Our travel, transportation, and gasoline expense for year ended September 30, 2022 was reduced as we minimized the travel of our executives in order to reduce overhead costs. Our repair and maintenance expense decreased significantly in the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 because such repair and maintenance expense during the year ended September 30, 2021 related to our former office location.\nOn the contrary, during the year ended September 30, 2022, our lease, building management, and associated moving and relocation expenses were higher as we moved to a new office location and incurred an additional rent payment for the new office. Our business registration increased due to an increase in U.S. and BVI business registration fees. We incurred additional meal and entertainment expense for our executives, staff, and business partners for appreciating their efforts to increase sales volume. We recognized an additional depreciation amount, $16,184, for the leasehold improvements of the former office location as the estimated useful life of the relative leasehold improvements was adjusted.\nSelling expenses\nOur selling expenses, which were primarily incurred by our sales and marketing department, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $6,641,485 and $3,741,389, respectively. Compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, our selling expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 surged by $2,900,096, or 77.5%.\nOur selling expenses included the following:\nSeptember 30,\nService agents $ 5,844,846 $ 2,929,080\nEmployee compensation and benefit 489,363 484,825\nOffice supplies and meeting 63,106 206,940\nCustomer services 13,296 14,905\nTravel, transportation and gasoline 84,360 36,469\nMeals and entertainment 87,270 14,877\nDepreciation and amortization 5,013 4,982\nAdvertising 54,231 3,123\nOthers - 46,188\nTotal $ 6,641,485 $ 3,741,389\nThe significant increase in selling expenses was primarily driven by an increase in marketing and promotional service to our service agent by $2,915,766 as our service agents initiated more marketing and promotional activities for our online platform and products, which resulted in our average monthly revenue from our online sales increasing by approximately $0.2 million, from approximately $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to approximately $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Marketing and promotional service fees to our service agents for the year ended September 30, 2022 was twice as much as that in the same period in 2021. As preventive health care product and health related household product market is highly competitive in the mainland China, management believed that in order to boost the Companys sales and increase its market share in the mainland China, it paid more incentives to the service agents to launch more marketing activities and promotions.\nThe increase in selling expense also included an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $4,538, travel and transportation of $47,891, meals and entertainment of $72,393, and advertising of $51,108. During the year ended September 30, 2022, as we aimed to increase our sales revenue and expand our market share, we increased the number of employees in our sales and marketing department during the first quarter of 2022, and our sales and marketing department launched marketing activities in various cities which resulted in higher travel and transportation, meals and entertainment, and advertising expenses.\nOther income\nOther income primarily included bank interest income and foreign exchange gain or loss. Our other income for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $34,769 and $574, respectively. Since the first quarter of 2022, we have derived $36,685 from an additional source of income related to online technical support services for our supplement products provided to a corporate customer. During the year ended September 30, 2022, we also recognized $1,836 bank interest income, offset by a loss on disposal of furniture and fixtures of $3,752. Other income for the same period in 2021 included bank interest income of $1,062 and other expenses of $488.\nIncome tax expense\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the income tax expense of the Company was nil. Due to the net loss before income tax, the Company recognized a full valuation recognition against its deferred tax assets, which included net operating loss carryforwards, as management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize its net operating loss carryforwards in the near future or before they expire.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 our net loss amounted to $1,972,841 and $1,774,734, respectively.\nForeign currency translation adjustment\nThe functional currency of our operations in the PRC is Chinese Yuan or Renminbi (RMB), while the functional currency of our operation in Hong Kong is Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). The financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars using the period end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities; equity is translated at historical exchange rates; and average rates of exchange (for the period) are used for revenues and expenses and cash flows. Transaction gains and/or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. As a result of foreign currency translation, which is a noncash adjustment, we reported a foreign currency translation gain (loss) of $335,412 and $27,761 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This non-cash gain (loss) had an effect of decreasing or increasing our reported comprehensive loss.\nComprehensive loss\nAs a result of our net loss after income taxes, we had a comprehensive loss for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 of $1,637,429 and $1,802,495, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had a cash balance of $267,131 and $2,059,685, respectively.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities totaled $1,592,130. Operating cash outflow was mainly attributable to net loss, $1,972,841, deposit payments to our lessors, $46,802, salary payment, $45,723, and VAT and indirect taxes payment, $206,303, offset by a decrease in prepayments to our vendors, $32,770, an increase in payable to our vendors, $257,078, an increase in customer advances, $142,789, and additional payment from a related party, $251,175.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $139,155, and was primarily related to the purchase of office and computer equipment of $796 and a payment for the renovation of our new office in Beijing of $138,359.\nThere was no financing activity for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe effect of exchange rate change on cash totaled $(61,269) for the year ended September 30, 2022. The resulting change in cash for the period was a decrease of $1,792,554.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1,913,858. Operating cash inflow was primarily attributable to an increase in trade and other payables of $1,404,380, an increase in provision for taxes of $212,862, and deferred revenue of $2,879,891, offset by the net loss of $1,774,734, prepayments to vendors and lessors of $556,585, and operating lease obligation payments of $294,658.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $21,983 and was primarily related to the purchase of office and computer equipment totaling $19,306 and intangible assets totaling $2,677.\nThere was no financing activity for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe effect of exchange rate change on cash totaled $26,644. The resulting change in cash for the period was an increase of $1,918,519.\nSeptember 30,\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (1,592,130 ) $ 1,913,858\nNet cash used in investing activities (139,155 ) (21,983 )\nEffect of exchange rate change on cash (61,269 ) 26,644\nTotal net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,792,554 ) $ 1,918,519\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in our working capital as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nSeptember 30,\nCurrent Assets $ 917,479 $ 2,871,157\nCurrent Liabilities 5,172,077 5,189,941\n$ (4,254,598 ) $ (2,318,784 )\nWe require cash of approximately $2.2 million within the next twelve months, primarily related to third party vendor payables. As of September 30, 2022, we received customer advances in an amount of approximately $3.0 million. We anticipated the majority of the revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year 2023. Management agreed that the amount received is non-refundable. However, this term is not bound by any agreement. Thus, the customers may have the rights to challenge and demand the advances to be refunded under relevant Commercial Laws or regulations. Additionally, we had approximately $0.8 million commitment related to purchase and service agreements and cooperation agreement of Smart Kiosk as of September 30, 2022. See our Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments on page 54.\nIn an effort to support and maintain our financial position and operations, to fulfill our contractual commitments and to meet the demands from our customers for refund of their advanced payments, the Company focused on increasing its revenue through its online platform. In October 2022, we introduced and implemented another online platform which is focused on promoting and selling our own brand health care related products, particularly the thermal therapy cabin, to wholesalers and retailers. We continued to engage service agents to promote our products and to reduce our administrative overhead costs such as executive travel and executive and administrative compensation. Simultaneously, our directors and stakeholders continue to support our operation financially. We believe that such measures will improve our liquidity in the next twelve months. If we are not able to increase revenue or obtain any financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nThe financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The going-concern basis assumes that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial statements. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern depends on the liquidation of its current assets. As of September 30, 2022, the Company experienced cash outflows from operating activities of $1,592,130, the Company incurred a net loss of $1,972,841, and the Company had negative working capital of $4,254,598. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\nIn order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting its own brand of preventive consumer health care related products on its new online platform to reduce the costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its business plan, or that financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the group by providing adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nWe had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of September 30, 2022:\nPayments Due by Period\nLess Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More Than 5 Years Total\nContractual Obligations:\nOperating lease obligations $ 334,514 $ 273,520 $ - $ - $ 608,034\nPurchase and service agreements 35,183 18,727 - - 53,910\nCooperation agreement of Smart Kiosk - 442,668 295,112 - 737,780\nTotal contractual obligations $ 369,697 $ 734,915 $ 295,112 $ - $ 1,399,724\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including arrangements that would affect our liquidity, capital resources, market risk support, and credit risk support or other benefits.\nFuture Financings\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities, or if we are able, there is no guarantee that existing shareholders will not be substantially diluted.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and, consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, and its variable interest entity (VIE). All significant intercompany transactions and balances within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimate and assumptions that impact the presented amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the presented amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 include the collectability of receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets and intangibles, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of accruals for expenses, and tax due.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The going-concern basis assures that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial statements. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern depends on the liquidation of its current assets and business developments. In assessing the Companys liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Companys liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses, and capital expenditure obligations. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred cash outflows from operating activities of $1,592,130, a net loss of $1,972,841, and negative working capital of $4,254,598. Moreover, there was a delay in the progress of the planning of Smart Kiosks due to the lockdown of the affected areas in the PRC. Although the business and markets in mainland China have reopened as mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022, the number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company continues to monitor its operations to help refine its financial liquidity. The financial liquidity of the Company has declined to a very unhealthy level in this year due to the decline in the balance of cash and cash equivalents. Options under consideration in the review process include, but are not limited to, increase of sales through the Companys online business, reduction of overhead costs, fund advance from the Companys stockholders and directors, or financing through the issuance of shares. Our new online platform, which focuses on promoting and selling our own brand preventive health care products to wholesalers and retailers, was placed in service in October 2022. Since the first quarter of 2022, the Company has been focusing on increasing its revenue through its online platform and slimming its administrative overhead costs. For example, we reduced the compensation and benefits of our executives, decreased office supplies expense, and trimmed staff meeting expense. Additionally, the Company obtained a fund advance of approximately $0.3 million from one of the shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) to meet its working capital requirements.\nIn order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting and selling its own brand health care products on its new online platform, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its business plan, or that financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the group by providing adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.\nCOVID-19 Outbreak\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings, and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world. Due to restrictions, quarantines and closures in certain affected areas and government agencies in the PRC, the approval process of our applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and construction projects of Smart Kiosks were therefore postponed.\nBusinesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the Companys average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 34.4%, from $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nTherefore, we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of global situation of COVID-19. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary share equivalents, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding during the period. However, ordinary share equivalents are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Our entity in the British Virgin Islands uses the U.S. dollar. Our entities in the PRC and Hong Kong use the local currencies, Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), as their functional currencies as determined based on the criteria of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by www.xe.com at the end of the period. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average translation rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) amounted to $279,367 and $(32,016) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nBelow is a table with foreign exchange rates used for translation:\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022\n(Average Rate)\nHong Kong\nDollar\n(HKD)\nChinese\nRenminbi\n(RMB)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.8221 6.5473\nAs of September 30, 2022 (Closing Rate)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.8500 7.1159\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021\n(Average Rate)\nHong Kong\nDollar\n(HKD)\nChinese\nRenminbi\n(RMB)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.7631 6.5101\nAs of September 30, 2021 (Closing Rate)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.7851 6.4466\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions, and a certain amount of cash kept in electronic wallets, e-wallets.\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain accounts with various financial institutions in the PRC, and also e-wallets. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, cash balances held in PRC banks are uninsured. Monies that are held in e-wallets are deemed equivalent to cash, are highly liquid, and are relatively unsafe compared to cash in banks. We have not experienced any losses in bank accounts or e-wallets and believe we are not exposed to significant risks with respect to our cash in bank accounts and low risk with respect to our cash kept in e-wallets.\nFinancial Instrument\nThe carrying amount reported on the balance sheet for cash, other receivables, accrued liabilities, and other payables approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Gains and losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in operating income (loss). Major additions, renewals, and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are recognized as expense as incurred.\nDepreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets as follows:\nClassification\nEstimated\nuseful life\nLeasehold improvements\nyears\nOffice equipment\nyears\nComputer equipment\nyears\nComputer software\nyears\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets represent the licensing cost for trademark registrations. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over estimated useful lives, and are reviewed annually for impairment. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including buildings and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When we identify an impairment, reduce the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, management determined that there was no impairment.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n\u25cf Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nThe Companys financial assets and liabilities include cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company follows the ASC 850-10 Related Party Disclosures for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to section 850-10-20, related parties include (i) affiliates of the Company; (ii) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; (iii) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; (iv) principal owners of the Company; (v) management of the Company; (vi) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to the extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and (vii) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to the extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: (i) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; (ii) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented; and (iii) such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the nature of the related party transactions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. Our other comprehensive loss for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is comprised of sales of goods and represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of goods. Revenue was recorded on a gross basis, net of surcharges and value added tax (VAT) of gross sales. Pursuant to FASB ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), the Company recorded revenue on a gross basis because the Company is the primary obligor of the sales arrangements has latitude in establishing prices, has discretion in suppliers selection and assumes credit risks on receivables on gross sales from customers.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) using the full retrospective transition method. The Companys adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\n\u25cf identify the contract with a customer;\n\u25cf identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf determine the transaction price;\n\u25cf allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nConsistent with the criteria of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, we also consider the following indicators to assess whether control of a promised good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment; (ii) legal title; (iii) physical possession; (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership; and (v) acceptance of the good or service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue results from transactions where the Company has received the payments from the customers but revenue recognition criteria under the five-step model of ASC Topic 606 have yet to be met. Once all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied, the revenues will be recognized upon the transfer of risk and rewards to the customers in the consolidated statement of operations. We anticipate the majority of the revenue will be recognized in fiscal year 2023. Management agreed that the amount received is non-refundable. However, this term is not bound by any agreement. Thus, the customers may have the rights to challenge and demand the advances to be refunded under relevant Commercial Laws or regulations.\nAccrued Product Liability\nThe Company records accruals for product liability when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances, and prior claims experience. Accruals for product credit are valued based upon the Companys prior claims experience, including defect goods, goods lost in transit. We have experienced insignificant amount of goods returned and claims from goods lost in transit from the past, our product liability is insignificant; therefore, Management believes product liability accrual as at September, 30 2022 and 2021 is not required.\nDiscount allowed - Accrued Store-Credit\nWe provide store-credit, Golden Beans to our customers after sales of goods to them. The Golden Beans can be utilized against their future purchases with restrictions and expiry date. The amount utilized will be recognized as direct discount as and when the sales arise, and the price net of this discount has been controlled and set by the management, to ensure that the sales will always result in a gross profit. As such, we do not accrue any liability from this store-credit as there is no present obligation arising from this Golden Bean as of September, 30 2022, and 2021, and the utilization of these Golden Beans is not expected to result in an outflow from the Companys resources embodying economic benefits.\nLease\nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Companys incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable lease term in calculating the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nThe Company may recognize the lease payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operation on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and variable lease payments in the periods in which the obligations for those payments are incurred, if any. The lease payments under the lease arrangements are fixed.\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients which allow the Company to carryforward its historical lease classification, its assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and its initial direct costs for any lease that exists prior to adoption of the new standard.\nThe Company also elected to apply the short-term lease exception for lease arrangements with a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement. Lease terms used to compute the present value of lease payments do not include any option to extend, renew, or terminate the lease that the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise upon the lease inception. Accordingly, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses are all costs associated with the original development and design of the product as well as any intellectual property (IP) generated during the development phase, including patents and copyrights. Research and development expenses are included in the overall operating expenses and reflected as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe purchase the consumer preventive health food and health related household products sold on our platforms from our suppliers; we did not develop, design, or manufacture those products. Moreover, although we have built our online platform and mobile commerce in-house, the compensation costs for our in-house technology team were not significant. Accordingly, instead of capitalizing the compensation costs of our in-house technology team as Research and Development in Balance Sheet or presenting it as Research and Development expenses, we included these amounts in Employee Compensation and Benefit expenses within General and Administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nSelling Expenses\nSelling expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional service fee to service agents and other costs incurred by our sales and marketing department such as staff costs, office supplies and other incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers.\nOur selling expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $6,641,485 and $3,741,389, respectively. We recognized the marketing and promotional service expense when our service agents performed marketing activities, promotions, and exhibitions for our business and products. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded marketing and promotional service fee to our service agents in an amount of $5,844,846 and $2,929,080, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and other receivable. As September 30, 2022 and 2021, $252,512 (RMB1,796,861) and $1,886,622 (RMB12,162,295), respectively, were deposited with various major financial institutions located in the PRC. While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness.\nHistorically, deposits in Chinese banks are secure due to state policy to protect depositor interests. However, China promulgated a Bankruptcy Law in August 2006 that came into effect on June 1, 2007, which contains a separate article expressly stating that the State Council may promulgate implementation measures to provide for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law. Under the current Bankruptcy Law, a Chinese bank may file bankruptcy if it deems itself to be insolvent. In addition, since Chinas concession to the World Trade Organization, foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in China and have intensified competition in many aspects, especially since the opening of the Renminbi business to foreign banks in late 2006. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy at the institutions that the Company maintains deposits has increased. In the event of bankruptcy, the Company is unlikely to reclaim its deposits in full since it is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor under PRC laws.\nRisks of variable interest entity structure\nIn the opinion of management, (i) the corporate structure of the Company is in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations; (ii) the VIE Arrangements are valid and binding, and do not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (iii) the business operations of the foreign-invested enterprise and the VIE are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations in all material respects.\nHowever, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. Accordingly, the Company cannot be assured that PRC regulatory authorities will not ultimately take a contrary view to the foregoing opinion of its management. If the current corporate structure of the Company or the VIE Arrangements is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws and regulations, the Company may be required to restructure its corporate structure and operations in the PRC to comply with changing and new PRC laws and regulations. In the opinion of management, the likelihood of loss in respect of the Companys current corporate structure or the VIE Arrangements is remote based on current facts and circumstances.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. The Company is a holding company and it relies on dividends paid by the Companys operating subsidiaries in China for its cash needs. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect its liquidity and cash flows. To the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for its operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount the Company would receive. Conversely, if the Company decides to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount the Company would receive.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty raising liquid funds to meet commitments as they fall due. See our commitments and contingencies in Note 13 under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In meeting its liquidity requirements, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of consumer health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting its own brand of preventive health care related products on its new online platform to reduce its costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors.\nConcentration of customers and vendors\nThere was no revenue from customers that individually represent greater than 10% of the total revenues for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, four major vendors accounted for 18%, 16%, 16% and 12% of the Companys total cost of sales.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, three major vendors accounted for 22%, 16% and 14% of the Companys total cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe apply ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, to account for uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows the ASC 450-20, Contingencies to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time, that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIncome Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which modifies and eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes. This standard was effective for KPIL after September 30, 2021. The Company evaluated that this new guidance does not have significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nFinancial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 revises the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. Originally, ASU 2016-13 was effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). This ASU defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for public companies that are considered smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is planning to adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The Company is currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn the period from October 2022 through December 2022, the FASB has not issued any additional accounting standards updates that have a significant impact on the Company. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item because the Company is a smaller reporting company. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur consolidated financial statements are included on pages through, which appear at the end of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nOn January 6, 2021, Kun Peng International Ltd. (the Company) provided Malone Bailey, LLP (Malone Bailey) with its disclosures in the Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the termination of the engagement of Malone Bailey and requested in writing that Malone Bailey furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not they agree with such disclosures. Malone Baileys response was filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 8, 2021.\nThe auditor reports by Malone Bailey contained in the financial statements of the Company for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, filed as part of the annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion or were qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, other than to state that there is substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. There had been no disagreements with Malone Bailey on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure during the years ended September 30, 2019, and 2018, nor in the subsequent period through January 6, 2021.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company engaged JLKZ CPA LLP (JLKZ) as its independent accountant to provide auditing services for going forward for the Company. The Company has terminated the engagement of Malone Bailey. The decision to hire JLKZ was approved by the Companys Board of Directors.\nDuring our two most recent fiscal years and through the subsequent interim period through the date Malone Bailey was dismissed, Malone Bailey did not advise us as to any reportable events as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v)(A) through (D) of Regulation S-K (Item 304). Furthermore, during our two most recent fiscal years, and the subsequent interim period prior to engaging JLKZ, we (nor anyone on our behalf) did not consult JLKZ regarding either the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to us nor oral advice was provided that JLKZ concluded was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Item 304 and the related instructions to this item) or a reportable event (as described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of Item 304).\nWe provided Malone Bailey with a copy of the disclosures/statements we made in response to Item 304(a). We requested and received from Malone Bailey a letter, dated January 7, 2021, addressed to the SEC stating that it agreed with such statements. A copy of the letter was attached as Exhibit 16.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated January 8, 2021.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Board of Directors of KPIL engaged J&S Associate (AF002380) (JS) as its independent auditor for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The Board of Directors dismissed JLKZ CPA LLP (JLKZ), concurrently with the engagement of JS.\nOn November 29, 2021, the Company advised JLKZ of its dismissal, and requested that JLKZ furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission that discloses the information required by Item 304(a)(1) of Regulation S-K, including compliance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K. A copy of that letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission from JLKZ was filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K dated November 29,2021.\nDuring the years fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2020 and the subsequent interim periods through September 30, 2021, the Company has not consulted with JS regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to any specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Companys financial statements; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(iv) and the related instructions) or reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 304(a)(1)(v)).\nThe Company has given JLKZ permission to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor principal accountant-JS.\nThe audit report of JLKZ on the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, and for the interim period through November 29, 2021, there were no (i) disagreements with JLKZ on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to JLKZs satisfaction, would have caused JLKZ to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report for such year; or (ii) reportable events. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15I under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Based on his evaluation as of the end of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer and principal accounting manager, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in insuring that the information relating to our Company required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to the existence of the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf A lack of sufficient and adequately trained internal accounting and finance personnel with appropriate understanding of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements;\n\u25cf A lack of segregation of duties within significant accounts;\n\u25cf A lack of a functioning audit committee and a majority of outside directors on the Companys Board of Directors.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs of September 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that are considered to be material weaknesses as described herein above. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nNotwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management believes that the financial statements included in its reports fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. We continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Once our cash position improves, we plan to hire an experienced controller and work to build an internal accounting team with sufficient in-house expertise in US GAAP reporting. However, due to our current limited cash flow, we cannot assure you when we will be able to implement those remediation methods.\nBecause we are an emerging growth company, this Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.\n(b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth fiscal quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, covered by this report that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than the facts disclosed above.

This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes, and professional experience. Our Board of Directors believes that there are general requirements for service on the Board that are applicable to directors and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole but not necessarily by each director. The Board considers the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Boards overall composition and the Companys current and future needs.\nQualifications for All Directors\nIn its assessment of each potential candidate, including those recommended by the stockholders, the Board will consider the nominees judgment, integrity, experience, independence, understanding of the Companys business or other related industries, and such other factors it determines are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. The Board also takes into account the ability of a director to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company.\nThe Board requires that each director be a recognized person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field. Each director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, an appreciation of multiple cultures, and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. In addition to the qualifications required of all directors, the Board conducts interviews of potential director candidates to assess intangible qualities including the individuals ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially.\nQualifications, Attributes, Skills, and Experience to be Represented on the Board as a Whole\nThe Board has identified particular qualifications, attributes, skills, and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole, in light of the Companys current needs and its business priorities. The Board believes that it should include some directors with a high level of financial literacy and some directors who possess relevant business experience as a chief executive officer, president, or similar position at a company.\nCode of Ethics\nWe are developing a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officers and principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and also to other employees.\nCorporate Governance\nThe business and affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors. Each stockholder will be given specific information on how he or she can direct communications to the officers and directors of the Company at our annual stockholders meetings. All communications from stockholders are relayed to the members of the Board of Directors.\nRole in Risk Oversight\nOur Board of Directors is primarily responsible for overseeing our risk management processes. The Board of Directors receives and reviews periodic reports from management, legal counsel, and others, as considered appropriate, regarding our Companys assessment of risks. The Board of Directors focuses on the most significant risks facing our Company and our Companys general risk management strategy, and also ensures that risks undertaken by our Company are consistent with the Boards appetite for risk. While the Board oversees our Companys risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day risk management processes. We believe this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing our Company and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board of Directors intends to exercise its oversight in the following manner:\n\u25cf appointing, retaining, and overseeing the work of the independent auditors, including resolving disagreements between the management and the independent auditors relating to financial reporting;\n\u25cf approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by the independent auditors;\n\u25cf reviewing annually the independence and quality control procedures of the independent auditors;\n\u25cf reviewing and approving all proposed related party transactions;\n\u25cf discussing the annual audited financial statements with the management; and\n\u25cf meeting separately with the independent auditors to discuss critical accounting policies, management letters, recommendations on internal controls, the auditors engagement letter and independence letter and other material written communications between the independent auditors and the management.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nWe intend to establish the following committees:\nAudit Committee. The audit committee will consist of our independent directors and its duties will be to recommend to the Board the engagement of independent auditors to audit our financial statements and to review our accounting and auditing principles. The audit committee will review the scope, timing and fees for the annual audit and the results of audit examinations performed by the internal auditors and independent public accountants, including their recommendations to improve the system of accounting and internal controls. The audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively of directors who are, in the opinion of the Board, free from any relationship which would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment as a committee member and who possess an understanding of financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert. The Board currently acts as our audit committee. The Board has not designated an audit committee financial expert as defined in Regulation S-K and is seeking an additional director that is independent as that term is used in Section 10A of the Exchange Act.\nCompensation Committee. The compensation committee will review and approve our salary and benefits policies, including compensation of executive officers.\nNominating Committee. Our Board of Directors currently acts as our nominating committee and our Company does not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for stockholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. The directors believe that, given the early stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our directors assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or stockholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nAll proceedings of our Board of Directors were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the corporate laws of the state of Nevada and the bylaws of our Company, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the directors duly called and held.\nA stockholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our president, at the address appearing on the first page of this Annual Report.

The base salary level is established and reviewed based on the level of responsibilities, the experience and tenure of the individual, and the current and potential contributions of the individual. The base salary is compared to the list of similar positions within comparable peer companies and consideration is given to the executives relative experience in his or her position. Base salaries are reviewed periodically and at the time of promotion or other changes in responsibilities.\nWe intend to form a compensation committee to oversee the compensation of our named executive officers. The majority of the members of the compensation committee will be independent directors.\nCompensation of Directors\nDirectors are permitted to receive fixed fees and other compensation for their services as directors.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered from an accumulated deficit of $as at December 31, 2022. These factors create uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or are required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosure that are material to the financial statement and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ J&S Associate\nCertified Public Accountants\nPCAOB Number: 6743\nDecember 29, 2022\nMalaysia\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nKUN PENG INTERNATIONAL LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nSeptember 30,\nNote\n(restated)\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 267,131 $ 2,059,685\nAdvance and prepayments 268,306 338,629\nOther receivables 65,850 123,824\nAmount due from a related party 316,192 349,019\nTotal current assets\n917,479 2,871,157\nNoncurrent assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 134,023 68,725\nIntangible assets, net 2,082 2,568\nSecurity deposits\n43,062 -\nRight-of-use assets 675,655 282,466\nOthers\n8,317 -\nTotal noncurrent assets\n863,139 353,759\nTotal assets\n$ 1,780,618 $ 3,224,916\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n1,538,741 1,430,576\nDeferred revenue 2,960,357 3,122,705\nPayroll payable\n53,890 105,923\nTax payable\n47,330 261,771\nAmounts due to related parties 267,006 39,629\nOperating lease obligations, current portion 304,753 229,337\nTotal current liabilities\n5,172,077 5,189,941\nNoncurrent liabilities\nOperating lease obligations, net of current portion 264,124 53,129\nTotal noncurrent liabilities\n264,124 53,129\nTotal liabilities\n5,436,201 5,243,070\nCommitment and contingencies\n- -\nEquity\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized; no shares issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 -

Guoxin Zhengye agreed to transfer its 8% ownership interest in King Eagle (China) to KP Industrial on August 26, 2022. As a result of the transfer, KP Industrial is the sole shareholder of King Eagle (China).\nSome of the business engaged in by King Eagle (Tianjin) is restricted or prohibited for foreign investment under PRC regulations. As such, King Eagle (China) has entered into the VIE Agreements with King Eagle (Tianjin) and their shareholders. We do not own any equity interests in King Eagle (Tianjin), but control and receive the economic benefits of their respective business operations through the VIE Agreements. The VIE Agreements enable us to provide King Eagle (Tianjin) with consulting services on an exclusive basis, in exchange for all of its annual profits, if any. In addition, we are able to appoint its senior executives and approve all matters requiring approval of its shareholders. The VIE Agreements are comprised of a Consulting Service Agreement, Business Operation Agreement, Proxy Agreement, Equity Disposal Agreement, and Equity Pledge Agreement.\nUnder current Chinese laws and regulations, the Company believes that the VIE Agreements are not subject to any government approval. The shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) were required to register with SAFE when they established offshore vehicles to hold KP International, and such SAFE registration was effected on May 14, 2021. These shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) will have to register their equity pledge arrangement as required under the Equity Pledge Agreement with King Eagle (China). The Company faces uncertainty with respect to future actions by the PRC government that could significantly affect King Eagle (Tianjin)s financial performance and the enforceability of the VIE Agreements.\nKing Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd.\nKing Eagle (Tianjin) Technology Co., Ltd. (King Eagle (Tianjin)) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Tianjin Pilot Free Trade Zone in the Peoples Republic of China on September 2, 2020, with a registered capital of approximately $1.5 million (RMB 10 million). We do not own any of the equity of King Eagle VIE. It is owned by multiple individuals: Chengyuan Li (approximately 45.5%), Xiujin Wang (approximately 10.5%), Yuanyuan Zhang (approximately 10%), Jinjing Zhang, Wanfeng Hu, Cuilian Liu, and Zhizhong Wang (each of whom owns approximately 6%), Zhandong Fan and Hui Teng (each of whom owns approximately 5%). Those shareholders also indirectly owned KP International Holding prior to its acquisition by the Company through two British Virgin Islands entities: Kunpeng Tech Limited and Kunpeng TJ Limited. Additionally, Chengyuan Li is a director and Yuanyuan Zhang is Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nKun Peng Tian Yu Health Technology (Tianjin) Co., Ltd.\nKun Peng Tian Yu Health Technology Co., Ltd. (KP Tian Yu) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Tianjin Pilot Free Trade Zone in the Peoples Republic of China on August 10, 2021 with a registered capital of RMB 5 million (US$0.7 million). Its wholly owned by KP (Hong Kong).\nKing Eagle (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd\nKing Eagle (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd (King Eagle (Beijing)) was incorporated as a limited liability company in Beijing in the Peoples Republic of China on December 1, 2022 with a registered capital of RMB 5 million (US$0.7 million). It is a wholly owned by King Eagle (Tianjin).\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The consolidated financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and variable interest entity (VIE). All significant intercompany transactions and balances within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimate and assumptions that impact the presented amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the presented amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 include the collectability of receivables, the useful lives of long-lived assets and intangibles, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of accruals for expenses and tax due.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern basis. The going-concern basis assures that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary course of business at amounts disclosed on the financial statements. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern depends on the liquidation of its current assets and business developments. In assessing the Companys liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Companys liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company incurred cash outflows from operating activities of $1,592,130, a net loss of $1,972,841, and negative working capital of $4,254,598. Moreover, there was a delay in the progress of the planning of smart kiosk due to the lockdown of the affected areas in the PRC. Although the business and markets in mainland China have reopened as mainland China has relaxed its policies and controls relating to the COVID-19 in early December 2022, the infection cases of the COVID-19 are expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company continues to monitor its operations to help refine the Companys financial liquidity. The financial liquidity of the Company has declined to very unhealthy level in this year due to the decline in the balance of cash and cash equivalent. Options under consideration in the review process include, but not limited to, increase of sales on its online business, reduction of overhead costs, fund advance from the Companys stockholders and directors, or financing through issuance of shares. Besides, our new online platform which focuses on promoting and selling own brand preventive health care products to wholesalers and retailers was placed in service in October 2022. Since the first quarter of 2022, the Company has been focusing on increasing its revenue through its online platform to reduce the costs of goods sold and slimming its administrative overhead costs. For example, we reduced the compensation and benefits of our executives, decreased office supplies expense, trimmed staff meeting expense. Additionally, the Company obtained a fund advance of approximately $0.3 million from one of the shareholders of King Eagle (Tianjin) to meet its working capital requirements.\nIn order to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting and selling its own brand health care products on its new online platform to reduce costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs or obtaining a financing from its stockholders or directors. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to increase revenue, that it will be able to successfully implement its business plan, or that financing that will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The directors will continue to support the group by providing adequate financial assistance to enable the group to continue its business operations for the foreseeable future.\nCOVID-19 Outbreak\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, limitations on social or public gatherings, and the temporary closure of business venues and facilities around the world. Due to restrictions, quarantines and closures in certain affected areas and government agencies in the PRC, the approval process of our applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks was delayed by the local governmental agencies and construction projects of Smart Kiosks were therefore postponed.\nBusinesses and markets in mainland China have reopened and mainland China relaxed its policies and controls relating to COVID-19 in early December 2022. The number of cases of COVID-19 is expected to increase greatly which may cause restrictions on our service agents to travel and launch face-to-face marketing activities. Construction of our Smart Kiosks may not be immediate, which impacts our plan of enhancing our face-to-face customer services and increasing our market share. The Company continues to focus its business on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and to promote its own brand of consumer health care and health related household products on its new online platform, which was introduced and implemented in October 2022, to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19. The Company also follows up closely with the local governmental agencies regarding its applications for construction permits for Smart Kiosks. However, as the pandemic increased overall public health consciousness in the PRC, the Companys average monthly online sale revenue increased by $0.2 million, or 34.4%, from $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nTherefore, we do not expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results at this time. However, it is not possible to predict the unanticipated consequence of the pandemic on our future business performance and liquidity due to the severity of global situation of COVID-19. The Company continues to monitor and assess the evolving situation closely and evaluate its potential exposure.\nEarnings (loss) Per Share\nBasic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares as adjusted for the effect of dilutive ordinary share equivalents, if any, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive ordinary share equivalents outstanding during the period. However, ordinary share equivalents are not included in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which a net loss is recorded.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. Dollar. Our entity in British Virgin Islands use U.S. dollar. Our entities in the PRC and Hong Kong use the local currencies, Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), as its functional currencies as determined based on the criteria of ASC 830, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by www.xe.com at the end of the period. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average translation rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of equity. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred. Translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) amounted to $279,367 and $(32,016) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nBelow is a table with foreign exchange rates used for translation:\nSCHEDULE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022\n(Average Rate)\nHong Kong\nDollar\n(HKD)\nChinese\nRenminbi\n(RMB)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.8221 6.5473\nAs of September 30, 2022 (Closing Rate)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.8500 7.1159\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021\n(Average Rate)\nHong Kong\nDollar\n(HKD)\nChinese\nRenminbi\n(RMB)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.7631 6.5101\nAs of September 30, 2021 (Closing Rate)\nUnited States dollar ($1) 7.7851 6.4466\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and a certain amount of cash kept in electronic wallets, e-wallets.\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. We maintain accounts with various financial institutions in the PRC, and also e-wallets. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, cash balances held in PRC banks are uninsured. Monies that are held in e-wallets are deemed equivalent to cash, they are highly liquid, and are relatively unsafe compared to cash in banks. We have not experienced any losses in bank accounts or e-wallets and believe we are not exposed to significant risks with respect to our cash in bank accounts and low risk for our cash in e-wallets.\nFinancial Instrument\nThe carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash, other receivables, accrued liabilities and other payables approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Gains and losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in operating income (loss). Major additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are recognized as expense as incurred.\nDepreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is computed using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT USEFUL LIVES\nClassification\nEstimated\nuseful life\nLeasehold improvements\nyears\nOffice equipment\nyears\nComputer equipment\nyears\nComputer software\nyears\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets represent the licensing cost for the trademark registration. For intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Whenever any such impairment exists, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. For intangible assets with definite lives, they are amortized over estimated useful lives, and are reviewed annually for impairment. The Company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including buildings and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When we identify an impairment, reduce the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, management determined that there was no impairment.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements, for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of non-financial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\n\u25cf Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nThe Companys financial assets and liabilities include cash, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Company follows the ASC 850-10, Related Party Disclosures for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe consolidated financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented; and c) such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the nature of the related party transactions.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are included in comprehensive income but are excluded from net income (loss) as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders equity. Our other comprehensive loss for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is comprised of sales of goods and represents the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to upon the transfer of goods. Pursuant to FASB ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (TOPIC 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), the Company recorded revenue on a gross basis, net of surcharges and value added tax (VAT) of gross sales. The Company recorded revenue on a gross basis because the Company is the primary obligor of the sales arrangements has latitude in establishing prices, has discretion in suppliers selection and assumes credit risks on receivables on gross sales from customers.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09) using the full retrospective transition method. The Companys adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\n\u25cf identify the contract with a customer;\n\u25cf identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf determine the transaction price;\n\u25cf allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf recognize revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nConsistent with the criteria of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue when performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time, we also consider the following indicators to assess whether control of a promised good or service is transferred to the customer: (i) right to payment, (ii) legal title, (iii) physical possession, (iv) significant risks and rewards of ownership, and (v) acceptance of the good or service. For performance obligations satisfied over time, we recognize revenue over time by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of a performance obligation.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue results from transactions where the Company has received the payments from the customers but revenue recognition criteria under the five-step model of ASC Topic 606 have yet to be met. Once all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied, the revenues will be recognized upon the transfer of risk and rewards to the customers in the consolidated statement of operations. We anticipated the majority of the revenue will be recognized in the fiscal year 2023. Management agreed that the amount received is non-refundable; however, this term is not bound by any agreement. Thus, the customers may have the rights to challenge and demand the advances to be refunded under relevant Commercial Laws or regulations.\nAccrued Product Liability\nThe Company records accruals for product liability when deemed probable and estimable based on facts and circumstances, and prior claims experience. Accruals for product credit are valued based upon the Companys prior claims experience, including defect goods, goods lost in transit. We have experienced insignificant amount of goods returned and claims from goods lost in transit from the past, our product liability is insignificant; therefore, Management believes product liability accrual as at September, 30 2022 and 2021 is not required.\nDiscount allowed - Accrued Store-Credit\nWe provide store-credit, Golden Beans to our customers after sales of goods to them. The Golden Beans can be utilized against their future purchases with restrictions and expiry date. The amount utilized will be recognized as direct discount as and when the sales arise, and the price net of this discount has been controlled and set by the management, to ensure that the sales will always result in a gross profit. As such, we do not accrue any liability from this store-credit as there is no present obligation arising from this Golden Bean as of September, 30 2022, and 2021, and the utilization of these Golden Beans is not expected to result in an outflow from the Companys resources embodying economic benefits.\nLease\nUnder ASC Topic 842, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is the Companys incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date. The Company generally uses the base, non-cancelable lease term in calculating the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nThe Company may recognize the lease payments in the condensed consolidated statements of operation on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and variable lease payments in the periods in which the obligations for those payments are incurred, if any. The lease payments under the lease arrangements are fixed.\nThe Company elected the package of practical expedients which allow the Company to carryforward its historical lease classification, its assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease, and its initial direct costs for any lease that exists prior to adoption of the new standard.\nThe Company also elected to apply the short-term lease exception for lease arrangements with a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement. Lease terms used to compute the present value of lease payments do not include any option to extend, renew, or terminate the lease that the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise upon the lease inception. Accordingly, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities do not include leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses are all costs associated with the original development and design of the product as well as any intellectual property (IP) generated during the development phase, including patents and copyrights. Research and development expenses are included in the overall operating expenses and reflected as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations.\nWe purchase the consumer preventive health food and health related household products sold on our platforms from our suppliers and we did not develop, design or manufacture those products. Moreover, although we have built our online platform and mobile commerce in-house, the compensation costs for our in-house technology team were not significant. Accordingly, instead of capitalizing the compensation costs of our in-house technology team as Research and Development in Balance Sheet or presenting it as Research and Development expenses, we included these amounts in Employee Compensation and Benefit expenses within General and Administrative expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nSelling Expenses\nSelling expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional service fee to service agents and other costs incurred by our sales and marketing department such as staff costs, office supplies and other incidental expenses that are incurred directly to attract or retain consumers.\nOur selling expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $6,641,485 and $3,741,389, respectively. We recognized the marketing and promotional service expense when our service agents performed marketing activities, promotions and exhibitions for our business and products. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we recorded marketing and promotional service fee to our service agents in an amount of $5,844,846 and $2,929,080, respectively.\nConcentration of Risk\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and other receivable. As September 30, 2022 and 2021, $252,512 (RMB1,796,861) and $1,886,622 (RMB12,162,295), respectively, were deposited with various major financial institutions located in the PRC. While management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness.\nHistorically, deposits in Chinese banks are secure due to state policy to protect depositor interests. However, China promulgated a Bankruptcy Law in August 2006 that came into effect on June 1, 2007, which contains a separate article expressly stating that the State Council may promulgate implementation measures to provide for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law. Under the current Bankruptcy Law, a Chinese bank may file bankruptcy if it deems itself to be insolvent. In addition, since Chinas concession to the World Trade Organization, foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in China and have intensified competition in many aspects, especially since the opening of the Renminbi business to foreign banks in late 2006. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy at the institutions that the Company maintains deposits has increased. In the event of bankruptcy, the Company is unlikely to reclaim its deposits in full since it is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor under PRC laws.\nRisks of variable interest entity structure\nIn the opinion of management, (i) the corporate structure of the Company is in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations; (ii) the VIE Arrangements are valid and binding, and do not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (iii) the business operations of the foreign-invested enterprise and the VIE are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations in all material respects.\nHowever, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. Accordingly, the Company cannot be assured that PRC regulatory authorities will not ultimately take a contrary view to the foregoing opinion of its management. If the current corporate structure of the Company or the VIE Arrangements is found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws and regulations, the Company may be required to restructure its corporate structure and operations in the PRC to comply with changing and new PRC laws and regulations. In the opinion of management, the likelihood of loss in respect of the Companys current corporate structure or the VIE Arrangements is remote based on current facts and circumstances.\nForeign currency exchange risk\nThe value of RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions and the foreign exchange policy adopted by the PRC government. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a more flexible currency policy, which could result in greater fluctuation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. The Company is a holding company and it relies on dividends paid by the Companys operating subsidiaries in China for its cash needs. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect its liquidity and cash flows. To the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for its operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount the Company would receive. Conversely, if the Company decides to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount the Company would receive.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty raising liquid funds to meet commitments as they fall due. See our commitments and contingencies in Note 13 under Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In meeting its liquidity requirements, the Company continues to focus on increasing its revenue through the sale of consumer health care products on its online platform, King Eagle Mall, and promoting its own brand of preventive health care related products on its new online platform to reduce its costs of goods sold, streamlining its overhead costs, or obtaining financing from its stockholders or directors.\nConcentration of customers and vendors\nThere was no revenue from customers that individually represent greater than 10% of the total revenues for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, four major vendors accounted for 18%, 16%, 16% and 12% of the Companys total cost of sales.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, three major vendors accounted for 22%, 16% and 14% of the Companys total cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWe apply ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, to account for uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company follows the ASC 450-20, Contingencies to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIncome Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which modifies and eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes.

As a result of the stock split, holders of pre-split shares of common stock have the right to receive post-split shares of common stock at a ratio of ten (10) shares of post-split common stock for every one (1) share of pre-split common stock. The stock split had a record date on September 16, 2022 and an effective date on October 18, 2022. No fractional shares will be issuable as a result of the Forward Stock Split.

Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, and as a condition to the completion of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company also agreed to enter into an agreement with Wenhai Xia (the Stockholder), to cancel an aggregate of 15,535,309 shares of the Companys Common Stock owned by the Stockholder. The Reverse Acquisition was closed on May 17, 2021.\nFor accounting purpose, the transaction with KP International was treated as a reverse acquisition and KP International is deemed to be the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the historical operations that will be reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prior to the Reverse Acquisition will be those of KP International and its consolidated subsidiaries and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of KP International, and the accompanying consolidated financial statements after consummation of the reverse acquisition will include the assets and liabilities of KP International and its subsidiaries and VIE, historical operations of KP International and its subsidiaries and VIE, and operations of the Company from the Closing Date of the Reverse Acquisition. The accompanying consolidated financial statements share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the exchanged shares in the Acquisition. The equity structure of the Company was retrospectively adjusted under ASC Topic 805-40.\nRestricted net assets\nOur ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on us receiving distributions of funds from its subsidiary or VIE. Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations and after it has met the PRC requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves. Share capital of the PRC subsidiary and VIE included in the Companys consolidated net assets are also non-distributable for dividend purposes. The results of operations reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of King Eagle (China), the foreign-invested enterprise, King Eagle (Tianjin), the VIE and KP Tian Yu. The Company is required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. In addition, the Company may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund and staff bonus and welfare fund at its discretion. The statutory reserve funds and the discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nAs a result of the foregoing restrictions, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin) and KP Tian Yu are restricted in their ability to transfer their net assets to the Company. Foreign exchange and other regulation in the PRC may further restrict these two entities from transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. As of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had negative net assets which included common stock, additional paid-in capital, subscription receivable, accumulated deficit and foreign exchange translation adjustment of its subsidiaries in BVI, Hong Kong and the PRC and the VIE that are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2022, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin) and KP Tian Yu incurred negative assets in an amount of $844,025, $2,311,792 and $351, respectively. Due to the net operating loss, as of September 30, 2021, King Eagle (China), King Eagle (Tianjin) and KP Tian Yu incurred negative net assets which amounted to $1,039,840, $667,313 and nil, respectively. Accordingly, the Company did not accrue statutory reserve funds as of September 30, 2022. and 2021.\nNOTE 11- INCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the accounting standards that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Additionally, the accounting standards require the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets. The Company and its subsidiaries file separate income tax returns.\nUnited States\nKun Peng International Limited is incorporated in the State of Nevada and is subject to the United States federal income tax. No provision for income taxes in the U.S. has been made as the Company has no U.S. taxable income for the years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021.\nBritish Virgin Islands\nKP International Holding is a holding corporation organized as an International Business Company under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), and its principal operating subsidiaries are organized under the laws of Hong Kong and the laws of the PRC. KP International and its subsidiaries are not subject to income taxes in the BVI.\nHong Kong\nThe two-tier profits tax rates system was introduced under the Inland Revenue (Amendment)(No.3) Ordinance 2018 (the Ordinance) of Hong Kong became effective for the assessment year 2018/2019. Under the two-tier profit tax rates regime, the profits tax rate for the first $0.26 million (HKD 2 million) of assessable profits of a corporation will be subject to the lowered tax rate, 8.25% while the remaining assessable profits will be subject to the legacy tax rate, 16.5%. The Ordinance only allows one entity within a group of connected entities is eligible for the two-tier tax rate benefit. An entity is a connected entity of another entity if (1) one of them has control over the other; (2) both of them are under the control (more than 50% of the issued share capital) of the same entity; (3) in the case of the first entity being a natural person carrying on a sole proprietorship business-the other entity is the same person carrying on another sole proprietorship business.\nSince KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) are wholly owned and under the control of KP International Holding, these entities are connected entities. Under the Ordinance, it is an entitys election to nominate the entity that will be subject to the two-tier profits tax rates on its profits tax return. The election is irrevocable. The Company elected KP (Hong Kong) to be subject to the two-tier profits tax rates. KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) did not earn any income that was derived in Hong Kong for years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and therefore, KP Industrial and KP (Hong Kong) were not subject to Hong Kong profits tax for the periods reported.\nSince the two-tier profit tax rates regime is tentative, we applied the original profits tax rate, 16.5%, for the calculation of deferred taxes for our subsidiaries in Hong Kong.\nPRC\nThe PRCs statutory income tax rate is 25%. The Companys subsidiary and VIE registered in PRC are subject to income tax rate of 25%, unless otherwise specified.\nIncome tax expense was comprised of the following:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE BENEFIT\nSeptember 30\nCurrent $ $\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - -\nTotal current - -\nDeferred\nFederal - -\nState - -\nForeign - -\nTotal deferred - -\nTotal income tax expense $ - $ -\nA reconciliation between the Companys actual provision for income taxes and the provision at the statutory rate is as follow:\nSCHEDULE OF RECONCILIATION OF PROVISION OF INCOME TAX\nSeptember 30,\nLoss before income tax expense $ (1,972,841 ) $ (1,774,734 )\nComputed tax expense (benefit) with statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nImpact of different tax rates in other jurisdictions 3.5 % 3.2 %\nTax effect of non-deductible expenses (0.3 )% (0.7 )%\nChange in valuation allowance (24.2 )% (23.5 )%\nEffective tax rate 0 % 0 %\nDeferred tax assets included the following:\nSCHEDULE OF COMPONENTS OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax assets $ $\nNet operating loss carryforwards 922,114 668,825\nOrganizational expense\n1,216\nTotal deferred tax assets 922,114 670,041\nValuation allowance (922,114 ) (670,041 )\nTotal deferred tax assets, net $ - $ -\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had generated gross net operating loss carryforwards in an amount of $3,807,069 and $2,872,763. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, our US entity generated gross net operating loss carryforwards in an amount of $726,495 and $1,223,130, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. For net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits the Companys ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to 80% of taxable income and carryforwards the NOL indefinitely. NOLs generated prior to January 1, 2018, will not be subject to the taxable income limitation and will begin to expire in 2033 if not utilized.\nThe Companies in Hong Kong incurred gross net operating loss carryforwards in an amount of $3,548 and $2,624 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net operating loss generated in Hong Kong is carried forward indefinitely.\nOur entities in the PRC generated $3,077,026 and $1,647,009 gross net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Those net operating loss carryforwards can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce the income taxes payable of our PRC entities in those future periods and will expire in 5 years from the date they incurred if they are not used. If not utilized, approximately $208,802, $1,438,207 and $1,430,017 will be expired in the years of 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.\nAt this time, the Company considered it is more likely than not that its US, Hong Kong and PRC entities have sufficient taxable income in the near future that will allow us to realize these DTAs. Therefore, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2022, and 2021. The Company intends to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or portion of these allowances.\nNOTE 12 - RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE\nThe Company has operating leases for its office facilities and employee accommodation.
