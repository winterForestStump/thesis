We compete with mass merchants and regional chains; computer product and consumer electronics stores; other video game and PC software specialty stores; toy retail chains; direct sales by software publishers; and online retailers and game rental companies. However, we have established a presence in areas where we believe that we can take a greater portion of market share. We also compete with sellers of pre-owned and value video game products. Additionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment activities, including casual and mobile games, movies, television, theater, sporting events and family entertainment centers.\nFlooring Manufacturing Segment\nMarquis Industries, Inc.\nMarquis Industries, Inc.

In 2021, the U.S. floor covering industry had an estimated $33.7 billion in sales.\nFloor covering sales are influenced by the homeowner remodeling and residential builder markets, existing home sales and housing starts, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, the condition of residential and commercial construction, and overall strength of the economy.\nOur Market\nCarpet and Rugs\nThe carpet and rug industry had shipments of approximately $13.0 billion in 2021. The carpet and rugs industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry.

As with carpet and rugs, the market is split between residential and commercial and replacement and new construction, with residential replacement being the largest segment of the market.\nCompetition\nThe North American flooring industry is highly competitive with an increasing variety of product categories, shifting consumer preferences and pressures from imported products, particularly in the rug and hard surface categories. Marquis competes with other flooring manufacturers and resellers. Marquis is a fully integrated carpet mill, and, as a result, is able to produce carpet at the lowest cost possible for its target price point. Marquis is a one-stop shop for soft and hard surface products, allowing its customers to save time and receive exceptional service. Marquis offers innovative products and has quick turnaround times, turning a new product in two weeks from order to delivery. The principal methods of competition are service, quality, price, product innovation and technology. Marquis lean operating structure, plus investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and marketing strategy, contributes to its ability to provide exceptional value on the basis of performance, quality, style and service.\nRaw Materials and Suppliers\nWe believe that we will have access to an adequate supply of raw material on satisfactory commercial terms for the foreseeable future, as we are not dependent on any single supplier. We expect to receive adequate supply to service new and existing customers.\nCustomers\nMarquis sells products to flooring dealers, home centers, other flooring manufacturers and directly to commercial end-users.

and\ncausing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. Due to our current borrowings against our floating rate credit facilities, or if we were to increase our floating rate credit borrowings, a significant increase in interest rates generally could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of the year ended September 30, 2022, the amount of floating rate credit borrowings is approximately $51.0 million.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our Company over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries. We intend to acquire additional businesses (possibly in different sectors) in the future. Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities, will require us to add additional management personnel, and will require us to continue to upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any further expansion will also place a significant strain on our existing management, operational, and financial resources. Additionally, due to changing conditions in financial markets, financing may be more difficult to obtain at rates and terms that are acceptable to the Company.\nAlthough we currently have no material long-term need for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt (including convertible debt) or equity, depending upon the results of our operations, market conditions, or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\nthe pace of expansion of our operations;\nour response to competitive pressures; and\nfuture acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.\nThe sale of equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, fail to remediate a material weaknesses, or fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe effectiveness of any controls or procedures is subject to certain inherent limitations, and as a result, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent or detect misstatements. Even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIf we fail to remediate a material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, management could be required to expend significant resources and we could fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, and be subject to fines, penalties, investigations or judgements, all of which could negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nVarious federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters, such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules, healthcare laws and regulations (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. We could suffer losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate (as well as the federal government) have from time-to-time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, changes to paid sick leave, changes to mandatory vacation accruals, and changes to other similar requirements. These changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future.\nA significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters will likely, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. Several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increases in our prices depends on the willingness of our customers to pay higher prices and our perceived value relative to our competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wages, benefit standards, and compliance costs, which would result in higher costs for goods and services that they supply to us.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The commercially reasonable steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology.\nThird parties, including our partners, contractors, or employees may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services and the pricing of our services.\nWe may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\ncease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;\nattempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\nattempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming.\nEven if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our managements time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions.\nThe defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nData breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.\nWe store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nAlso, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our tax filings. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nWe are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert managements focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. On October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Companys Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. On August 12, 2020, three of the Companys corporate executive officers (together, the Executives) each received a Wells Notice from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Companys SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a Wells Notice from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Companys previously-disclosed SEC investigation. On August 2, 2021, the SEC Complaint was filed and, on August 13, 2021, the Sieggreen Class Action was filed. On October 1, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the SEC Complaint. The SEC filed its response opposing the motions on November 1, 2021. The defendants filed their reply responses to the SECs opposition on November 15, 2021. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the motions to dismiss.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities successfully, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, complete any such acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, or manage profitable acquired businesses or strategic investments.\nThe acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including:\nfailure of due diligence during the acquisition process;\nadverse short-term effects on reported operating results;\nthe potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction;\nthe impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings;\nthe recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\nthe diversion of managements time and resources;\nthe risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and\nthe inability properly to implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.\nOur growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial, and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we would acquire a target company after we complete due diligence.\nOur acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant write-downs of goodwill, and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements does not pass the annual goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings.\nBecause we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign, or be terminated.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key members of management at these acquired companies have been in place for several years and have established relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these key members of management for any period of time. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members of management and provided incentives to stay with the business after it has been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, which might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL SEGMENT\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell.\nSales of products by Vintage Stock are driven, in part, by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music, and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of our control, such as a decline in consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer debt levels, and inflation. These and other economic factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe video game industry is cyclical and affected by the introduction of next-generation consoles, two of which were released in Fall 2020. The introduction of these new consoles could negatively impact the demand for existing products or Vintage Stocks pre-owned business model.\nThe video game industry is cyclical in nature because of the introduction and maturation of new technology: Two new consoles were introduced in November 2020; following the introduction of the new video game consoles, sales of these consoles and related software and accessories generally increase due to initial demand, while sales of older platforms and related products generally decrease as customers migrate to the new platforms. There is a shortage of new consoles and there is no guaranty that Vintage Stock will receive any of these new consoles to sell to its customers, or, if it does receive any of these new consoles to sell, that Vintage Stock will receive enough inventory to meet customer demand. If the new video game consoles are not successful, or the developers of video games do not make games to play on these new consoles, or there are no games that the public finds interesting to play, Vintage Stocks sales of new video game products could decline. In addition, some of the new consoles are backwards compatible, meaning that games on the prior generation consoles may also be played on these new consoles. As a result, our customers may not be incentivized to sell to us or trade in their older games, resulting in less used product that we would like to obtain, which reduction could negatively impact Vintage Stocks pre-owned business and, in turn, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flow, and liquidity.\nTechnological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower Vintage Stocks sales.\nWhile it is currently possible to download video, video game content, and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other sources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or they may reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital, and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.\nVintage Stock may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular.\nListening to music, gaming, and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly, and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming are accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively.\nSales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and Vintage Stocks, and our, financial results may be adversely affected as a result.\nMany popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an M or T rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a seller of certain consumer products, Vintage Stock is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection.\nWhile Vintage Stock takes steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that they will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could have a negative impact on their respective businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Each of them may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers.\nSome of Vintage Stocks suppliers rely on foreign sources to manufacture a portion of the products or raw materials that we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to Vintage Stock, which could lower their sales and profitability and, indirectly, ours.\nIf we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.\nAll of Vintage Stocks retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, neither entity can be certain that either will be able to maintain their respective existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, neither entity may be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Their revenues and earnings may decline if they fail to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites, or find additional sites for new store expansion.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the winter and holiday selling season could impact our financial results.\nOur retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of Vintage Stocks sales realized around various holidays and other days, including Black Friday, Presidents Day, tax refund season, Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day. Any adverse trend in sales during these times could negatively impact their results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nResults of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nVintage Stocks results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nthe timing and allocations of new product releases;\nthe timing of new store openings or closings;\nshifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings;\nthe effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating;\nacquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and\nthe costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores.\nThese and other factors could affect their respective businesses, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\nFailure to manage our new store openings effectively could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon Vintage Stock opening new stores and operating them profitably. Their ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to:\nidentify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\nhire and train skilled associates;\nintegrate new stores into existing operations; and\nincrease sales at new store locations.\nIf we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.\nIf our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.\nWe rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores enables us to meet peak demand and replenish our stores to keep them in stock at optimum levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to perform these functions adequately, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have previously recorded significant goodwill as a result of our acquisition of Vintage Stock. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys flooring manufacturing business.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there may be additional downturns in the future that could cause the industry to deteriorate. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMarquis may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.\nMarquis operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to respond quickly and effectively to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nMarquis faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower its prices, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. Marquis faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors, many of whom have more resources than it. Maintaining its competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force it to lower its prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar, combined with lower fuel costs, may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with Marquis products, which may put pressure on its pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nIn periods of rising costs, Marquis may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although Marquis generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy, and fuel-related costs to its customers, its ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures, and market conditions for its products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STEEL MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe demand for steel manufacturing segment's products may decrease if manufacturing in North America declines or if automakers, who manufacture their products in the U.S., do not introduce new models or their sales decline.\nThe products manufactured by our steel manufacturing segment typically follow the North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing cycle, with a large emphasis on automotive manufacturing. If North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing is transferred offshore, then the need for our products to make tools and dies will decrease, which will have a negative impact on the steel manufacturing segments business, financial condition (including, without limitation, its liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we rely heavily on the sale of our products to automakers who purchase our products when they retool production lines in connection with the introduction of new models. If those automakers do not introduce a new model in any given year, our sales may decrease which will have a negative impact on our business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nOur steel manufacturing segment and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials in a timely manner, and sometimes at all, due to a limited number of suppliers, delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, force majeure events (including public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and general national supply chain issues), shortages, or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties, as well as supply and logistics constraints moving its own raw materials to its plants. In addition, if the already limited number of suppliers consolidate, it would limit our steel manufacturing segments negotiating power for raw material purchases.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, purchase raw materials from sources even when they are at above market prices. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our steel manufacturing segments profit margins could temporarily be reduced, as higher cost inventory is turned over.\nShortages of qualified and trainable labor, increased labor costs, or our steel manufacturing segments failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur steel manufacturing segment depends on skilled or trainable drug-free labor for the manufacture of its products. Its continued success depends on the active participation of its key employees. Our steel manufacturing segment, like other companies that reply on a trained blue-collar workforce, receives pressure from other manufacturers regarding the labor pool. Our steel manufacturing segment, aside from competing with other manufacturers, also competes with non-industrial blue-collar professions for labor. Should a significant employer move into our geographical area, such employer could draw from the current labor pool and require a substantial increase in training expense.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages, and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur steel manufacturing segment has adjusted its business model over time to utilize its equipment and manufacturing facility fully. Production depends on running at a moderate rate of capacity. Outages due to power outages, weather, pandemics (including the Covid-19 pandemic), or machine outages affect its capability to produce at the level necessary to meet customer demand or at all.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances, such as union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. Our steel manufacturing segment is also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers, such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nOur production and distribution workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nPrecision Marshalls manufacturing employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steelworkers and its warehouse and distribution workforce employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the International Association of Aeronautical and Machinists. These agreements were successfully renegotiated during 2021 without a work stoppage, and were extended through September 2026 and April 2026, respectively. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect Precision Marshalls operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses and, indirectly, ours.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations\nOur steel manufacturing segments business depends on the transportation of a large number of products. It relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products, as well as delivery of its raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry, or otherwise, may adversely affect our steel manufacturing segments results of operations, as it may not be able to pass such cost increases on to its customers.\nIf any of these transportation service providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, it might be unable to manufacture and deliver its products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, it might be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost or at any cost, as there are a limited number of suppliers worldwide for our steel manufacturing segments raw materials.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our steel manufacturing segment's reputation, negatively affect its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nWe face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies\nOur steel manufacturing segments business depends on manufacturing products in North America. If tariffs were to rise disproportionally on raw materials compared to finished tools, we would be at risk for manufacturers to cease purchasing the products from it and instead purchasing products from third parties who are not subject to such tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and/or policies.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. Our steel manufacturing segment has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more viable results during periods of economic and market downturns; but, this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our steel manufacturing segments business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. Precision Marshall sells to distributors, who, in turn, sell to the automotive, appliance, defense, and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns, or volatility in any of the markets served could adversely affect our steel manufacturing segments financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks, which may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nThe purchase of raw material and certain necessary equipment are transactions that often take place with foreign countries. The weakening of the of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro negatively affects the price that Precision Marshall pays for raw materials and equipment. Volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on Precision Marshalls reported financial results and condition and, indirectly, ours.\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain state and local requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail additional costs for additional systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, our steel manufacturing segment outsources all disposal of waste material, non-compliance by third party providers could result in additional costs to defend environmental claims or additional costs to replace the outsourced entities.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that our steel manufacturing segment will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits it currently holds. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future raw materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nPrecision Marshall relies on raw material sources in the EU and U.S. Tightening of those requirements in the EU and/or sources in the U.S. could deter steel produces from producing the raw material for our products or result in significant price increases of our raw material.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nAdverse developments in our ongoing proceeding or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or stock price.\nWe may be subject to investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, enforcement actions, bars against serving as an officer or director, or practicing before the SEC, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or members of our senior management.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Our insurance, to the extent maintained, may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or our stock price. Any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our stakeholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our image.\nDue to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 8, 2022, Isaac Capital Group LLC (ICG), together with Jon Isaac, our President and CEO and the President and sole member of ICG, control approximately 50.2% of the outstanding voting power of our company (assuming the exercise of all outstanding and exercisable warrants held by them). Jon Isaac has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG. As a result, Jon Isaac, both individually and through ICG, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain stockholder approval, including the election of directors to our Board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than your purchase price for your shares.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nCertain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.\nWe are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10% or more of the corporations voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following:\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval;\nstockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting;\nall stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors;\nspecial meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our Company;\na director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors;\nour Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws;\nnewly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and\ncumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors.\nThese provisions of Nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.

Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur Common Stock\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol LIVE.\nThe following table sets forth the quarterly high and low trading prices per share of our common stock during the last two fiscal years.\nQuarter Ended\nHigh ($)\nLow ($)\nOctober 1 - December 31, 2020\n$\n13.90\n$\n7.93\nJanuary 1 - March 31, 2021\n$\n36.00\n$\n11.50\nApril 1 - June 30, 2021\n$\n75.25\n$\n23.65\nJuly 1 - September 30, 2021\n$\n66.48\n$\n24.84\nOctober 1 - December 31, 2021\n$\n45.20\n$\n29.13\nJanuary 1 - March 31, 2022\n$\n45.00\n$\n23.74\nApril 1 - June 30, 2022\n$\n43.87\n$\n23.37\nJuly 1 - September 30, 2022\n$\n36.80\n$\n23.82\nHolders of Record\nAs of September 30, 2022, there were (i) 197 holders of record of our common stock, (ii) 29 holders of record of our Series E Preferred Stock, and (iii) no holders of record of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock). We have no record of the number of holders of our common stock who hold their shares in street name with various brokers.\nDividend Policy\nWe have two classes of authorized preferred stock. As of September 30, 2022, our Series E Preferred Stock had 47,840 shares issued and outstanding. Each share of Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to and receives a dividend of $0.015 per year. During the year ending September 30, 2022, dividends of approximately $720 were paid to holders of Series E Preferred Stock. At September 30, 2022, the Company had accrued and unpaid preferred stock dividends totaling an aggregate of approximately $200.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our Series B Preferred Stock had no shares issued and outstanding. Our Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to receive a dividend in the aggregate amount of $1.00 to be allocated on a pro rata basis among all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of such Series, if, when, and as our Board of Directors shall have declared it. The Board of Directors shall not declare, pay or set aside any dividends on shares of any other class or series of capital stock of our Company unless that $1.00 dividend has been declared and paid.\nPresently, we do not pay dividends on shares of our common stock or shares of our Series B Preferred Stock. Our declaration and payment of cash dividends in the future and the amount thereof will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, prospects, limitations imposed by credit agreements and/or indentures governing debt securities and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company announced a $10 million common stock repurchase plan. In October 2020, our Board of Directors approved an extension of the term of the repurchase plan from February 15, 2021 to June 1, 2021, and in March 2021 further extended the term of the repurchase plan from June 1, 2021 to June 1 2024.

ITEM 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable. ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies and an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the year ended September 30, 2022, this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (hereafter referred to as MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 (this Form 10-K).\nNote about Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are often characterized by the terms may, believes, projects, intends, plans, expects, or anticipates, and do not reflect historical facts.\nSpecific forward-looking statements contained in this portion of the Annual Report include, but are not limited to: (i) statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, (ii) statements about current projections and expectations of general economic conditions, (iii) statements about specific industry projections and expectations of economic activity, (iv) statements relating to our future operations, prospects, results, and performance, (v) statements about the Chapter 11 Case, (vi) statements that the cash on hand and additional cash generated from operations together with potential sources of cash through issuance of debt or equity will provide the Company with sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months, and (vii) statements that the outcome of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on business, financial position and results of operations, cash flow or liquidity.\nForward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. This Form 10-K identifies those factors and risks that could affect our results, our future performance, and our capital requirements under Item 1A Risk Factors. There are also other factors that we are currently unable to identify or quantify, but that may exist in the future, that could similarly affect us.\nIn addition, any or all of the factors identified in this Form 10-K may generally affect our business, results of operations, and financial position. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. We do not undertake and specifically decline any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Any information contained on our website, www.liveventures.com, or any other websites referenced in this Annual Report, are not part of this Annual Report.\nOur Company\nLive Ventures Incorporated is a holding company of diversified businesses, which, together with our subsidiaries, we refer to as the Company, Live Ventures, we, us or our. We acquire and operate companies in various industries that have historically demonstrated a strong history of earnings power. We currently have three segments to our business: Retail, Flooring Manufacturing, Steel Manufacturing, and Corporate & Other.\nUnder the Live Ventures brand, we seek opportunities to acquire profitable and well-managed companies. We work closely with consultants who help us identify target companies that fit within the criteria we have established for opportunities that will provide synergies with our businesses.\nOur principal offices are located at 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119, our telephone number is (702) 939-0231, and our corporate website (which does not form part of this report Form 10-K) is located at www.liveventures.com. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol LIVE.\nRetail Segment\nOur Retail Segment is composed of Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart.\nVintage Stock\nVintage Stock Holdings LLC, Vintage Stock, V-Stock, Movie Trading Company and EntertainMart (collectively, Vintage Stock) is an award-winning specialty entertainment retailer that offers a large selection of entertainment products, including new and pre-owned movies, video games and music products, as well as ancillary products, such as books, comics, toys and collectibles, in a single location.

The bankruptcy affected Live Ventures indirect subsidiary ApplianceSmart only and did not affect any other subsidiary of Live Ventures, or Live Ventures itself. On February 28, 2022, the court approved ApplianceSmarts plan for reorganization (the Plan), discharging ApplianceSmart of certain debts according to the Plan resulting in the Company recording a gain of approximately $11.4 million, which includes a write-off or adjustment of approximately $11.5 million on the settlement of debts and other liabilities, offset by payments subject to the bankruptcy that were not included as debtor-in-possession liabilities of approximately $149,000. As of April 1, 2022, we have ceased operations of its one existing location, and are in the process of winding down operations, which will be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nFlooring Manufacturing Segment\nOur Flooring Manufacturing segment is comprised of Marquis.\nMarquis Affiliated Holdings LLC and wholly-owned subsidiaries (Marquis).

Marquiss state-of-the-art operations enable high quality products, unique customization, and exceptionally short lead-times. Furthermore, the Company has recently invested in additional capacity to grow several attractive lines of business, including printed carpet and yarn extrusion.\nOn July 1, 2022, Live acquired certain assets and intellectual property of Better Backers, a Georgia corporation, which was accomplished through an Asset Purchase Agreement.\nSteel Manufacturing Segment\nOur Steel Manufacturing segment is comprised of Precision Industries, Inc. (Precision Marshall), and its wholly-owned subsidiary The Kinetic Co., Inc. (Kinetic).\nPrecision Marshall is the North American leader in providing and manufacturing, pre-finished de-carb free tool and die steel. For nearly 75 years, Precision Marshall has served steel distributors through quick and accurate service. Precision Marshall has led the industry with exemplary availability and value-added processing that saves distributors time and processing costs.\nFounded in 1948, Precision Marshall The Deluxe Company has built a reputation of high integrity, speed of service and doing things the Deluxe Way. The term Deluxe refers to all aspects of the product and customer service to be head and shoulders above the rest. From order entry to packaging and delivery, Precision Marshall makes it easy to do business and backs all products and service with a guarantee.\nPrecision Marshall provides four key products to over 500 steel distributors in four product categories: Deluxe Alloy Plate, Deluxe Tool Steel Plate, Precision Ground Flat Stock, and Drill Rod.

Kinetic was founded by the Masters family in 1948 and is headquartered in Greendale, Wisconsin. Kinetic manufactures more than 90 types of knives and numerous associated parts with modifications and customizations available to each. Kinetic employs approximately 100 non-union employees.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Preparation of these statements requires us to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant and material impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are based on management's experience and other information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Our actual realized results may differ materially from managements initial estimates as reported. Our critical and significant accounting policies include Trade and Other Receivables, Inventories, Goodwill, Revenue Recognition, Fair Value Measurements, Stock Based Compensation, Income Taxes, Segment Reporting and Concentrations of Credit Risk.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe evaluate the performance of our operations based on financial measures such as revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the business, including the business ability to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures, and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate a companys financial performance, subject to certain adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by GAAP, and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by Live Ventures Incorporated, should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain statement of income items and as a percentage of revenue, for the periods indicated (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSelected Data:\nRevenues\n$\n286,913\n$\n272,981\nCost of revenues\n189,086\n173,518\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n54,531\n52,246\nSales and marketing expenses\n12,459\n11,427\nImpairment expense\n4,910\n-\nInterest expense, net\n4,209\n5,205\nProvision for income taxes\n6,875\n8,662\nNet income\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,017\nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\nRetail business\n$\n14,054\n$\n18,173\nFlooring Manufacturing business\n17,043\n23,744\nSteel Manufacturing business\n10,230\n6,615\nCorporate and Other\n(2,943\n)\n(4,009\n)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n38,384\n$\n44,523\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue\nRetail business\n16.3\n%\n20.5\n%\nFlooring Manufacturing business\n13.0\n%\n18.2\n%\nSteel Manufacturing business\n16.9\n%\n13.4\n%\nCorporate and Other\n-31.7\n%\n-86.9\n%\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue\n13.4\n%\n16.3\n%\nThe following table sets forth revenues by segment (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nNet\n% of Total\nNet\n% of Total\nRevenue\nRevenue\nRevenue\nTotal Revenue\nRevenues\nRetail\n$\n86,156\n30.0\n%\n$\n88,845\n32.5\n%\nFlooring manufacturing\n130,850\n45.6\n%\n130,223\n47.7\n%\nSteel manufacturing\n60,617\n21.1\n%\n49,302\n18.1\n%\nCorporate and other\n9,290\n3.2\n%\n4,611\n1.7\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n286,913\n100.0\n%\n$\n272,981\n100.0\n%\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by segment (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nGross\nGross Profit\n%\nGross\nGross Profit\n%\nProfit\nof Total\nRevenue\nProfit\nof Total\nRevenue\nGross Profit\nRetail\n$\n45,583\n15.9\n%\n$\n48,059\n17.6\n%\nFlooring manufacturing\n31,908\n11.1\n%\n37,893\n13.9\n%\nSteel manufacturing\n16,878\n5.9\n%\n11,954\n4.4\n%\nCorporate and other\n3,458\n1.2\n%\n1,557\n0.6\n%\nTotal Gross Profit\n$\n97,827\n34.1\n%\n$\n99,463\n36.4\n%\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by approximately $13.9 million to approximately $286.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 of approximately $273.0 million.\nRetail segment revenue decreased by approximately $2.7 million, or 3.0%, to approximately $86.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $88.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Movies, Music, Games and Other revenue decreased by approximately $1.9 million, which was primarily due to reduced demand resulting from inflationary pressures, supply chain issues, and overall product sales mix. Appliance revenue decreased by approximately $796,000 due to the shutdown of operations as discussed above.\nFlooring Manufacturing revenue increased by approximately $627,000, or 0.5%, to approximately $130.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to approximately $130.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was due to the passing on of product cost increases to customers, as well as the acquisition of Better Backers in July 2022.\nSteel Manufacturing revenue increased by approximately $11.3 million, or 23.0%, to approximately $60.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to approximately $49.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to passing on product cost increases to customers, as well as the acquisition of Kinetic during June 2022 (see Note 5 below).\nCorporate and Other revenue increased by approximately $4.7 million, or 101.5%, to approximately $9.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to approximately $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is due to the addition of SW Financial as a VIE during June 2021.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues increased by approximately $15.6 million, or 9.0% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues was 65.9% for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 63.6% for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the increases in revenues, as well as increased product costs due to inflationary pressures.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and Administrative expense increased by approximately $2.3 million or 4.4%, for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to the acquisition of Kinetic in June 2022, increases in employee compensation and related costs as a result of our Retail segment opening new locations, the consolidation of SW Financial in June 2021, partially offset by reductions in legal and other professional fees.\nSelling and Marketing Expense\nSelling and marketing expense increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to increased convention and trade show activity, which was largely canceled in fiscal 2021 due to COVID, as well as compensation associated with the Marquis sales force.\nLoss on Impairment of Intangibles and Goodwill\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, in connection with quantitative impairment testing performed on SW Financial, we recorded a $4.9 million charge for impairment of intangibles and goodwill. This amount includes approximately $3.7 million for full impairment of goodwill, and approximately $1.2 million in partial impairment of customer relationships and trade names.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net decreased by approximately $1.0 million or 19.1%, for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to the payoff of higher interest rate debt and fully amortizing related debt discount during the year ended September 30, 2021, as well as favorable interest rates obtained from Precision's credit facility refinancing (see Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements), and the capitalization of interest charges by our Flooring Manufacturing segment during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nGain on Payroll Protection Program\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a gain of approximately $6.2 million due to the forgiveness of PPP Loans. There were no similar transactions during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nGain on Bankruptcy Settlement\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of approximately $11.4 million due to the discharge of certain obligations relating to the ApplianceSmart bankruptcy as discussed above. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1.8 million due to the discharge of certain payables from bankruptcy proceedings.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded an income tax provision of approximately $6.9 million, compared to a tax provision of approximately $8.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The year over year decrease is primarily due to a bankruptcy gain exclusion, in the amount of $2.8 million, applicable to the gain recorded in connection with the ApplianceSmart bankruptcy.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nThe following table sets forth the results of operations by segment (in $000s):\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nYear Ended September 30, 2021\nFlooring\nSteel\nCorporate &\nFlooring\nSteel\nCorporate &\nRetail\nManufacturing\nManufacturing\nOther\nTotal\nRetail\nManufacturing\nManufacturing\nOther\nTotal\nRevenues\n$\n86,156\n$\n130,850\n$\n60,617\n$\n9,290\n$\n286,913\n$\n88,845\n$\n130,223\n$\n49,302\n$\n4,611\n$\n272,981\nCost of Revenue\n40,573\n98,942\n43,739\n5,832\n189,086\n40,786\n92,330\n37,348\n3,054\n173,518\nGross Profit\n45,583\n31,908\n16,878\n3,458\n97,827\n48,059\n37,893\n11,954\n1,557\n99,463\nGeneral and\nAdministrative\nExpense\n32,312\n6,522\n7,444\n8,253\n54,531\n31,131\n7,614\n5,558\n7,943\n52,246\nSelling and Marketing\nExpense\n11,232\n12,459\n10,076\n11,427\nImpairment Expense\n-\n-\n-\n4,910\n4,910\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nOperating Income\n(Loss)\n$\n12,628\n$\n14,154\n$\n8,866\n$\n(9,721\n)\n$\n25,927\n$\n16,340\n$\n20,203\n$\n5,869\n$\n(6,622\n)\n$\n35,790\nRetail Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 decreased by approximately $2.7 million, or 3.0%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reduced demand partially offset by price increases as a result of inflationary factors and supply chain issues, offset by increased retail pricing and additional locations added at Vintage Stock. Further, as of April 2022, ApplianceSmart shutdown operations. Retail sales at our Vintage Stock locations during the year ended September 30, 2021 benefitted from increased consumer discretional spending resulting from one-time stimulus payments in 2021. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 47.1% for the year ended September 30, 2022, as opposed to 45.9% for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase is due to inflationary pressures and product mix. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.2 million, and is primarily attributable to inflationary cost pressures and new stores opened in fiscal year 2022. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately $12.6 million, as compared to approximately $16.3 million during the prior year period primarily due to those factors discussed above.\nFlooring Manufacturing Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased moderately as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increases in sales prices that were passed on to customers, partially offset by an overall reduction in consumer demand, as well as the acquisition of Better Backers in July 2022. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 75.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022, as opposed to 70.9% for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increases in raw material costs, as compared to the prior year. General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $1.1 million primarily due to one-time expenses incurred during the year ended September 30, 2021, and a reduction of variable employee compensation costs recognized during the year ended September 30, 2022. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.2 million primarily due to increased convention and trade show activity, as well as increased compensation associated with the Marquis sales force. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately $14.0 million, as compared to operating income of approximately $20.2 million for the prior year period.\nSteel Manufacturing Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased by approximately $11.3 million, or 23%, as compared to the prior year, due to increased sales prices resulting from passing on product cost increases to customers, as well as the acquisition of Kinetic during June 2022. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 72.2% for the year ended September 30, 2022, as opposed to 75.8% for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease is due to improved manufacturing efficiencies, increased revenue due to price increases, and the acquisition of Kinetic. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1.9 million, or 33.9%, primarily due to an increase in\ncompensation costs, as well as the acquisition of Kinetic. Operating income was approximately $9.0 million and approximately $5.9 million, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCorporate and Other Segment\nResults for Corporate and Other includes our directory services business and our investment in SW Financial. Revenues for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased by approximately $4.7 million primarily due to the addition of SW Financial as a VIE during June 2021. Cost of revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased proportionately with revenue due to inflationary pressures and the consolidation of SW Financial in June 2021. Operating loss for the year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately $9.7 million, as compared to a loss of approximately $6.6 million in the prior year. Revenues and operating income for our directory services business continue to decline due to decreasing renewals. We expect revenue and operating income from this segment to continue to decrease in the future. We are no longer accepting new customers in our directory services business.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net income for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nNet income\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,017\nDepreciation and amortization\n7,168\n6,791\nStock-based compensation\nInterest expense, net\n4,209\n5,205\nIncome tax expense\n6,875\n8,662\nGain on bankruptcy settlement\n(11,352\n)\n(1,765\n)\nGain/loss on extinguishment of debt\n(6,150\n)\nNon-recurring loan costs\n-\nAcquisition costs\n1,470\n-\nWrite-off of fixed assets\n-\nImpairment of goodwill and intangibles\n4,910\n-\nOther non-recurring noncash items\n(196\n)\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n38,384\n$\n44,523\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $6.1 million, or 13.8%, for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the prior year period. The decrease is primarily due to decreases in revenue and gross profit, as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nBased on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our asset-based revolver lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, pay our scheduled loan payments, allow for the repurchase of shares under our share buyback program, and pay dividends on our shares of Series E Preferred Stock as declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have the following three asset-based revolver lines of credit: (i) Texas Capital Bank Revolver Loan (TCB Revolver) utilized by Vintage Stock, (ii) Bank of America Revolver Loan (BofA Revolver) utilized by Marquis, and (iii) Fifth Third Revolver Loan (Fifth Third Revolver) utilized by Precision Marshall. Additionally, we have an unsecured revolving line of credit with Isaac Capital Group (ICG Revolver), a related party, which is utilized by the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had total cash and restricted cash of approximately $4.6 million as well as approximately $26.4 million of available borrowing under our revolving credit facilities. The Company's restricted cash of approximately $890,000 is required collateral for a standby letter of credit for a customs bond, which is renewed annually. As we continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Companys cash and restricted cash at September 30, 2022 was approximately $4.6 million compared to approximately $4.7 million at September 30, 2021, a decrease of approximately $100,000. Net cash provided by operations was approximately $14.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to net cash provided by operations of approximately $29.2 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to purchases of inventory and the timing of payments of income taxes and trade accounts payable.\nOur primary sources of cash inflows are from customer receipts from sales on account, factored accounts receivable proceeds, receipts for securities sales commissions, and net remittances from directory services customers processed in the form of ACH billings. Our most significant cash outflows include payments for raw materials and general operating expenses, including payroll costs and general and administrative expenses that typically occur within close proximity of expense recognition.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities of approximately $40.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and our acquisitions of Kinetic and Better Backers. Our cash flows used in investing activities of approximately $17.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 consisted of purchases of property and equipment and our investment in SW Financial.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $25.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily consisted in net proceeds from revolver loans of approximately $21.6 million, and approximately $17.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, partially offset by payments on notes payable and finance leases of approximately $10.6 million, and purchases of treasury stock of approximately $2.7 million. Proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans and the issuance of notes payable was primarily associated with the acquisition of Kinetic.\nOur cash flows used in financing activities of approximately $16.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily consisted of approximately $16.8 million for payments of notes payable, approximately $1.4 million in net payments under revolver loans, and approximately $421,000 for the purchase of treasury stock, partially offset by the issuance of notes payable of approximately of $2.3 million from proceeds received from the issuance of notes payable, and proceeds of approximately $323,000 from stock options exercised.\nCurrently, the Company is not issuing common shares for liquidity purposes. We prefer to use asset-based lending arrangements and mezzanine financing together with Company provided capital to finance acquisitions and have done so historically. Occasionally, as our Company history has demonstrated, we will issue stock and derivative instruments linked to stock for services and/or debt settlement.\nWorking Capital\nWe had working capital of approximately $78.4 million as of September 30, 2022 as compared to approximately $33.8 million as of September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the net assets received from the acquisitions of Kinetic and Better Backers, increases in accounts receivable and inventories, and decreases in debtor-in-possession\nliabilities and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in the current portion of long-term debt and the current portion of operating lease obligations.\nFuture Sources of Cash; New Products and Services\nWe may require additional debt financing or capital to finance new acquisitions, refinance existing indebtedness or other strategic investments in our business. Other sources of financing may include stock issuances and additional loans; or other forms of financing. Any financing obtained may further dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations consisting of operating lease agreements and debt obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our future liquidity and cash flows (in $000's):\nPayments due by Period\nLess Than\nOne Year\nOne to Three\nYears\nThree to Five\nYears\nMore Than\nFive Years\nTotal\nNotes payable\n$\n18,935\n$\n18,075\n$\n35,609\n$\n9,646\n$\n82,265\nNotes Payable - related party\n2,000\n2,000\n-\n-\n4,000\nLease obligations\n11,998\n19,385\n14,001\n91,435\n136,819\nTotal\n$\n32,933\n$\n39,460\n$\n49,610\n$\n101,081\n$\n223,084\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt September 30, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, commitments or guarantees that require additional disclosure or measurement. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not participate in any market risk-sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required. We believe we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases or commodity price risk. ITEM 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data\nLIVE VENTURES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContents\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Frazier & Deeter, LLC (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ID: 215)\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Income for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity for years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nLive Ventures Incorporated\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Live Ventures Incorporated (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP).\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAs described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, Precision Marshall, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of The Kinetic Co., Inc. (Kinetic) and also entered into a real estate purchase agreement pursuant to which Precision received all of Kinetic's rights, titles, and interests in and to the land and improvements. The combined purchase price was approximately $25.0 million. As part of its purchase price allocation, the Company determined $1.0 million should be allocated to customer relationship and trade name intangible assets and approximately $12.9 million to property, plant and equipment (collectively intangibles and fixed assets).\nWe identified the Companys valuation of Kinetics intangibles and fixed assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the estimate of the preliminary acquisition date fair value, including forecasts of future revenues and expenses and the selection of the discount rates. Auditing managements forecasts of future revenues and expenses as well as the selection of the discount rates involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of our valuation specialists, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the acquired intangibles and fixed assets.\nOur audit procedures related to the Companys estimate of the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the intangibles and fixed assets included the following, among others:\nWe read the purchase agreements to understand and evaluate the terms of the transaction to determine that the acquisition met the requirements of a business combination.\nWe evaluated the analysis of the initial allocation of the purchase price accounting as well as the determination of the balance sheet classification of each component of the transaction.\nWe obtained the Companys third-party expert valuation report to gain an understanding of the processes and key assumptions for estimating the fair value of intangible assets and other acquired assets and liabilities.\nWe have tested the funds flow of the transactions and vouched appropriate proceeds and payments.\nWe utilized our valuation specialists to evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the methodologies and assumptions, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the discount rate, used by the Companys third-party valuation expert in developing the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, fixed assets and other assets and liabilities.\nWe assessed the reasonableness of managements cash flow forecasts based on historical results, price increases and expected inflation.\nWe performed independent calculations to test the reasonableness and mathematical accuracy of the fair values concluded on by the Company.\nWe evaluated the qualifications of the Companys third-party valuation expert based on credentials, reputation and experience.\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\n/s/ Frazier & Deeter, LLC\nAtlanta,

VENTURES INCORPORATED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nNote 1: Background and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Live Ventures Incorporated, a Nevada corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, Live Ventures or the Company). Live Ventures is a diversified holding company with a strategic focus on value-oriented acquisitions of domestic middle-market companies. The Company has four operating segments: Retail, Flooring Manufacturing, Steel Manufacturing, and Corporate and Other. The Retail segment includes (i) Vintage Stock, Inc. (Vintage Stock), which is engaged in the retail sale of new and used movies, music, collectibles, comics, books, games, game systems and components and (ii) ApplianceSmart, Inc. (ApplianceSmart), which, until April 1, 2022 when the Company ceased operations, was engaged in the sale of new major appliances through a retail store (see Note 15). The Flooring Manufacturing segment included Marquis Industries, Inc. (Marquis), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of carpet and the sale of vinyl and wood floorcoverings. The Steel Manufacturing Segment includes Precision Industries, Inc. (Precision Marshall), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of alloy and steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods.\nNote 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, and a variable interest entity (VIE). The Company records a non-controlling interest within stockholders equity for the portion of the entitys equity attributed to the consolidated entities that are not wholly owned. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These reclassifications have no material effect on the reported financial results.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates made in connection with the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the estimated reserve for doubtful current and long-term trade and other receivables, the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, estimated warranty reserve, fair values in connection with the analysis of goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived assets for impairment, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, lease terminations, and estimated useful lives for intangible assets and property and equipment.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, advances to affiliates and obligations under accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables, leases, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term notes payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the long-term debt is calculated based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Companys existing debt arrangements, unless quoted market prices are available (Level 2 inputs). The carrying amounts of long-term debt at September 30, 2022 and 2021 approximate fair value.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Fair value of cash equivalents and restricted cash approximates carrying value. The Company's restricted cash is required collateral for a standby letter of credit for a customs bond, which is renewed annually. The restricted cash balance is included in the cash balance on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company's restricted cash balance was approximately $890,000 and $735,000, respectively.\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company grants trade credit to customers under credit terms that it believes are customary in the industries in which it operates and does not require collateral to support customer trade receivables. Some of the Companys trade receivables are factored primarily through two factors. Factored trade receivables are sold without recourse for substantially all of the receivables balances for credit approved accounts. The factor purchases the trade receivable(s) for the gross amount of the respective invoice(s), less factoring commissions, trade and cash discounts. The factor charges the Company a factoring commission for each trade account, which is between 0.45-0.50% of the gross amount of the invoice(s) factored on the date of the purchase, plus an additional rate of 0.0125% for each credit term extension of 30 days, or portion thereof. The minimum annual commission due the factor is approximately $200,000 per contract year.\nThe following table details the Company's trade receivables as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 ($000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nTrade receivables, net:\nAccounts receivable\n$\n25,797\n$\n21,620\nLess: Reserve for doubtful accounts\n(132\n)\n(61\n)\n$\n25,665\n$\n21,559\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes allowances for accounts and factored trade receivables, customer refunds, dilution and fees from local exchange carrier billing aggregators and other uncollectible accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical bad debt experience and periodic evaluations of the aging and collectability of the trade receivables. This allowance is maintained at a level which the Company believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and trade receivables are only written off to bad debt expense as uncollectible after all reasonable collection efforts have been made. The Company has also purchased accounts receivable credit insurance to cover some non-factored trade and other receivables which helps reduce potential losses due to doubtful accounts. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $132,000 and $61,000, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of the inventorys cost (first in, first out basis or FIFO) or net realizable value of the inventory. Management compares the cost of inventory with its net realizable value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to net realizable value, if lower. Management also reviews inventory to determine if excess or obsolete inventory is present and a reserve is made to reduce the carrying value for inventory for such excess and or obsolete inventory. At years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the inventory reserves were approximately $2.4 million and $1.8 million, respectively.\nThe following table details the Company's inventories as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 ($000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nInventory, net\nRaw materials\n$\n35,829\n$\n18,604\nWork in progress\n7,539\n12,404\nFinished goods\n32,814\n22,584\nMerchandise\n23,900\n18,948\n100,082\n72,540\nLess: Inventory reserves\n(2,423\n)\n(1,793\n)\n$\n97,659\n$\n70,747\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives of building and improvements are three to 40 years, transportation equipment is five to 10 years, machinery and equipment are three to 10 years, furnishings and fixtures are three to five years, and office and computer equipment are three to five years.\nThe Company periodically reviews its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including its intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected discounted cash flows.\nGoodwill\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Under ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of business acquired.\nThe Company tests goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events arise or circumstances change that indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed, as required by ASC 350, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists.\nThe quantitative test is used to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit's assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Company's reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of the future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. A goodwill impairment test is required to be completed, at minimum, once annually, and any resulting impairment loss recorded upon completion of the assessment. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments.\nWhen performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company's methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company's cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method (DCF). These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses. Factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses, the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development, the future cost structure of the businesses, and future technological changes. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Companys intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles, favorable leases, trade names, licenses for the use of internet domain names, Universal Resource Locators, or URLs, software, and marketing and technology related intangibles. Upon acquisition, estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets, which include but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; tradename and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining the fair values. All intangible assets are capitalized at their original cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows: domain name and marketing - three to 20 years; software - three to 5 years, customer relationships - seven to 15 years, favorable leases - over the life of the lease, customer lists - to 20 years, trade names - to 20 years.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nThe Company accounts for its sales revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 provides a five-step revenue recognition model that is applied to the Companys customer contracts. Under this model we (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price for the contract, (iv) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (v) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised goods or the performance of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company enters into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nRetail Segment\nThe Retail Segment derives revenue primarily from direct sales of entertainment and appliance products and services, including shipping and handling amounts, which are recognized when the following requirements have been met: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales transaction price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title or use rights, ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, (iv) allocation of sales price to specific performance obligations, and (v) performance obligations are satisfied. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes collected from customers. All direct costs are either paid and or accrued for in the period in which the sale is recorded.\nFlooring and Steel Manufacturing Segments\nThe Flooring Manufacturing Segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of carpet and hard surface flooring products, including shipping and handling amounts. The Steel Manufacturing Segments derives revenue primarily from the sale of steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods, including shipping and handling amounts. Revenue is recognized when the following requirements have been met: (i) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, (ii) the sales transaction price is fixed or determinable, (iii) title, ownership and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, (iv) allocation of sales price to specific performance obligations, and (v) performance obligations are satisfied. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized. Revenues are recorded net of taxes collected from customers. All direct costs are either paid and or accrued for in the period in which the sale is recorded.\nSpare Parts\nFor spare parts sales, the Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when it ships the product to the customer or when the customer receives product based upon agreed shipping terms. Each unit sold is considered an independent, unbundled performance obligation. The Company has no additional performance obligations other than spare parts sales that are material in the context of the contract. The amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies due to sales incentives and returns offered to customers. When customers retain the right to return eligible products, the Company reduces revenue for the estimate of the expected returns, which is primarily based on an analysis of historical experience.\nWarranties\nWarranties are classified as either assurance or service type warranties. A warranty is considered an assurance type warranty if it provides the consumer with assurance that the product will function as intended. A warranty that goes above and beyond ensuring basic functionality is considered a service type warranty. The Company offers certain limited warranties that are assurance type warranties and extended service arrangements that are service type warranties. Assurance type warranties are not accounted for as separate performance obligations under the revenue model. If a service type warranty is sold with a product or separately, revenue is recognized over the life of the warranty. The Company evaluates warranty offerings in comparison to industry standards and market expectations to determine appropriate warranty classification. Industry standards and market expectations are determined by jurisdictional laws, competitor offerings and customer expectations. Market expectations and industry standards can vary based on product type and geography. The Company primarily offers assurance type warranties.\nA warranty reserve of approximately $35,000 and $105,000 is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company classifies shipping and handling charged to customers as revenues and classifies costs relating to shipping and handling as cost of revenues.\nCustomer Liabilities\nThe Company recognizes the portion of the dollar value of prepaid stored-value products that ultimately is unredeemed (breakage) in accordance with ASU 2016-04 Liabilities- Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.\nBecause the Company expects to be entitled to a breakage amount for a liability resulting from the sale of a prepaid stored-value product, the Company utilized the Redemption Pattern methodology. Under this methodology, the Company shall derecognize the amount related to the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur.\nThe Company establishes a liability upon the issuance of merchandise credits and the sale of gift cards. Breakage income related to gift cards which are no longer reportable under state escheatment laws of approximately $65,000 and $10,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, is recorded in other income in our consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense is charged to operations as incurred. Advertising expense totaled approximately $445,000 and $350,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of inventory acquired as part of a business combination is based on a three-part valuation utilizing the comparable sales method which is based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The comparative sales method utilizes the actual or expected selling prices of finished goods to customers in the ordinary course of business as the base amount that must be adjusted for factors that are generally relevant in determining the Fair Value of the inventory including:\nthe time that would be required to dispose of this inventory;\nthe expenses that would be expected to be incurred in the disposition; and\na profit commensurate with the amount of investment in the assets and the degree of risk.\nThe fair value of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is based on a third-party valuation utilizing the indirect method of cost approach which is based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. In the indirect method of Cost Approach, the Reproduction Cost New for each asset or group of assets is determined by indexing the original capitalized cost basis. The cost basis generally includes the base cost of the asset and certain contributory costs, such as sales tax, freight and handling charges, installation, general contractors costs, and engineering and design costs. The index factors used in this analysis are based on the asset type and manufacture date. Index factors were derived from various published sources including Marshall Valuation Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe fair value of debt assumed as part of a business combination is discounted utilizing implied interest rates, as applicable, which is based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of the Companys assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred taxes if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes penalties and interest accrued related to income tax liabilities in the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSignificant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position. The Company uses a two-step process to evaluate tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Company in future periods.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company leases retail stores, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, and office space. These assets and properties are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates through 2046 with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which are classified as either operating or finance leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases percentage rent and require it to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs.\nFor contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2019, the Company assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, it determines that a lease exists when (i) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) obtains the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset and (iii) it has the right to direct the use of the asset.\nAt the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any prepayments to the lessor and initial direct costs, such as brokerage commissions, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of the Companys incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying lease. The incremental borrowing rates used for the initial measurement of lease liabilities as of October 1, 2019 were based on the original lease terms.\nLease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (i) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (ii) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (iii) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of the Companys real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate, such as sales and value-added taxes, the Companys proportionate share of actual property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, and utilities. The Company has elected an accounting policy, as permitted by ASC 842, not to account for such payments as part of related lease payments. Consequently, such payments are recognized as operating expenses when incurred.\nLease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Amortization of the right-of-use asset for operating leases reflects amortization of the lease liability, any differences between straight-line expense and related lease payments during the accounting period, and any impairments. Finance lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense, and the related asset is depreciated as described under Property and Equipment above.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company from time to time grants restricted stock awards and options to employees, non-employees and Company executives and directors. Such awards are valued based on the grant date fair-value of the instruments. The value of each award is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per share. Under ASC 260 basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, except that it does not include unvested restricted stock subject to cancellation. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, options, restricted shares and convertible preferred stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted shares, options and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Convertible preferred stock is reflected on an if-converted basis.\nSegment Reporting\nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a Companys management organizes segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has three operating segments (See Note 19).\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts in each state the Company has business operations. Accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 per institution as of September 30, 2022. At times, balances may exceed federally insured limits.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses instead of incurred losses. It also modified the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provided a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and the interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), codified as ASC 848 (ASC 848). The purpose of ASC 848 is to provide optional guidance to ease the potential effects on financial reporting of the market-wide migration away from Interbank Offered Rates to alternative reference rates. ASC 848 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference a reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Effective December 31, 2021, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) replaced the USD London Interbank-Offered Rate (LIBOR) for most financial benchmarking. The guidance may be applied upon issuance of ASC 848 through December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Issuers Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This update provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. This update is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, however, adoption of this ASU is anticipated to have no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nNote 3:\tLeases\nAs discussed in Note 5 below, on June 28, 2022, Precision acquired all of the capital stock of Kinetic and certain Real Estate assets used in its operations. As of the date of execution of the Real Estate purchase, Precision sold the Real Estate, in exchange for which Precision entered into a 20-year lease, with two options to renew for an additional five years each, which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. This transaction is being treated as a sales and leaseback arrangement for accounting purposes, as described in ASC 842 Leases.\nAs discussed in Note 5 below, on July 1, 2022, Marquis acquired certain assets and intellectual property related to the carpet-backing operations of Better Backers. In connection with the acquisition, Marquis entered into two 20-year building leases, with two options to renew for an additional five years each, which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. These leases are being treated as finance leases for accounting purposes, as described in ASC 842 Leases.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is 11.2 years. The Companys weighted average discount rate for operating leases is 6.15%. Total cash payments for operating leases for the year ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $9.9 million.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for finance leases is 29.3 years. The Companys weighted average discount rate for finance leases is 13.55%. Total cash payments for finance leases for the year ended September 30, 2022 were approximately $519,000.\nThe following table details the Company's right of use assets and lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in $000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nRight of use asset - operating leases\n$\n33,659\n$\n30,466\nLease liabilities:\nCurrent - operating\n7,851\n7,202\nCurrent - finance\n-\nLong term - operating\n30,382\n26,996\nLong term - finance\n19,568\n2,347\nTotal present value of future lease payments of operating leases as of September 30, 2022 (in 000s):\nTwelve months ended September 30,\n$\n10,056\n8,584\n6,701\n5,171\n4,069\nThereafter\n19,812\nTotal\n54,393\nLess implied interest\n(16,160\n)\nPresent value of payments\n$\n38,233\nTotal present value of future lease payments of finance leases as of September 30, 2022 (in 000s):\nTwelve months ended September 30,\n$\n1,942\n2,012\n2,088\n2,806\n1,955\nThereafter\n71,623\nTotal\n82,426\nLess implied interest\n(62,641\n)\nPresent value of payments\n$\n19,785\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, in connection with the winding down of ApplianceSmart's operations (see Note 17), the Company recorded a loss on write-off of an ROU of approximately $522,000 related to the decision to close the one remaining ApplianceSmart retail location in operation. There were no such transactions during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNote 4: Variable Interest Entity\nOn June 14, 2021 (the Execution Date), the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding membership interests in Salomon Whitney LLC, a New York limited liability company d/b/a SW Financial (SW Financial), for approximately $7.0 million. SW Financial is a broker-dealer that is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as SEC #8-67688, and with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), having Central Registration Depository #145012.\nOn the Execution Date, SW Affiliated Holdings LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Purchaser), entered into a definitive Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Angia Holdings LLC, a New York limited liability company (the Seller), and SW Financial. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser agreed to acquire from the Seller all of the outstanding membership interests (the Units) in SW Financial on the following terms:\non the Execution Date, the Purchaser acquired 24.9% of the Units in exchange for, among other consideration described in the Purchase Agreement, an initial payment to the Seller of approximately $1.7 million and a non-refundable deposit to the Seller in the amount of approximately $4.2 million;\nthe remaining 75.1% of the Units (the Remaining Units) were deposited into escrow with the Sellers legal counsel; and\nan additional $1.0 million will be paid to the Seller at the earliest of FINRAs approval of the change in control of SW Financial, or December 31, 2021, of which $200,000 has already be paid.\nThe closing (the Closing) of the acquisition of the Remaining Units by the Purchaser is subject to customary conditions, including, approval by FINRA. On the Execution Date, the Purchaser and the Seller entered into an amended and restated operating agreement (the Operating Agreement) of SW Financial that governs the management of SW Financial from and after the Effective Date.\nOn the Execution Date, the two principals of the Seller entered into employment agreements with SW Financial. Each employment agreement provides that each principal shall be entitled to, among other things, an annual base salary, a cash bonus equal to a specified percentage of SW Financials annual adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization for a specified period, and severance benefits if an employee is terminated without cause, contingent upon the relevant principal agreeing to a general release of claims in favor of SW Financial following termination of employment in certain circumstances. Each employment agreement also contains confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions.\nThe Company determined that SW Financial should be accounted for as a VIE because the equity holder lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact SW Financial's economic performance. This conclusion is based upon SW Financials amended and restated operating agreement for which the Company has representation for three of five board members, which conveys to the Company all significant operating decisions and responsibilities. In addition, the purchase price is fixed at $7.0 million and if FINRA does not approve, the Company has the ability to reapply for approval as well as sell the company. In the event of a sale, the Company is entitled to all proceeds and therefore bares the risk and reward of SW Financial. As such, the Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of SW Financial as it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact SW Financials economic performance and the obligation to absorb profits and/or losses of SW Financial that could potentially be significant to SW Financial.\nSW Financial meets the definition of a business as per FASB Topic ASC 810, Consolidation (Topic 810) (\"ASC 810\"), and therefore the Company applied the guidance in ASC 810 for initial consolidation of a VIE that is a business when consolidating SW Financials financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nUnder the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $3.7 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their estimates of fair value available as of June 14, 2021 as calculated by a third-party appraisal firm. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for SW Financial to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and goodwill (in $000s):\nTotal purchase price\n$\n7,000\nAccounts payable\nAccrued liabilities\n1,031\nTotal liabilities assumed\n1,043\nTotal consideration\n8,043\nAccounts receivable\nIntangible assets\n3,570\nTotal assets acquired\n4,326\nTotal goodwill\n$\n3,717\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes.\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed were classified within the fair value hierarchy table below in accordance with our fair value measurements policy (see Note 2).\nLevel 1\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAccounts receivable, net\n$\n$\n-\n$\nIntangible assets\n-\n3,570\n3,570\nAccounts payable\n-\nAccrued liabilities\n1,031\n-\n1,031\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has withdrawn its application for FINRA approval, and is assessing its strategic options going forward. The balance of the additional $1.0 million due to the Seller, as discussed above, was paid in January 2021, per mutual agreement between the Company and the Seller.\nNote 5: Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Kinetic\nOn June 28, 2022, Precision Marshall (Precision) acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Kinetic Co., Inc. (Kinetic), a Wisconsin corporation, which was accomplished through a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement). In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Precision also entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with Plant B-6, LLC, an affiliate of Kinetic, pursuant to which Precision received all of Kinetic's right, title, and interest in and to the land and improvements (collectively, the Real Estate) that Kinetic uses in its operations. The combined purchase price for the Kinetic shares and Real Estate was approximately $25.0 million, which was funded with approximately $11.0 million in borrowings under the companys credit facility, approximately $8.3 million in proceeds from sale and leaseback of the Real Estate, a subordinated promissory note in the amount of $3.0 million to the Seller of Kinetic, $1.7 million of cash on-hand, a contingent earn-out liability valued at $997,000, and a working capital adjustment of approximately $400,000, which was paid in cash.\nAs of the date of acquisition, Precision entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with a third-party, independent of the Kinetic sellers, for the Real Estate. The sale price of the Real Estate was approximately $8.9 million, subject to closing fees of approximately $547,000.\nThe provisions of the lease agreement include a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. The base rent under the lease agreement is $600,000 for the first year of the term and a 2% per annum escalator. The Lease Agreement is a net lease, such that the lessees are also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the Real Property incurred by the lessor. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The proceeds, net of closing fees, from the sale-leaseback were used to assist in funding the acquisition of Kinetic.\nUnder the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $3.3 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their estimates of fair value available as of June 28, 2022, as calculated by an independent third-party firm. Goodwill arising from the acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Kinetic to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and goodwill as of September 30, 2022 (in $000s):\nTotal purchase price\n$\n25,044\nAccounts payable\nAccrued liabilities\n1,848\nTotal liabilities assumed\n2,419\nTotal consideration\n27,463\nCash\nAccounts receivable\n3,073\nInventory\n6,429\nProperty, plant and equipment\n12,855\nIntangible assets\n1,000\nOther assets\nTotal assets acquired\n24,124\nTotal goodwill\n$\n3,339\nProforma Information\nThe table below presents selected proforma information for the Company for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, assuming that the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2020 (the beginning of the Companys 2021 fiscal year), pursuant to ASC 805-10-50 (in $000's).

No liabilities were assumed as part of the acquisition. The purchase price, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, was approximately $3.2 million, which is comprised of $1.8 million that was paid upon closing, and the $1.4 million present value of $1.5 million of non-compete payments to be made over a 24-month period. In order to expedite the transaction, the acquisition was originally made by Live, and the $1.8 million paid upon closing was funded with borrowings under the Lives credit line with Isaac Capital Group (ICG). On August 18, 2022, Marquis repaid the $1.8 million to ICG and assumed ownership of Better Backers.\nIn connection with the acquisition, Marquis entered into two 20-year building leases with Spyglass Estate Planning, LLC, a related party (see Note 16), with two options to renew for an additional five years each. The fair value of the buildings and improvement is approximately $9.3 million. The provisions of the lease agreements include an initial 24-month month-to-month rental period, during which the lessee may cancel with 90-day notice, followed by a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that it will not cancel during the initial 24-month term, and that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The base rent under the lease agreements is approximately $73,000 and $32,000 per month, respectively, for the first year of the term, and a 2.5% per annum escalator. The lease agreements are each net leases, such that the lessee is also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the property. The Company has evaluated each lease and determined the rent amounts to be at market rates. These leases are being treated as finance leases for accounting purposes, as described in ASC 842 Leases.\nUnder the purchase price allocation, no goodwill was recognized. The values assigned to the assets acquired are based on their estimates of fair value available as of July 1, 2022, as calculated by management. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Better Backers to the acquired identifiable assets (in $000s):\nTotal purchase price\n$\n3,166\nInventory\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2,118\nIntangible assets\nTotal assets acquired\n3,166\nNote 6: Property and Equipment\nThe following table details the Company's property and equipment as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in $000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nProperty and equipment, net:\nBuilding and improvements\n$\n26,761\n$\n11,737\nLand\n2,029\n2,029\nTransportation equipment\nMachinery and equipment\n53,739\n35,284\nFurnishings and fixtures\n4,407\n3,907\nOffice, computer equipment and other\n3,699\n2,792\n91,257\n56,199\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n(26,667\n)\n(20,567\n)\n$\n64,590\n$\n35,632\nDepreciation expense was approximately $6.2 million and $6.3 million for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 7: Intangibles\nThe Companys intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles, trade names, licenses for the use of internet domain names, Universal Resource Locators, or URLs, software, and marketing and technology related intangibles.\nThe following table details the Company's intangible assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in $000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nIntangible assets, net:\nDomain name and marketing related intangibles\n$\n$\nCustomer relationship intangibles\n4,598\n6,089\nPurchased software\n5,993\n6,935\nLess: Accumulated amortization\n(2,149\n)\n(2,239\n)\n$\n3,844\n$\n4,697\nIntangible amortization expense was approximately $960,000 and $522,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIn connection with the quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment, as discussed above, the Company performed quantitative impairment testing of SW Financial's other indefinite-lived intangible assets and found these to also be impaired. As such, for the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.2 million, which included approximately $1.1 million in impairment of customer relationships and $59,000 of trade names. No such impairment occurred for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets that have net balances (in $000s):\nAs of September 30,\n$\nThereafter\n$\n3,844\nNote 8: Goodwill\nThe following table details the Company's goodwill as of September 30, 2022 (in 000s):\nRetail\nFlooring Manufacturing\nSteel Manufacturing\nCorporate\nTotal\nSeptember 30, 2020\n$\n36,947\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n37,754\nAdditions\n-\n-\n-\n3,717\n3,717\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSeptember 30, 2021\n36,947\n-\n3,717\n41,471\nAdditions\n-\n-\n3,339\n-\n3,339\nImpairment\n-\n-\n-\n(3,717\n)\n(3,717\n)\nSeptember 30, 2022\n$\n36,947\n$\n$\n3,339\n$\n-\n$\n41,093\nThe Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (see Note 2). Goodwill recognized during the year ended September 30, 2022 was approximately $3.3 million, and was due to the acquisition of Kinetic. Goodwill recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021 was approximately $3.7 million, and was due to the consolidation of SW Financial as a VIE (see Note 4).\nDuring the fourth quarter of the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing, which resulted in an impairment to SW Financial's goodwill. The results of the impairment test indicated that, due to downturns in the financial market, which caused a reduction in revenue, the carrying value of SW Financial's goodwill exceeded its estimated fair value, and, thus, goodwill was fully impaired. Consequently, as of the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge in the amount of $3.7 million for the full amount of SW Financial's goodwill. No such impairment occurred for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNote 9: Accrued Liabilities\nThe following table details the Company's accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in 000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nAccrued liabilities:\nAccrued payroll and bonuses\n$\n4,838\n$\n4,765\nAccrued sales and use taxes\n1,905\n1,692\nAccrued property taxes\nAccrued rent\nAccrued gift card and escheatment liability\n1,696\n1,593\nAccrued interest payable\nAccrued accounts payable and bank overdrafts\n1,731\nAccrued professional fees\n1,924\n4,937\nCustomer deposits\nAccrued expenses - other\n3,189\n2,638\n$\n16,486\n$\n17,048\nApplianceSmart accrued liabilities of approximately $2.6 million is included in debtor in possession liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2021.

Marquis ability to borrow under the BofA Revolver is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including meeting all loan covenants under the credit agreement with BofA.\nThe BofA Revolver bears interest at a variable rate based on a base rate plus a margin. The current base rate is the greatest of (i) Bank of America prime rate, (ii) the current federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) 30-day Term SOFR plus 0.11448% credit spread adjustment plus the margin, which varies, depending on the fixed coverage ratio table below (Effective December 31, 2021, SOFR replaced the USD LIBOR for most financial benchmarking). Levels I - V determine the interest rate to be charged Marquis and is based on the fixed charge coverage ratio achieved. The Level V interest rate is adjusted up or down on a quarterly basis going forward based upon the above fixed coverage ratio achieved by Marquis. The BofA Revolver places certain restrictions and covenants on Marquis, including a limitation on asset sales, additional liens, investment, loans, guarantees, acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness for Marquis to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.05 to 1, tested as of the last day of each month for the twelve consecutive months ending on such day.\nThe advance rate in certain circumstances for inventory is 46.7% for raw materials, 0% for work-in-process, and 66.4% for finished goods subject to eligibility, special reserves and advance limit of the lessor of $12.5 million or 65% of the value of eligible inventory. Letters of credit reduce the amount available to borrow under the BofA Revolver by an amount equal to the face value of the letters of credit.\nLevel\nFixed Charge Coverage Ratio\nTerm SOFR Revolver Loan\nBase Rate\nRevolver Loan\nI\n<1.20 to 1.00\n2.25\n%\n1.25\n%\nII\n>1.20 to 1.00 but <1.50 to 1.00\n2.00\n%\n1.00\n%\nIII\n>1.50 to 1.00 but <1.75 to 1.00\n1.75\n%\n0.75\n%\nIV\n>1.75 to 1.00 but <2.00 to 1.00\n1.50\n%\n0.50\n%\nV\n>2.00 to 1.00\n1.25\n%\n0.25\n%\nThe following tables summarize the BofA Revolver for the years ended and as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively (in $000s):\nDuring the year ended September 30,\nCumulative borrowing during the period\n$\n148,015\n$\n135,035\nCumulative repayment during the period\n136,928\n134,843\nMaximum borrowed during the period\n11,210\n-\nWeighted average interest for the period\n3.68\n%\n0.00\n%\nAs of September 30,\nTotal availability\n$\n13,804\n$\n23,321\nTotal outstanding\n10,143\n-\nLoan with Encina Business Credit, LLC\nOn July 14, 2020, Precision Marshall entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Encina Business Credit, LLC, as Agent (the Agent).

Holders of the preferred shares are entitled to convert them into shares of our common stock on a 1:0.005 basis together with payment of $85.50 per converted share.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company accrued dividends of approximately $720 and $720, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, accrued dividends were approximately $200 payable to holders of Series E preferred stock.\nCommon Stock\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 3,074,833 and 1,582,334 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.\nTreasury Stock\nFor year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company purchased 86,451 and 35,435 shares of its common stock on the open market (treasury shares), respectively, for approximately $2.7 million and $421,000, respectively.

The Company and ICG previously entered into agreements whereby if the warrants were not exercised on or before the applicable expiration date, the applicable expiration date was deemed automatically extended for successive two-year periods, immediately prior to such expiration. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $462 related to the extension of warrants that expired during this period. There were no such adjustments made during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Basic weighted average common shares outstanding do not include shares of restricted stock that have not yet vested, although such shares are included as outstanding shares in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the additional common shares issuable in respect of restricted share awards, stock options and convertible preferred stock. Preferred stock dividends are subtracted from net earnings to determine the amount available to common stockholders.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:\nYears Ended September 30,\nBasic\nNet income\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,197\nLess: preferred stock dividends\n-\n-\nNet income applicable to common stock\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,197\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n3,116,214\n1,566,288\nBasic income per share\n$\n7.94\n$\n19.92\nDiluted\nNet income applicable to common stock\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,197\nAdd: preferred stock dividends\n-\n-\nNet income applicable for diluted earnings per share\n$\n24,741\n$\n31,197\nWeighted average common shares outstanding\n3,116,214\n1,566,288\nAdd: Options\n39,082\n37,069\nAdd: Series B Preferred Stock\n-\n1,578,950\nAdd: Series E Preferred Stock\nAssumed weighted average common shares\noutstanding\n3,155,535\n3,182,546\nDiluted income per share\n$\n7.84\n$\n9.80\nThere are 21,000 and zero options to purchase shares of common stock that are anti-dilutive, and are not included in the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, diluted earnings per share computations, respectively.\nNote 16: Related Party Transactions\nDuring 2015, Marquis entered into a mezzanine loan in the amount of up to $7.0 million (the ICF Loan) with Isaac Capital Fund I, LLC (ICF), a private lender whose managing member is Jon Isaac, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer (see Note 11).\nOn April 9, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit promissory note whereby ICG agreed to provide the Company with a $1.0 million revolving credit facility (the ICG Revolver) (see Note 11).\nCustomer Connexx LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of JanOne Inc. (formerly Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc.), rents approximately 9,900 square feet of office space from the Company at its Las Vegas office which totals 16,500 square feet. JanOne Inc. paid the Company approximately $218,000 and $190,000 in rent and other common area reimbursed expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Tony Isaac, a member of the Board of Directors of the Company and Virland Johnson, former Chief Financial Officer of the Company, are President and Chief Executive Officer and members of the Board of Directors, and Chief Financial Officer of JanOne Inc., respectively.\nOn April 25, 2018, ASH delivered to the Seller the ApplianceSmart Note in the Original Principal Amount, as such amount may be adjusted per the terms of the ApplianceSmart Note. The ApplianceSmart Note is effective as of April 1, 2018 and matures on the Maturity Date. The ApplianceSmart Note bears interest at 5% per annum with interest payable monthly in arrears. Ten percent of the outstanding principal amount will be repaid annually on a quarterly basis, with the accrued and unpaid principal due on the Maturity Date. ApplianceSmart has agreed to guaranty repayment of the ApplianceSmart Note. The remaining approximately $2.6 million of the Purchase Price was paid in cash by ASH to the Seller. ASH may reborrow funds, and pay interest on such re-borrowings, from the Seller up to the Original Principal Amount. In connection with the discharge of certain debts of ApplianceSmart in bankruptcy (see Note 17), the balance due of approximately $2.8 million was written off. Consequently, as of September 30, 2022, there was no balance due.\nOn April 5, 2022, the Company entered into a Purchasing Agreement with ARCA Recycling, Inc. (ARCA), a wholly-owned subsidiary of JanOne. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agrees to purchase inventory from time to time for ARCA as set forth in submitted purchase orders. The inventory is owned by the Company until ARCA installs it in customer's homes, and payment by ARCA to the Company is due upon ARCA's receipt of payment from the customer. All purchases made by the Company shall be paid back by ARCA in full plus an additional five percent surcharge or broker-type fee. The term of the Agreement is one year, and automatically renews if not terminated by either party. As of September 30, 2022, the amount due from ARCA was approximately $518,000, and the inventory balance was approximately $125,000. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recorded broker fees of approximately $99,000.\nIn connection with the purchase of Vintage Stock, on November 3, 2016, Vintage Stock Affiliated Holdings, LLC (VSAH) and Vintage Stock entered into a seller financed mezzanine loan in the amount of $10.0 million with the previous owners of Vintage Stock.

As of June 30, 2022, the amount was fully repaid.\nOn July 10, 2020, the Company executed a promissory note (the Spriggs Promissory Note) in favor of Spriggs Investments, LLC (Spriggs Investments), a limited liability company whose sole member is Rodney Spriggs, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Vintage Stock, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, that memorializes a loan by Spriggs Investments to the Company in the initial principal amount of $2.0 million (the Spriggs Loan). The Spriggs Loan originally matured on July 10, 2022; however, the maturity date was extended to July 10, 2023, pursuant to unanimous consent of the Board of Directors. The Spriggs Promissory Note bears simple interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum.

The building leases are for 20-years with two options to renew for an additional five years each (see Note 5 above). The provisions of the lease agreements include an initial 24-month month-to-month rental period, during which the lessee may cancel with 90-day notice, followed by a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. The Company has evaluated each lease and determined the rent amounts to be at market rates.\nSale of ApplianceSmart Contracting\nOn April 22, 2020, the Company sold ApplianceSmart Contracting Inc. (ApplianceSmart Contracting) to Michelle Cooper, a related party as a result of her relationship with Virland A. Johnson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, for $60,000. In connection with the sale, and under the terms of a purchase and sale agreement and a secured promissory note (the ASC Note), the Company agreed to loan ApplianceSmart Contracting up to approximately $382,000 to satisfy then outstanding sales tax obligations owed by ApplianceSmart Contracting. Advances under the loan are only made by the Company to ApplianceSmart Contracting upon the presentation of evidence by ApplianceSmart Contracting of the satisfaction of one or more outstanding state sales tax amounts. Advances bear interest at 8.0% per annum. The loan matures on September 30, 2022 or on such earlier date as provided in the Note. The loan is guaranteed by the related party and secured by the assets of ApplianceSmart Contracting. At the closing of the sale transaction, the Company advanced ApplianceSmart Contracting $60,000. As of September 30, 2022, the note was paid in full.\nNote 17: Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nSEC Investigation\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC and a letter from the SEC stating that it is conducting an investigation. The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Companys financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc., and the change in auditors. On August 12, 2020, three of the Companys corporate executive officers (together, the Executives) each received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC relating to the Companys SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a Wells Notice from the staff of the SEC relating to the Companys previously-disclosed SEC investigation. The Wells Notices relate to, among other things, the Companys reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives to allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. The Company and the Executives maintain that their actions were appropriate, and are vigorously defending against any and all allegations brought forth.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Companys Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC inquiry and provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018.\nOn August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint (the SEC Complaint) in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company.\nThe SEC Complaint alleges financial, disclosure and reporting violations against the Company under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5. The SEC Complaint also alleges various claims against certain executive officers under Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 13b2-2. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against the Company. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.\nThe Company continues to assert that the SECs pursuit of this matter will not result in any benefit to investors and instead will only serve as a distraction from core business. On October 1, 2021, the Company and two of its executive officers as defendants (collectively, the Defendants), filed their motions with the court to dismiss the complaint. The SEC filed its response opposing the motions on November 1, 2021. The Defendants filed their reply to the SECs opposition on November 15, 2021. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the motions to dismiss.\nApplianceSmart Bankruptcy and Other ApplianceSmart Litigation Matters\nOn Feb 28, 2022, the court approved ApplianceSmarts plan for reorganization (the Plan), discharging ApplianceSmart of certain debts according to the Plan resulting in the Company recording a gain of approximately $11.4 million, which includes a write-off or adjustment of approximately $11.5 million on the settlement of debts and other liabilities, offset by payments subject to the bankruptcy that were not included as debtor-in-possession liabilities of approximately $149,000. As of April 1, 2022, the Company has ceased operations at its one existing location, and is in the process of winding down operations, which will be immaterial to the financial statements.\nWarranties\nDuring 2019, the Company became the principal for certain extended warranties, as a result, warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. The following table summarizes the warranty reserve activity for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in $000s):\nBeginning balance, September 30, 2020\n$\nWarranties issued/accrued\n-\nWarranty settlements\n(101\n)\nEnding balance, September 30, 2021\nWarranty issued/accrued\n-\nWarranties settlements\n(70\n)\nEnding balance, September 30, 2022\n$\nNote 18: Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nIncome tax expense for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nCurrent expense:\nFederal\n$\n$\n3,830\nState\n1,015\n4,845\nDeferred expense:\nFederal\n5,051\n3,474\nState\n6,022\n3,817\nTotal income tax expense\n$\n6,875\n$\n8,662\nA reconciliation of the differences between the effective and statutory income tax rates for years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nFederal statutory rates\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit\n4.0\n%\n2.4\n%\nPermanent differences\n3.2\n%\n(0.9\n)%\nBankruptcy gain exclusion\n(9.0\n)%\n0.0\n%\nStock compensation\n3.8\n%\n1.7\n%\nPPP loan forgiveness\n0.0\n%\n(3.3\n)%\nProperty and equipment adjustment\n0.0\n%\n0.5\n%\nChange in valuation allowance\n(0.2\n)%\n(0.6\n)%\nOther\n(1.0\n)%\n1.0\n%\nEffective rate\n21.8\n%\n21.8\n%\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of (in $000s):\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred income tax assets (liabilities):\nAllowance for bad debts\n$\n$\nAccrued expenses\n(172\n)\nInventory\n1,132\nAccrued compensation\nNet operating loss\nTax credits\nStock compensation\n1,466\nIntangibles\n(2,952\n)\n(2,491\n)\nProperty & equipment\n(8,843\n)\n(4,822\n)\nRight of use assets\n(8,817\n)\n(7,616\n)\nLease liabilities\n9,609\n9,136\nOther\nLess: Valuation allowance\n(786\n)\n(851\n)\nTotal deferred income tax asset (liability)\n$\n(8,818\n)\n$\n(2,796\n)\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of none and approximately $7.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.

The 2018 through 2021 tax years are open to examination by the various federal and state jurisdictions.\nThe Company evaluates all available evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is needed to reduce its deferred tax assets. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of its existing tax benefits will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $0.8 million at September 30, 2022 to reduce its deferred tax assets.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which includes a new minimum tax on certain large corporations and an excise tax on stock buybacks. We do not anticipate this legislation will have a material impact for the Company.\nThe Company annually conducts an analysis of its tax positions and has concluded that it has no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2022. The Companys policy is to record uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nNote 19: Segment Reporting\nThe Company operates in four operating segments which are characterized as: (1) Retail, (2) Flooring Manufacturing, (3) Steel Manufacturing, and (4) Corporate and Other. The Retail segment consists of Vintage Stock and ApplianceSmart; the Flooring Manufacturing Segment consists of Marquis; and the Steel Manufacturing Segment consists of Precision Marshall.\nThe following tables summarize segment information for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\n% of\n% of Total\nNet\nRevenue\nTotal\nRevenue\nNet\nRevenue\nTotal\nRevenue\nRetail\n$\n86,156\n30.0\n%\n$\n88,845\n32.5\n%\nFlooring manufacturing\n130,850\n45.6\n%\n130,223\n47.7\n%\nSteel manufacturing\n60,617\n21.1\n%\n49,302\n18.1\n%\nCorporate and other\n9,290\n3.2\n%\n4,611\n1.7\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n286,913\n100.0\n%\n$\n272,981\n100.0\n%\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenues\nRetail\n$\n86,156\n$\n88,845\nFlooring Manufacturing\n130,850\n130,223\nSteel Manufacturing\n60,617\n49,302\nCorporate & Other\n9,290\n4,611\n$\n286,913\n$\n272,981\nGross profit\nRetail\n$\n45,583\n$\n48,059\nFlooring Manufacturing\n31,908\n37,893\nSteel Manufacturing\n16,878\n11,954\nCorporate & Other\n3,458\n1,557\n$\n97,827\n$\n99,463\nOperating income (loss)\nRetail\n$\n12,628\n$\n16,340\nFlooring Manufacturing\n14,154\n20,203\nSteel Manufacturing\n8,866\n5,869\nCorporate & Other\n(9,721\n)\n(6,622\n)\n$\n25,927\n$\n35,790\nDepreciation and amortization\nRetail\n$\n1,247\n$\n1,499\nFlooring Manufacturing\n3,331\n3,721\nSteel Manufacturing\n1,983\n1,440\nCorporate & Other\n$\n7,168\n$\n6,791\nInterest expense, net\nRetail\n$\n$\n1,578\nFlooring Manufacturing\n1,883\n2,049\nSteel Manufacturing\n1,312\n1,046\nCorporate & Other\n$\n4,209\n$\n5,205\nIncome before provision for income taxes\nRetail\n$\n23,197\n$\n15,789\nFlooring Manufacturing\n11,828\n22,742\nSteel Manufacturing\n5,201\n5,239\nCorporate & Other\n(8,610\n)\n(4,091\n)\n$\n31,616\n$\n39,679\nYear Ended September 30,\nTotal Assets\nRetail\n$\n72,166\n$\n59,760\nFlooring manufacturing\n130,440\n94,853\nSteel manufacturing\n72,269\n33,635\nCorporate and other\n3,762\n23,490\nConsolidated totals\n$\n278,637\n$\n211,738\nNote 20: Subsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-K, and determined that there have been no events that have occurred that would require adjustments to our disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure control and Procedures. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, as of September 30, 2022, we concluded that the Company's disclosure, controls, and procedures were effective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management, including the Companys CEO and CFO, do not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or the Companys internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. These inherent limitations include the following: judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes, controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nOur management assessed the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) of 2013 regarding Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, as of September 30, 2022, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively.\nA material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the companys financial reporting.\nAs of September 30, 2021, management noted the following deficiencies that management believes to be material weaknesses:\nThe Company does not have sufficient written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\nManagement has not established appropriate and rigorous procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting for all of its subsidiaries; and\nManagement does not have sufficient resources to maintain adequate segregation of duties and maintain its internal control environment.\nThese material weaknesses resulted in immaterial misstatements that were corrected prior to the issuance of the Company's financial statements. However, these material weaknesses created a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement(s) of the financial statements could occur without being prevented or detected on a timely basis\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses. Management took steps to remediate these material weaknesses, including revamping our risk assessment process to better respond to accounting and process risks created by future changes in our business and other non-routine transactions, increasing the depth and experience within our accounting and finance organization, and designing and implementing improved processes and internal controls. These steps were completed by the fourth quarter of 2022 and the material weaknesses were successfully remediated as of September 30, 2022. If other material weaknesses or control deficiencies occur in the future, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Except for the remediation of the material weaknesses previously described, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

The SEC Complaint alleges financial, disclosure and reporting violations against the Company under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5.

Only those directors who do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude them from being independent within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules and whom the Board affirmatively determines have no relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director are considered to be independent directors. The Board has reviewed a number of factors to evaluate the independence of each of its members. These factors include its members current and historic relationships with the Company and its competitors, suppliers, and customers; their relationships with management and other directors; the relationships their current and former employers have with the Company; and the relationships between the Company and other companies of which a member of the Companys Board of Directors is a director or executive officer.\nAfter evaluating these factors, the Board of Directors has determined that a majority of the members of the Board, namely Messrs. Butler, Gao, and Sickmeyer, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors and that each such director is an independent director of the Company within the meaning of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and the related rules of the SEC.\nThe Board of Directors held six meetings during the year ended September 30, 2022 and took action by unanimous written consent three times.\nBoard Committees\nAudit Committee\nThe purpose of our Audit Committee is to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the integrity of our Companys accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of our financial statements, as well as our systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance; (ii) our Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the qualifications, independence and performance of our independent public accountants; and (iv) our Companys financial risk. In carrying out this purpose, the Audit Committee maintains and facilitates free and open communication between the Board, the independent public accountants, and our management.

ITEM 11. Executive Compensation\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOverview\nThe purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) is to provide material information about the Companys compensation philosophy, objectives, and other relevant policies and to explain and put into context the material elements of the disclosure that follows in this Proxy Statement with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers (in this CD&A, referred to as the NEOs). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, our NEOs were:\nJon Isaac, President and Chief Executive Officer\nWeston A. Godfrey, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of Marquis Industries\nEric Althofer , Chief Operating Officer\nDavid Verret, Chief Financial Officer\nThe Compensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee reviews the performance and compensation of the Chief Executive Officer or other principal executive officer (currently, our President and Chief Executive Officer) and the Companys other executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation of outside directors for service on the Board and for service on committees of the Board and administers the Companys stock plans.\nRole of Executives in Determining Executive Compensation\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer provides input to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of the other NEOs and offers recommendations regarding their compensation packages in light of such performance. The Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible, however, for determining the compensation of the NEOs, including the Chief Executive Officer or other principal executive officer.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nThe Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the Companys compensation programs for its executive officers should reflect the Companys performance and the value created for its stockholders. In addition, we believe the compensation programs should support the goals and values of the Company and should reward individual contributions to the Companys success. Specifically, the Companys executive compensation program is intended to:\nattract and retain the highest caliber executive officers;\ndrive achievement of business strategies and goals;\nmotivate performance in an entrepreneurial, incentive-driven culture;\nclosely align the interests of executive officers with the interests of the Companys stockholders;\npromote and maintain high ethical standards and business practices; and\nreward results and the creation of stockholder value.\nFactors Considered in Determining Compensation; Components of Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee makes executive compensation decisions on the basis of total compensation, rather than on individual components of compensation. The Compensation Committee attempts to create an integrated total compensation program structured to balance both short and long-term financial and strategic goals. Our compensation should be competitive enough to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. In this regard, we utilize a combination of two to four of the following types of compensation to compensate our executive officers:\nbase salary;\nperformance bonuses, which may be earned annually depending on the Companys achievement of pre-established goals;\ncash bonuses given at the discretion of the Board of Directors; and\nequity compensation, consisting of restricted stock and/or stock options.\nThe Compensation Committee periodically reviews each executive officers base salary and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board of Directors. Salaries are based on the following factors:\nthe Companys performance for the prior fiscal years and subjective evaluation of each executives contribution to that performance;\nthe performance of the particular executive in relation to established goals or strategic plans; and\ncompetitive levels of compensation for executive positions based on information drawn from compensation surveys and other relevant information.\nPerformance bonuses and equity compensation are awarded based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock is granted under the Companys stockholder-approved equity incentive plan(s) and is priced at 100% of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Incentive and/or non-qualified stock options are generally granted under the Companys stockholder-approved equity incentive plan(s), as well, with the exercise price of such options set at 100% of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. These grants are made with a view to linking executives compensation to the long-term financial success of the Company.\nUse of Benchmarking and Compensation Peer Groups\nThe Compensation Committee did not utilize any benchmarking measure in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and traditionally has not tied compensation directly to a specific profitability measurement, market value of the Companys common stock or benchmark related to any established peer or industry group. Salary increases are based on the terms of each NEOs employment agreement, if applicable, and correlated with the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committees assessment of each NEOs performance. The Company also generally seeks to increase or decrease compensation, as appropriate, based upon changes in an executive officers functional responsibilities within the Company. Historically, the Compensation Committee has not used outside consultants in determining the compensation of the NEOs, and no such consultants were engaged during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.\nOther Compensation Policies and Considerations; Tax Issues and Risk Management\nThe intention of the Company has been to compensate the NEOs in a manner that maximizes the Companys ability to deduct such compensation expenses for federal income tax purposes. However, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to provide compensation that is not performance-based under Section 162(m) of the Code if it determines that such compensation is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company expects to deduct all compensation expenses paid to the NEOs.\nOn an annual basis, the Compensation Committee evaluates the Companys compensation policies and practices for its employees, including the NEOs, to assess whether such policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Based on its evaluation, the Compensation Committee has determined that the Companys compensation policies and practices do not create such risks.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and principal\nStock\nOption\nAll Other\nPosition\nYear\nSalary\nBonus\nAwards\nAwards (1)\nCompensation (2)\nTotal\nJon Isaac (3)\n$\n363,462\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n64,226\n$\n427,688\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n$\n350,000\n$\n434,782\n$\n-\n$\n76,177\n$\n64,226\n$\n925,185\nWeston A.
